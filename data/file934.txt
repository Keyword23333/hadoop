9340002 here is the official emblem representing the new kingdom miranda claims god has sent him to set up
9340003 666 miranda explains is not a sign of the devil he preaches that the devil was destroyed but the number of the antichrist
9340004 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works
9340005 666 tattoos on their bodies filled an amphitheater in orlando this weekend and promised joy peace and prosperity
9340006 they believe that jesus is going to come from the sky
9340007 but that is not the way he is going to come
9340008 it is easier when they shake my hand it is easier for them to ask i am very proud to show it is a sign of love
9340009 we are just questioning their faith and their 666 tattoos
9340010 we just want to learn more so we can relate more between being a christian and believing in this and who the true jesus is
9340011 666 on his arm calls himself the antichrist and whose alleged 2 million followers describe him as a living deity its pretty far out
9340012 it has been predestined and angels will make it happen
9340013 were a church respectful of the law and we will have to wait until the judge gives us an injunction
9340014 firmly fight within the law so that he can come and let the world know that jesus the man is in guatemala
9340015 ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven
9340016 who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high
9340017 and jesus said i am and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven
9340018 believe him not you either believe gods word or you dont you cannot follow jose luis de jesus miranda and jesus christ for they are diametrically opposed to each other even a basic knowledge of the word of god exposes miranda as a very evil man miranda is leading millions into hellfire with himself jesus clearly said that we shouldnt believe anyone who claims to be a modern jesus jesus knew that imposters would come as wolves in sheeps clothing matthew 7 15 jesus said to i am come in my fathers name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive

9340036 commands the son of god to come down from heaven and assume the physical characteristics of a cracker and a cup of wine that he might be consumed by the priest and the faithful
9340037 an activity in which only baptized believers were to participate
9340038 likely a reference to the messianic community psalm 80 8 following up with a doxology
9340039 concluding with another doxology that was followed by a community meal which though not detailed in the didache likely was a precursor of the pot luck suppers we see in some modern churches notice this early guidebook for christian worship sort of an early day
9340040 the flowering of mithraism occurred after the close of the new testament canon much too late for it to have influenced anything that appears in the new testament
9340041 the celebrant consecrated bread and water which he mixed with perfumed haoma juice and ate this food while performing the functions of divine service
9340042 im dealing with a very difficult very personal issue and i know this is not the solution
9340043 my wife is an unbeliever sir you can perhaps prevail for all your romish miracles my wife has strong aversion to really work a miracle may lead to her conversion

9340046 and when youve seen this miracle convinced youll be say i
9340047 yes its changed from common bread and wine to truly flesh and blood begorra lass this power of mine has changed it into god
9340048 i warn you to take care for half an ounce of arsenic was mixed right in the batter but since you have its nature changed it cannot really matter
9340049 the priest has run away to gulp such mummery and tripe im not for sure quite able ill go with you and well renounce this roman catholic fable
9340050 truly truly i say to you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day

9340052 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness is for ever and ever a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom and thou made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross
9340053 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth
9340054 philip saith unto him lord shew us the father and it sufficeth us jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip
9340055 for in jesus dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily
9340056 the voice of him john the baptist that crieth in the wilderness
9340057 the jews answered jesus saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that
9340058 and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god
9340059 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god
9340060 the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old i was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was
9340061 i wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty inventions
9340062 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him
9340063 all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made
9340064 and he is before all things and by him all things consist
9340065 but thou bethlehem ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting
9340066 thus saith the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god
9340067 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty
9340068 fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death

9340073 reducing all elements of faith to the lowest common denominator
9340074 whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son
9340075 evangelicals and catholics together the christian mission in the 3rd millennium
9340076 we understand the statement that we are justified by grace through faith because of christ in terms of the substitutionary atonement and imputed righteousness of christ leading to full assurance of eternal salvation we seek to testify in all circumstances and contexts to this the historic protestant understanding of salvation by faith alone sola fide
9340077 while we view all who profess to be christian protestant and catholic and orthodox with charity and hope our confidence that anyone is truly a brother and sister in christ depends not only on the content of his or her confession but on our perceiving signs of regeneration in his or her life
9340078 though we reject proselytizing as ect defines it that is sheep stealing for denominational aggrandizement we hold that evangelism and church planting are always legitimate whatever forms of church life are present already
9340079 we understand that what we here affirm is in agreement with what the reformation traditions have meant by justification by faith alone
9340080 we agree that justification is not earned by any good works or merits of our own it is entirely gods gift conferred through the fathers sheer graciousness out of the love that he bears us in his son who suffered on our behalf and rose from the dead for our justification
9340081 the meaning of baptismal regeneration the eucharist diverse understandings of merit reward purgatory and indulgences marian devotion and the assistance of the saints in the lives of salvation
9340082 i embrace all those as brethren who love jesus and name the name of christ
9340083 i have never seen such an instrument for ecumenism as operation rescue is
9340084 has a very strong evangelical flavor nationwide but the experience here has been that the operations break down barriers that have separated churches as we stand for the common cause of the unborn child
9340085 people ive demonstrated with attended rallies with and spent time in jail with the evangelicals and others apologized again and again to me
9340086 what makes masonry so influential is the fact that of its many millions of members so many occupy leadership positions around the world in our own country there is nearly always a significant percentage of masons on the white house staff and in the cobinet senate congress supreme court and pentagon as well as in top business management
9340087 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
9340088 in his private petitions a man may petition god or jehovah allah or buddha mohammed or jesus he may call upon the god of israel or the great first cause in the masonic lodge he hears petition to the great architect of the universes finding his own deity under that name a hundred paths may wind upward around a mountain at the top they meet
9340089 masonry does not specify any god of any creed she requires merely that you believe in some deity give him what name you will any god will do
9340090 masonry is that religion around whose altars the christian the hebrew the moslem the brahman hindu the followers of confucius and zoroaster can assemble as brethren and unite in prayer
9340091 masonry makes no profession of christianity but looks forward to the time when the labor of our ancient brethren shall be symbolized by the erection of a spiritual temple in which there shall be but one altar and one worship one common altar of masonry on which the veda shastras sade zend avesta koran and holy bible shall lie untouched by sacrilegious hands and at whose shrine the hindu the persian the assyrian the chaldean the egyptian the chinese the mohammedan the jew and the christian may kneel and with one united voice celebrate the praises of the supreme architect of the universe
9340092 we are redefining in practical terms the immutable ideals that have guided us from the beginning
9340093 the richness and diversity of our religious tradition throughout history is a spiritual resource long ignored by people of faith who are often afraid to open their minds to teachings first offered outside their own system of belief but the emergence of a civilization in which knowledge moves freely and almost instantaneously through the world has spurred a renewed investigation of the wisdom distilled by all faiths this panreligious perspective may prove especially important where our global civilizations responsibility for the earth is concerned
9340094 the bible gives us a clear if unpleasant picture in the last days of history as we know it our race will be brought together in a common expression of cosmic humanism
9340095 the book written to help provide directions for a mans life so that he doesnt get lost along the way is mainly psychologically biased conjecture centering around six hebrew words
9340096 the good results that were publicly displayed did not justify the wrong way in which gods will was carried out
9340097 what have you and i to do with maintaining our influence and position at the expense of truth it is never right to do a little wrong to obtain the greatest possible good your duty is to do the right consequences are with god
9340098 if you hold to my teaching you are really my disciples then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
9340099 do you suppose i came to grant peace on earth i tell you no rather division
9340100 from now on five members in one household will be divided three against two and two against three
9340101 god loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life
9340102 the evidence of god at work is not outward results but conformity to scripture which in turn results in outward change outward change without conformity to scripture is merely human righteousness change of mind does not always equate to change of heart a genuine change of heart results in the holding of scripture in high esteem nor does it distinguish between so called essential doctrine and secondary doctrine 2 tim 3 14 17 when the holy spirit says that all scripture is given for instruction in righteousness he isnt speaking only of the so called big five doctrines the ecumenists are claiming as reason for unity he means all of scripture itself is the essential doctrine of the faith
9340103 the end does not justify the means the proper focus must be on the means itself as well as on the end results are not the final arbiter of truth ones pious demeanor is not the final arbiter of truth ones ability to call fire down from heaven is not the final arbiter of truth gods word is the only and final arbiter of truth
9340104 problemen met de authenticatie en encryptie waarvan sommige al lange tijd bekend zijn en zich in de kern van het systeem bevinden blijven een gevaar voor de gehele internet infrastructuur vormen door zowel de routering te corrumperen en die corrupte routes een probleem te laten zijn
9340105 ja je pakt het verkeer maar de controle over welk verkeer je pakt is behoorlijk beperkt in tegenstelling tot dns die je heel gericht te werk laat gaan en waar je niet van tevoren hoeft te weten welk verkeer je wilt het netwerk van het slachtoffer geeft je de interessante namen en je kunt meteen kiezen welke je wilt pakken die namen kunnen zelfs interne namen zijn waarbij je het verkeer kunt kapen van twee hosts op hetzelfde netwerksegment iets wat met bgp niet mogelijk is
9340106 we hebben nu drie aanvallen in n jaar gehad die de fundamentele onbetrouwbaarheid van routering laten zien dns bgp en snmpv3 onderstrepen het feit dat het netwerken alleen als een data transmissie systeem vertrouwd moet worden als je zeker wilt weten dat alles ok is kun je niet aannemen dan heb je cryptografische authenticatie nodig
9340107 er zijn zoveel manieren om ttl te omzeilen wat in de eerste plaats nooit als beveiligingstechnologie is ontwikkeld
9340108 maak alsjeblieft het dns niet stuk om het te redden
9340109 net zoals het niet is toegestaan om het web te slopen mag je ook niet het dns slopen
9340110 er is werkelijk geen moeilijkere it taak dan het bouwen van een pki en het is de niet ontsnappen werkelijkheid dat dnssec een nieuwe identiteitsinfrastructuur ter grote van x 509 is
9340111 evidentemente la conducta de cada gobierno es lo que va a significar la forma en que estados unidos va a tratar a esos gobiernos
9340112 como hay un conocimiento por parte del senador mccain sobre las realidades del hemisferio por el continente americano sin duda eso va a conllevar a una relaci n m s estrecha con nuestros amigos como m xico como colombia como chile per los otros gobiernos muy amigos que tiene estados unidos
9340113 est consciente que tenemos enemigos en este hemisferio y esa es otra diferencia con el candidato dem crata a la presidencia barack obama
9340114 hay una diferencia entre rusia y georgia hay una diferencia entre ch vez y el presidente colombiano alvaro uribe mccain conoce esas diferencias obama evidentemente no
9340115 mccain est consciente de que ch vez es una amenaza para todo el hemisferio que ch vez est financiando elementos desestabilizadores a trav s de todo el hemisferio hay que contrarrestar los esfuerzos de ch vez por desestabilizar las democracias en el hemisferio a trav s de la utilizaci n del poder econ mico que tiene por el petr leo
9340116 gran parte del problema que tenemos con bolivia y con ecuador es esa utilizaci n por parte del se or ch vez de los recursos de venezuela para ir incrementando su influencia y su agenda antiamericana
9340117 es muy preocupante lo que estamos viendo en esos pa ses
9340118 habr a a n m s inter s por parte del presidente de estados unidos sobre el tema cubano sobre la necesidad de ayudar a la oposici n interna y a la sociedad civil
9340119 se mantendr a el enfoque sobre la necesidad de que se siga con la actual pol tica hasta que no haya una transici n democr tica en cuba encaminada a trav s de tres pasos
9340120 legalizaci n de todos los partidos la prensa y los sindicatos obreros
9340121 porque mccain considera que es irrespetuoso la forma en que el se or obama y el congreso dem crata han tratado a colombia
9340122 es irrespetuoso tratar a m xico dici ndole que ahora hay que renegociar el acuerdo de libre comercio con nuestro vecino m s cercano
9340123 understand therefore that the lord thy god giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness for thou art a stiffnecked people
9340124 and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all nations of the earth be blessed
9340125 between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him
9340126 verily i say unto you inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren the jewish people gentiles were never called his brethren ye have done it unto me
9340127 shame on you john hagee for elevating jews over the gentiles by teaching that only the jews are jesus family mr hagee states above that
9340128 thank god for the many saved arabs in the world and saved jews too
9340129 pray for the peace of jerusalem they shall prosper that love thee
9340130 for he loveth our nation and he hath built us a synagogue
9340131 it was the mans faith that prompted the lord to heal the servant for without faith we cannot please god hebrews 11 6 hagee would actually lead us to believe that by contributing to a godless nation of rebellious jews that god is going to bless us you cannot show me that in the bible
9340132 a devout man cornelius and one that feared god with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to god always
9340133 notice that hagee assumes that cornelius is giving alms to the jews but that is not what the bible says
9340134 the jews had sinned and god was angry at them
9340135 what better location could there be for an institution single mindedly dedicated to reaching and teaching jews their heritage
9340136 so they can teach millions of jews why they shouldnt believe in jesus
9340137 teaching jews their heritage dont you realize that their heritage is corrupted the heritage which
9340138 salvation may be of the jews but 95 of jews today dont have it this is the tragic truth how could jews today still reject their own savior read it for yourself on the biggest judaism website in the world
9340139 carefully notice that jesus spoke this to nicodemus a jew who was a religious leader over the jews every lost sinner must be born again if they want to go to heaven 2nd thessalonians 1 8 applies to everyone
9340140 be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
9340141 youre right when you say that jesus got angry he got angry when people were telling his children the whores the homosexuals everyone prayed upon by the religious society the similar things that you are saying
9340142 why were those pharisees judging the woman but not the man
9340143 these scriptures are telling us to refrain from condemning others for their personal sins
9340144 a perfect example of this is recorded in 1st corinthians 5 1 where the apostle paul stated
9340145 in 1st corinthians 5 9 paul warns the church members at corinth not to have company with the fornicator
9340146 only a careless moron for a parent would allow their children to be influence by degenerate sodomites fornicators adulterers and god haters
9340147 with the lords approval joshua destroyed the city of jericho killing all the men women and children with the edge of the sword
9340148 so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appointed and there died of the people from dan even to beer sheba
9340149 the word of god is brutally honest and it offends most people these biblical facts strongly
9340150 jesus already told us that the wicked wont come to him for salvation because they love their sins
9340151 it is mans stubborn rebellion and pride that gets him killed
9340152 those who were killed in the old testament were the ones who refused to turn from their evil way
9340153 let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for
9340154 this is the same exact message that true and faithful christians are preaching to america today
9340155 youre right when you say that jesus got angry he got angry when people were telling his children the whores the homosexuals everyone prayed upon by the religious society the similar things that you are saying
9340156 i am simply taking a biblical stand against the evils which are destroying americas families and nation
9340157 jesus hated iniquity dont be fooled whoever you may be jesus hates sin and he wants all christians to stand firm against all forms of evil
9340158 herod had john the baptist arrested and put into prison because john preached against herods adulterous relationship with his brothers wife
9340159 ye that love the lord hate evil let me say everyone is not gods child most people have the foolish idea that everyone is a child of god this is simply not biblical if youve never received christ as your personal saviour believing upon his name then youre received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that
9340160 will not come to me that ye might have life
9340161 if you go to hell youll have no one to blame but yourself
9340162 andan como desesperados recogiendo firmas esto es un ridiculez para ir a la oea a qu le ir n a pedir la suspensi n o la eliminaci n de las leyes habilitantes

9340164 in the world of religion hes achieved the status of a rock star
9340165 simple self help message that congregants say is both uplifting and accessible
9340166 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves
9340167 but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man
9340168 well maybe larry caught joel osteen flat footed maybe osteen wasnt prepared
9340169 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood
9340170 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it
9340171 he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool
9340172 but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornication thefts false witness blasphemies
9340173 was unclear on the very thing in which i have dedicated my life
9340174 but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear
9340175 fire and brimstone as osteen openly confesses you do not believe the bible its that simple
9340176 i dont have it in my heart to condemn people
9340177 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
9340178 you will be eternally dying and yet never know the relief that death brings
9340179 if i believed what you and the church of god say that you believe even if england were covered with broken glass from coast to coast i would walk over it if need be on hands and knees and think it worth while living just to save one soul from an eternal hell like that
9340180 im no hero i just did what any decent human being would have done
9340181 as it is written there is none righteous no not one
9340182 but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags
9340183 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us
9340184 who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree
9340185 unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood
9340186 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name
9340187 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9340188 that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the lord thy god hath scattered thee
9340189 that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the lord thy god hath scattered thee
9340190 for he is not a jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of god
9340191 and if ye be christs then are ye abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise
9340192 now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ
9340193 and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of sion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins
9340194 and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from transgression in jacob saith the lord
9340195 my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lord of glory with respect of persons
9340196 for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye
9340197 jeremiah 11 14 the only thing christians should be praying for today concerning israel is that they would repent towards god from their unbelief and get saved israel is a wicked nation today as is america matthew 18 4 6 pronounces judgment upon anyone who messes with a christian
9340198 whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea
9340199 was because abraham was a born again christian genesis 15 6 who loved the lord
9340200 for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye belong to christ verily i say unto you he shall not lose his reward
9340201 genesis 21 18 as much as he did to abraham genesis 12 2 the word of god clearly states that god doesnt view jews as being any better than gentiles
9340202 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female
9340203 for they are not all israel which are of israel that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god
9340204 mark 13 37 the lords return may come at any time and i believe the trumpet is out of the case
9340205 it hath pleased them verily and their debtors they are for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things
9340206 every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver
9340207 ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews
9340208 in zechariah 2 8 and not because jews are better than anyone else
9340209 god promised to bless those who blessed abraham and curse those who cursed abraham because abraham was a genuine christian
9340210 that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the lord thy god hath scattered thee
9340211 but it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day that all these
9340212 behold the days come saith the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they brake although i was an husband unto them saith the lord but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more
9340213 it is ridiculous as some people today believe that hurricane katrina was punishment from god upon america for failing to help israel not so there are hundreds of reasons why god should punish america such as for the 50 000 000 murderous abortions but our relationship to the nation of israel is not one of them germany decimated the jews under hitlers reign of terror but germany is a thriving nation today rome utterly destroyed the jews in a d 70 yet still prospered for centuries to come the jews are gods chosen people i e god chose israel as the means by which to bless the world with the word of god the saviour the apostles salvation and christianity itself this is why the nation of israel is precious in the eyes of god however the bible plainly states that god is no respecter of persons acts 10 34 and that there is no difference between the jews and the gentiles romans 10 12 christians are not obligated nor expected to befriend the heathen nation of israel today luke 21 24 plainly states shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled
9340214 will be the coming of the lord jesus christ in glory revelation 19 11 21
9340215 many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivers him out of them all

9340219 so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple
9340220 and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself
9340221 but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ
9340222 can you please show me that in the word of god
9340223 therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life
9340224 and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying
9340225 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
9340226 how many souls are in hell right now who thought they were alright because the preacher didnt want to scare them away with
9340227 as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby
9340228 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace
9340229 look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else
9340230 and there is no god else beside me a just god and a saviour there is none beside me look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else

9340232 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked
9340233 you dont have to swallow it its already in you
9340234 ye will not come to me that ye might have life
9340235 o jerusalem jerusalem how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not
9340236 how often would i have gathered you together but you could not
9340237 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely
9340238 no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him
9340239 and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me
9340240 that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world
9340241 not all men are created with similar destiny but eternal life is foreordained for some and eternal damnation for others every man therefore being created for one or the other of these ends we say he is predestined either to life or to death
9340242 did it ever occur to you that nothing ever occurred to god
9340243 he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world
9340244 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love
9340245 ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you
9340246 ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you
9340247 the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that winneth souls is wise
9340248 not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
9340249 who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth
9340250 he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him
9340251 he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world
9340252 the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all
9340253 and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world
9340254 and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world
9340255 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved
9340256 for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god who is the saviour of all men specially of those that believe
9340257 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
9340258 and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but for the sins of the whole world
9340259 but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man
9340260 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all
9340261 that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man
9340262 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9340263 i wanted to be saved but jesus did not die for me
9340264 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
9340265 i must catch this last rain to london do you have a bible
9340266 then go home and find isaiah 53 6 read it carefully go in at the first all and come out at the last all and you will be saved
9340267 and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
9340268 if i come out at the last all i must believe that all my sins were laid on christ that he took my place and paid for my sins and if i rely upon that i will be saved thats what the preacher meant
9340269 he that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy
9340270 this means the man was reproved over and over again
9340271 because i have called and ye refused i have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but ye have set at nought all my counsel and would none of my reproof i also will laugh at your calamity i will mock when your fear cometh
9340272 i have called and ye have refused i have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but ye have set at nought all my counsel and would none of my reproof
9340273 ye will not come to me that ye may have life
9340274 ye stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye
9340275 ye do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye
9340276 for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men
9340277 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name
9340278 o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee ho often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not
9340279 jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ
9340280 and the very god of peace sanctify you wholly and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ
9340281 to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
9340282 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my fathers hand
9340283 i do not believe in the perseverance of the saviour
9340284 there are really only three systems which claim to set forth the way of salvation through christ and he names them
9340285 1 universalism that all will be saved 2 arminianism which holds that christ died equally and indiscriminately for every individual that saying grace is not necessarily permanent but that those who are loved of god ransomed by god and born of the holy spirit may let god wish and strive ever so much to the contrary throw away all and perish eternally and 3 calvinism
9340286 that whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
9340287 then you spend the next two or three pages talking about will and calling attention to bible verses
9340288 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost
9340289 ye will not come to me that ye might have life
9340290 we are sinners from birth as adam we hid ourselves from god
9340291 o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not
9340292 note a dead person cannot move respond walk nor anything
9340293 i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants and he arose and came to his father
9340294 for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found
9340295 for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die
9340296 and the days of adam after he had begotten seth were eight hundred years and he begat sons and daughters
9340297 death passed upon all men for that all have sinned
9340298 but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons
9340299 for whosoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god
9340300 the act of keeping or state of being kept from injury or decay
9340301 note no human is born of his own will but of the will of the parents christ says we are to be born again
9340302 how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born
9340303 that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit

9340329 revelation 18 4 all true christians will remain faithful to the religion of christ as taught in the bible and heed the warning of the apostle paul who said
9340330 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed
9340331 i have set before you life and death the blessing and the curse choose life then that you and your descendants may live by loving the lord your god heeding his voice and holding fast to him
9340332 when the family organization was revealed from heaven the patriarchal order of god and joseph began on the right and on the left to add to his family what a quaking there was in israel says one brother to another joseph says all covenants are done away and none are binding but the new covenants now suppose joseph should come and say he wanted your wife what you say to that i would tell him to go to hell this was the spirit of many in the early days of this church
9340333 what would a man of god say who felt aright when joseph asked him for his money
9340334 but there was a way in which a woman could leave a man lawfully when a woman becomes alienated in her feeling and affections from her husband it is his duty to give her a bill and set her free it would be fornication for a man to cohabit with his wife after she had thus become alienated from him also there was another way in which a woman could leave a man if the woman preferred a man higher in authority and he is willing to take her and her husband gives her up there is no bill of divorce required in this case it is right in the sight of god
9340335 the only men who become gods even the sons of god are those who enter into polygamy
9340336 thus saith the lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord
9340337 it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man
9340338 what makes us different and riles most other christian churches we call them historic or traditional christians is that we believe god restored his original church in 1830 through a young man named joseph smith jr
9340339 and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also
9340340 but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloke also
9340341 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord
9340342 accept people for who they are and not for the stereotypes given to them
9340343 compromise forsaking the word of god and accepting the false religions and wicked lifestyles of the godless
9340344 you see unsaved people have been tricked by the devil that jesus taught christians to love the world
9340345 we are to love people but hate the evil world
9340346 sadly most professed christians are too busy selling religious books making a buck criticizing each other and playing church to care about the truth
9340347 the apostle pauls preaching had caused an uproar contradicting their beliefs customs laws and traditions
9340348 does not the bible teach that charity love is the greatest

9340354 influential cardinal christoph schoenborn of vienna who has been speaking about evolution and faith has affirmed that the catholic church rejects creationism in a 2007 speech in new york he said that the first page of the bible is not a cosmological treatise about the coming to be of the world in six days he also said that the catholic faith can accept the possibility that god uses evolution as a tool
9340355 catholics are more likely than other americans to believe in evolution a survey conducted last year by the pew forum on religion and public life found 58 percent of catholics believed in evolution compared with 48 percent for the nation as a whole

9340359 the same god that created the universe that i study as a scientist is the god who spoke to the jewish people of old
9340360 mendel would be horrified to see the way in which people are being asked to make a choice between god and science
9340361 the language of god a scientist presents evidence for belief
9340362 the first page of the bible is not a cosmological treatise about the coming to be of the world in six days
9340363 the world wasnt quite ready for what he had discovered

9340367 which the bible promises to us in philippians 4 6 7 let me now share with you some truths to burn your heart 1 you dont need much faith to be saved or to get your prayers answered child like faith
9340368 but never actually stands upon the chair that is not faith it is mere optimism
9340369 the disciples had no idea of the hardships and persecutions which were to follow
9340370 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christs sake for when i am weak then am i strong
9340371 we must mature as believers to the place in our christian life where we appreciate the problems in our life we may not like them but we can learn to see the silver linings of the storm clouds in our life if well walk with god
9340372 a faith must be tested being much more precious than of gold that perisheth might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of jesus christ
9340373 the truth is that even the simplest faith would have been adequate but it pleased jesus greatly that this man had so much faith in him luke 7 9
9340374 my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations knowing this that
9340375 they profess that they know god but in works they deny him
9340376 whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son
9340377 if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him god speed
9340378 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect
9340379 oh how foolish and rebellious are so many people today who are complacent in their false righteousness
9340380 jesus paid a debt that he did not owe because we owed a debt that we could not pay
9340381 mark 7 9 oh how sinful are the hearts of humanity mankind is prone to self righteousness and rebellion against god
9340382 water baptism does not save anyone its the blood of jesus christ that washes away our sins baptismal regeneration is of the devil
9340383 he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new
9340384 he is already saved and then the change comes afterward
9340385 but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness
9340386 this scripture speaks of imposters phonies who pretend to be christians for awhile but then their true colors show eventually
9340387 salvation is a free gift which must be received as such
9340388 at first glance it sure does seem like the bible is requiring works for salvation but as you will see nothing could be further from the truth
9340389 the event which took place in genesis 15 6 was
9340390 this occurred in genesis 15 6 which is when abraham was born again
9340391 worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness
9340392 this event took place years later when isaac had grown at least old enough to speak clearly to his father genesis 22 7 james is simply saying that if a person is genuinely saved by faith then there should be some fruit good works in that persons life to show it
9340393 today a great heavenly host of angels has been released unto the earth
9340394 prayer projects faith on god and god on the world
9340395 therefore i say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them
9340396 believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them
9340397 simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you to sift you as wheat but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fall not
9340398 giving diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness
9340399 in this instance we are shown how faith centered in christs ability to
9340400 they said unto him yea lord then touched he their eyes saying according to your faith be it unto you
9340401 the guests at a certain hotel were being rendered uncomfortable by repeated strumming on a piano done by a little girl who possessed no knowledge of music they complained to the proprietor with a view to having the annoyance stopped i am sorry you are annoyed he said but the girl is the child of one of my very best guests i can scarcely ask her not to touch the piano but her father who is away for a day or so will return tomorrow you can then approach him and have the matter set right when the father returned he found his daughter in the reception room and as usual thumping on the piano he walked up behind the child and putting his arms over her shoulders took her hands in his and produced some most beautiful music thus it may be with us and thus it will be some coming day just now we can produce little but clamour and disharmony but one day the lord jesus will take hold of our hands of faith and prayer and use them to bring forth the music of the skies
9340402 as the faith is specific so the answer likewise will be definite
9340403 faith and prayer select the things and god commits himself to do the very things which faith and persevering prayer nominate and petition him to accomplish
9340404 perfect faith has always in its keeping what perfect prayer asks for
9340405 and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatever he saith
9340406 and what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and barak and of samson and of jephthae of david also and samuel and of the prophets

9340423 for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved
9340424 i explained to him that he didnt have to forsake his sins to be saved because eternal life is a
9340425 worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly
9340426 howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
9340427 in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ
9340428 the exact contrary of what is generally believed is often the truth
9340429 there is a union complementary with the thing figured lest the sign be empty because that which the lord represents in sign he effects at the same time and executes in us by the power of the spirit what indeed do we abrogate or take away from god when we teach that he acts through his
9340430 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that
9340431 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
9340432 gods church and the sacraments are also given in gods grace for the edification of the elect and the good of the world
9340433 now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you now this i say that every one of you saith i am of paul and i of apollos and i of cephas and i of christ is christ divided was paul crucified for you or were ye baptized in the name of paul i thank god that i baptized none of you but crispus and gaius lest any should say that i had baptized in mine own name
9340434 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then can be saved and jesus looking upon them saith
9340435 anyone could get saved a view that calvinists and hyper calvinists do not hold
9340436 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
9340437 no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day
9340438 for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men
9340439 will may come to be saved and spurgeon believed this john 3 16 proclaims that god loved the
9340440 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren
9340441 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that
9340442 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
9340443 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
9340444 the hearts of the godly are so effectually governed by the spirit of god that through an inflexible disposition they follow his guidance
9340445 the power of the spirit is so effectual that it necessarily retains us in yes it is true that a person cannot be saved unless god the holy spirit is working in their heart but the bible plainly teaches that its the holy spirits task to convict the world of sin righteousness and judgment
9340446 a day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as a day with the lord 2nd peter 3 8
9340447 they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us
9340448 now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment
9340449 luther does come out of catholicism but catholicism does not come out of martin luther
9340450 how much evil has been caused by the dogma ill expounded that baptism is necessary to salvation few perceive and therefore think caution the less necessary for when the opinion prevails that all are lost who happen not to be dipped in water our condition becomes worse than that of gods ancient people as if his grace were more restrained than under the law
9340451 although a laic have given baptism when compelled by necessity i know not whether any one can piously say that it ought to be repeated for if it is done without any necessity compelling it it is usurpation of anothers office but if necessity urges it is either no fault or a venial one
9340452 christ loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word
9340453 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost
9340454 not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god which is of faith
9340455 hence those who have thought that baptism is nothing else than the badge and mark by which we profess our religion before men have not attended to what was the principal thing in baptism and this is that we are to receive it in connection with the promise
9340456 what you owe to calvin and the reformers you obviously cant begin to conceive let alone have gratitude for
9340457 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god
9340458 thus every book every movie every writing is produced by a spirit the human spirit
9340459 so we see that there are different spirits at work
9340460 obviously this cannot be a final test because many false religions believe that jesus is the christ i
9340461 casting down all imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ
9340462 but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before
9340463 and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus
9340464 a time when protestants and catholics could meet together and greet each other as brothers whereas 10 years ago they could not
9340465 im not sure but what this could start me being called
9340466 anyone who makes a decision at our meetings is seen later and referred to a local clergyman protestant catholic or jewish
9340467 if a catholic steps forward there will be no attempt to convert them and their names will be given to the catholic church nearest their homes
9340468 those who come forward for counseling during a mission evening in june if they are roman catholic will be directed to a roman catholic nurture group under roman catholic counselors in their home area
9340469 i do believe that something happens at the baptism of an infant we cannot fully understand the mysteries of god but i believe that a miracle can happen in these children so that they are regenerated that is made christian through infant baptism
9340470 i think people have a hard time believing god is going to allow people to burn in literal fire forever i think the fire that is mentioned in the bible is a burning thirst for god that can never be quenched
9340471 religious myth is one of the avenues of faith and has an important place in the communication of the gospel
9340472 the virgin birth is a myth which churchmen should be free to accept or reject
9340473 i am pleased to recommend the new living translation for even greater readability and accuracy
9340474 is it really necessary to attack a man like billy graham
9340475 how many people are believers today because of david j stewart
9340476 let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holiday or of the new moon or of the sabbath days
9340477 let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind and not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increaseth with the increase of god
9340478 if man is good by nature it follows that he stays like that as long as nothing foreign to him corrupts him

9340480 the word of god is straightforward the fact that occult groups worldwide cherish the kabbalah should speak volumes to anyone who may consider it a holy book it is not
9340481 kabbalist mysticism is the basis for freemasonry rosicrucianism the illuminati knights templar and many other occult organizations their holy book is the zohar
9340482 names of power the magic circle ritual implements consecration evocation of spirits etc
9340483 kabbalism is a system of jewish mysticism and magic and is the foundational element in modern witchcraft virtually all of the great witches and sorcerers of this century were kabbalists
9340484 then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons
9340485 between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him
9340486 and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed
9340487 this made it a kind of league offensive and defensive between god and abram
9340488 likewise jack chick is very wrong about the 911 attacks the reason why america is deteriorating today and concerning his biased view in favor of the jews
9340489 jack chick ought to be trying to win both races to the lord
9340490 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world
9340491 nearly every false religion believes a person named jesus once came in a fleshly body and walked this earth
9340492 the mystery of god and of the father and of christ
9340493 some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable unto their own destruction
9340494 jws will tell you that they believe in accepting jesus christ as their savior this is enough to lure many multitudes of unsuspecting people woefully ignorant of the truth into their false religion the problem is that your being led to a false
9340495 i accepted jesus as my savior asking him to forgive me of my sins when i was a teenager i didnt know about the deity of christ or the virgin birth because i simply had not heard those things when i grew older and heard of these truths i knew in my heart that

9340522 i love to visit minneapolis but theres something about st paul thats charming and simple
9340523 it is you can hardly go anywhere in st paul that you dont see someone you know which is the great thing about it i think
9340524 if you were one of these guys when you got to town youd literally walk up to the first police officer you saw and introduce yourself
9340525 you would have to promise you would not commit a crime in the city limits of st paul you could kill anyone you wanted in minneapolis and you did

9340533 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the which liveth and abideth for ever
9340534 in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ
9340535 yes its true that secular humanists dont believe in a god or an afterlife secular humanists plead guilty as charged to these and many other claims that show the genuine and radical differences between humanism and revealed religion in fact we are proud of these differences and want to see them publicized and debated
9340536 humanists also emphasize the importance of self determination the right of individuals to control their own lives so long as they do not harm others secular humanists therefore often promote causes where traditional religion obstructs the right to self determination for example freedom of choice regarding sexual relationships reproduction and voluntary euthanasia
9340537 it is a very dangerous thing to re create god in our own image
9340538 secular humanism is utter foolishness and an abomination before the lord god
9340539 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned
9340540 i dont find any place where god says that the world is to grow better and better i look upon this world as a wrecked vessel god has given me a lifeboat and said to me moody save all you can
9340541 modern colleges and modern sciences are both the product of the evils of humanisms ideas about education and science
9340542 thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble
9340543 i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
9340544 howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men
9340545 and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition
9340546 making the word of god of none effect through your tradition which ye have delivered and many such like things do ye
9340547 beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ
9340548 do you promise that with the aid of the holy ghost you will henceforth amend your sinful life then declare by saying i do promise
9340549 finally do you believe that through me a called servant of god you will receive the forgiveness of all your sins then declare so by saying i do believe as you believe even so may it be unto you
9340550 upon this your confession i by virtue of my office as a called and ordained servant of the lord announce the grace of god unto all of you and in the stead and by the command of my lord jesus christ i forgive you all your sins in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost amen
9340551 does the lutheran preacher forgive his wifes sin also does he forgive his childrens sins and does he forgive his own
9340552 penance is also a sacrament instituted by our divine savior in which sins committed after baptism are forgiven through the absolution of the priest
9340553 no man by his own power and authority could possibly forgive sins only god can do that because sin is an offence against him but the priest as gods representative can forgive sins because god has given him the power to do so
9340554 our savior could indeed have decreed that men should receive the pardon of their sins by going directly to god with contrition but a sacrament administered by men in the name of god is a more assuring and a more effective means
9340555 the power to forgive sins by pronouncing these words of absolution is given to the priest at his ordination in order to exercise this power the priest must have jurisdiction or be authorized to act as a spiritual judge over the persons he absolves
9340556 i absolve thee from thy sins in the name of the father and of the son and the the holy ghost amen
9340557 for whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the palsy arise take up thy bed and go unto thine house and he arose and departed to his house but when the multitudes saw it they marvelled and glorified god which had given such power unto men
9340558 moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
9340559 then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send i you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the holy ghost whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are retained
9340560 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
9340561 and many other signs greek semeion miracles truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book
9340562 but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ deity i e god in human flesh the son of god by the virgin birth and that believing ye might have life through his name
9340563 he came unto his own and his own received him not
9340564 how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will
9340565 go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand
9340566 heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely ye have received freely give
9340567 for i determined not to know any thing among you save jesus christ and him crucified
9340568 he that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me
9340569 but the word which i have spoken shall be done saith the lord god
9340570 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
9340571 the lords words to the apostle peter in matthew 16 19 as to binding and to all the disciples in 18 18 signify in the former case that the apostle by his would keep unbelievers outside the kingdom of god and admit those who believed
9340572 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
9340573 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
9340574 depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels
9340575 god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar
9340576 whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are retained
9340577 knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation
9340578 signifies the speaking forth of the mind and counsel of god though much of the old testament prophecy was purely predictive it is the declaration of that which cannot be known by natural means it is the forth telling of the will of god whether with reference to the past the present or the future
9340579 study to shew thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth
9340580 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
9340581 who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us
9340582 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
9340583 wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that seeing he christ ever liveth to make intercession for them
9340584 my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin not
9340585 and he christ bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors
9340586 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god
9340587 but that ye may know that the son of man
9340588 but that ye may know that the son of man ephesians 4 32
9340589 and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses
9340590 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that 1st peter 3 18
9340591 the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the
9340592 why not are you scared to you have a right to question your pastor or priest on anything they teach
9340593 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace
9340594 and he christ said unto her thy sins are forgiven
9340595 and he christ said to the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace
9340596 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
9340597 being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his christs blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god
9340598 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us
9340599 if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his
9340600 whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are retained
9340601 i will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name
9340602 he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him
9340603 whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are retained
9340604 scripture makes clear that the lords words could not have been intended to bestow the exercise of absolution which the scripture declares is the prerogative of god alone
9340605 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
9340606 but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in
9340607 for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness
9340608 for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men
9340609 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves
9340610 heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils demons freely ye have received freely give
9340611 for whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk
9340612 even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity
9340613 jesus saith unto him or you i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
9340614 these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god

9340616 their departure from the doctrine of free and sovereign grace
9340617 whether a person wants to be labeled calvinistic or arminian or not there is no way in which they can avoid it
9340618 i wrote an article some years ago in which i pledge with preachers not to call other preachers arminians or calvinists if they are baptists they are not calvinists and they are not arminians
9340619 the christ of arminianism is not the christ of the new testament
9340620 no one has ever been or ever will be saved in the way taught by arminianism
9340621 saved under the preaching of an arminian preacher and church
9340622 many of us were saved in arminian churches under arminian preaching
9340623 understand that i do verily believe that some even many arminians are saved but i adamantly insist that they were saved in the way taught by sovereign grace
9340624 will be sovereign gracers when they do get to heaven and will shout on the banks of sweet and everlasting deliverance rejoicing because their doctrine was false
9340625 call yourselves what you will arminian is what you are
9340626 you dont have to call yourself either but not calling yourself either does not change the fact of what you are refusing to call yourself an arminian does not change the fact that that is what you are
9340627 there are some arminians who do not know that they are arminians
9340628 it does not there is nothing between them but a barren wilderness
9340629 for a simplistic slogan in order to evade the issues or avoid the studies
9340630 rather shaky it actually does not have an adequate scripture basis
9340631 ask church members to allow them to talk out of both sides of their mouths
9340632 baptist orthodoxy was preserved among the particular or calvinistic baptists
9340633 only the english particular baptists remained unscathed by the theological apostasy
9340634 return to the old paths and to our particular baptist roots
9340635 these churches are as they say called by some semi calvinists by others semi arminians
9340636 christians of the new testament times were strong believers in the greatness and sovereignty of god and consequently in the doctrines of election and predestination

9340954 the creature at your feet dismissed as a bug or a weed is a creation in and of itself it has a name a million year history and a place in the world its genome adapts it to a special niche in an ecosystem the ethical value substantiated by close examination of its biology is that the life forms around us are too old too complex and potentially too useful to be carelessly discarded

9340957 as measured by our purchasing power our quality of life has not kept up with the cost of living as a result our standard of living has and will continue to diminish we are falling further and further behind

9340959 every time we get a new order the work eventually moves to china as the project matures
9340960 the myth is that we are losing jobs because of chinas low wage rates but when you compare our wages and productivity rates with chinese wages and productivity rates the end result is not very far apart
9340961 the reason we are losing jobs to china is manufactures there have an 80 percent cost advantages because of currency manipulation and the fact that they rebate all taxes paid by manufacturers as an incentive to come there
9340962 the key to manufacturing is research and development if you can control the product life cycle and process you will get a much bigger piece of the pie including the manufacturing part of the operation

9340999 they donate and participate in all kinds of organizations i think this year alone were well over 50 000

9341002 theres nothing wrong with a contract most companies deal with contracts as they buy and sell things so theyre familiar with contracts

9341004 the prognosis i dont know but weve weathered some pretty bad storms before
9341005 but the educational establishment the media government mouthpieces institutional churches and nearly everyone else have mesmerized the working class into thinking that the rich deserve the wealth and income they have
9341006 of the growing frustration in this state as more and more people lose purchasing power or see their homes go into foreclosure or lose their jobs
9341007 they are happy there are wealthy people out there and they would like to become wealthy themselves
9341008 many in the legislature suffer from what i call the east berlin syndrome
9341009 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million but seriously
9341010 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
9341011 the income goes to the wealthy perhaps the taxes should as well
9341012 people are talking about the disparity of income the corporations that are out there that have gotten all these tax breaks and ceos and the income they are making which are just absurd
9341013 i think the american people and the residents of california are starting to see that
9341014 i used to keep it with my photos but now i keep it in my strongbox

9341016 to us james was the baby in the box for 40 years
9341017 we want to hear the details of how he was found hopefully this can provide him some closure
9341018 he runs back to the car and says mom theres a baby in the box
9341019 im sorry its just very hard for me to think about that
9341020 as soon as we walked in and said we just found an abandoned baby two nurses came running toward me and took him from me
9341021 i called the next day to ask about his condition but they wouldnt tell me because i wasnt family
9341022 as fast as we found you we lost you just as fast
9341023 james became a part of us the day we found him
9341024 they told me i already had too many kids i told them i had five children i told them that was ok it would be like throwing one more potato into the pot
9341025 who raised him how was he raised does he have a good life is he a father does he have a job
9341026 when we used to still live in manteca hed drive by the site and tell the kids thats where i found that baby hes been so excited
9341027 if it wasnt for gloria we wouldnt never have found james
9341028 we feel a segment of our membership will utilize the facility in the evenings
9341029 extending the hours will give opportunity to those who cannot attend during the day our membership age is 50 and up so for members who are still working or otherwise busy during the day there just isnt time to get involved if you close the doors at 5
9341030 extending the hours opens us up to a whole range of possibilities but we are not planning many scheduled activities to start with
9341031 that may come later but for now we want to get a feel for what our members want and hopefully we find they make use of these evening hours and occupy all areas of the building

9341043 the recruiting landscape and how one seeks a position in the last one or two years has changed dramatically
9341044 companies are inundated with r sum s because someone can apply with a click
9341045 i applied online and sent a cover letter and r sum
9341046 i care about what theyve done but i care more about what they can do for this company
9341047 we had someone here whos a dna researcher but just has trouble writing a cover letter
9341048 securing a job comes down to going face to face with an interviewer
9341049 go on the companys web site and read the about us section
9341050 learn about the company i dont care how nice your personality is if you cant do that youre out its an insult to the interviewer
9341051 dont go in to the interview wearing jeans and a t shirt
9341052 its scary to find yourself out there but it can be exhilarating
9341053 im at a crossroads i could go into marketing media or writing a good marketing job could mix all of them
9341054 im trying to prioritize my r sum and get six pages down to two im constantly looking to tailor it so i can send one thats most appropriate for the job im definitely not good at marketing myself that is a downside im only in my third week i can do this for a couple of months before i panic
9341055 if you dont use linkedin and facebook youre cutting out sources
9341056 now the candidate can vet the manager and company in a way they were not able to do before its more of a two way in this courting
9341057 to make their most grateful acknowledgments to their friends and customers for the many favours and civilities they have received and hope by this union they will be enabled to carry on their business to the entire satisfaction of their friends as on their part the strictest assiduity and attention shall be observed
9341058 those times we would just kind of wrap ourselves around her to keep her from harming herself
9341059 some of the 6 to 12 yearolds are on some pretty strange concoctions
9341060 we really hesitated about putting her on medication because we know its a hard thing for their little brains because theyre still developing
9341061 its not any different than my friend who uses an inhaler or my friend who must test her blood for sugar and take shots the meds all of us use makes it easier to be at school with our friends
9341062 it was getting abnormally physical to the point that would be abuse
9341063 we want to send a message that these pharmaceutical companies need to walk a straight line when theyre dealing with arkansas and other states because the health and safety of consumers across this country depend on that
9341064 the goal is to have a better understanding of whats going on and to sensitize our mentalhealth community to these issues
9341065 were two to three times more likely to prescribe antipsychotics to young children than florida and florida thinks they have a problem
9341066 you cant have a cookie cutter formula for these kids very often these are very difficult cases
9341067 this isnt just about drugs its really about appropriate mental health care for kids and adults
9341068 je pense que cette temp te sera le pire sc nario pour la r gion productrice dhydrocarbures
9341069 we always worked for it that was our goal but the reality of it coming together was so distant and all of a sudden out of nowhere comes this guy from chicago who put it together who made people look at him first as qualified before they looked at his skin color and thats fabulous
9341070 no i didnt believe it to be honest with you no i didnt i didnt think white america would allow it
9341071 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems
9341072 but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now
9341073 it was more partisan than i thought it would be
9341074 on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy sen mccain has been anything but independent he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong and when one of his chief advisers the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession and that weve become and i quote a nation of whiners a nation of whiners tell that to the proud auto workers at a michigan plant who after they found out it was closing kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty these are not whiners they work hard and give back and keep going without complaint these are the americans that i know now i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know

9341076 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order
9341077 requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured
9341078 everyone who gets care is effectively insured by some mechanism
9341079 less about obama and more about mccain but the contrast will be apparent
9341080 he will try to accomplish both goals reaching out to undecided voters while also reassuring the base
9341081 thats the art of leadership to be able to do seemingly contradictory things
9341082 knows exactly what the democrats are doing who their vice presidential candidate is what their convention message is
9341083 that will frankly after watching that for a few days help unify the republican party but i dont think it is a question of unifying the republican party
9341084 part of what people will be looking for is is he tuned in about their concerns about the economy jobs energy costs the costs of health care
9341085 sen mccain has already demonstrated that he is not a continuation of the bush agenda and approach on so many issues

9341135 the areas where you have deteriorating urban or suburban health are going to be flash points and are likely going to see high and rising taxes to offset decline combined with the same or even more services
9341136 given the way places have grown and developed in metropolitan areas in last 20 years most areas are actually precarious taxes will remain low for a while until they begin to spike
9341137 some of them do sewer inhouse and water in house and some dont
9341138 the bottom line is its not so much the amount people are paying its the bang for the buck what are they getting for what theyre paying
9341139 the largest share of property taxes is the school districts
9341140 ive never understood this concept of school districts and why we need them theyre basically independent governments
9341141 people would not be living in sloan if they were paying 6 800 in taxes
9341142 we have about a half dozen of those homes they were brand new builds
9341143 the pattern is very familiar and not a healthy one

9341153 i am very pleased to see hillary clinton do well tonight i will never vote for her personally but i used to know her personally
9341154 clinton will win the dem nominee regardless how many delegates obama has come convention the system was never designed to be fair
9341155 in my opinion obama just kicked hillary clintons ass on foreign policy on national tv
9341156 i dont know about the rest of undecided independent america but for me
9341157 let me make it clear i do not support either clinton or huckabee for president
9341158 first let me say im a registered independent in ny and i havent chosen a candidate other than biden and perhaps obama who needs a few years at the army war college the dem field disappoints this election
9341159 this is the clintons though and the clinton news network it was never going to be a fair fight the name of the game is entitlement the media is going to not ask about her campaign massive contributions from chinese busboys is not going to call her out on flip flopping and is not going to put her in another situation in a debate where she might have it tough

9341164 i always had a love for the arts so i pursued the field of graphic design in college
9341165 i received my b f a in commercial art computer design from millikin university a small private liberal arts college in illinois and worked as a graphic designer for a few years i quickly became quite technically savvy due to the fact that people sometimes think a graphic designer has the same knowledge base as an it person i am very grateful for this though because i have since learned a great deal about computers
9341166 in college i was trained on macs of course but my first computer was actually a pc because i couldnt afford a mac at the time after having two pcs the second one being a gift from my dad i finally splurged two years ago and got myself a macbook pro it is my pride and joy and sits with me on the sofa resting on my trusty ilap so i can surf and work while i watch tv in the evenings my dogs like this setup as well because the poor things were being ignored when i sat at my desk and surfed now i can browse through forum after forum researching all the many products that i am interested in while my dogs snooze quietly beside me

9341176 to help the abused person forgive leaders friends and family members can acknowledge the gravity of the offense allowing the innocent person to work through his or her anger and pain much abuse involves the denial of feelings and truth so people who have been abused need to be heard and have their feelings validated if they are to truly recover and regain self worth when the person who has been abused is pressured to forgive he or she may feel an added measure of guilt taking the blame not only for the abuse itself but also for being unable to forgive allowing the person time to forgive can be a lengthy process but it is critical to healing

9341308 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9341309 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9341310 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9341311 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9341312 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9341313 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9341314 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9341315 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9341316 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9341317 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9341318 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9341319 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9341320 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari
9341321 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9341322 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9341323 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9341324 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9341325 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9341326 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9341327 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale

9341338 in queste ultime settimane ha detto ratzinger al termine della recita dell angelus dal palazzo apostolico di castel gandolfo la cronaca ha registrato laumento degli episodi di immigrazione irregolare dallafrica
9341339 non di rado la traversata del mediterraneo verso il continente europeo visto come un approdo di speranza per sfuggire a situazioni avverse e spesso insostenibili si trasforma in tragedia quella avvenuta qualche giorno ha aggiunto il papa ricordando i recenti casi di sbarco di clandestini che hanno prodotto numerosi morti fa sembra aver superato le precedenti per lalto numero di vittime la migrazione fenomeno presente fin dagli albori della storia dellumanit che da sempre pertanto ha caratterizzato le relazioni tra popoli e nazioni
9341340 lemergenza in cui si trasformata nei nostri tempi tuttavia ci interpella e mentre sollecita la nostra solidariet impone nello stesso tempo efficaci risposte politiche so che molte istanze regionali nazionali e internazionali si stanno occupando della questione della migrazione irregolare ad esse va il mio plauso e il mio incoraggiamento affinch continuino la loro meritevole azione con senso di responsabilit e spirito umanitario
9341341 senso di responsabilit devono mostrare anche i paesi di origine non solo perch si tratta di loro concittadini ha aggiunto benedetto xvi ma anche per rimuovere le cause di migrazione irregolare come pure per stroncare alle radici tutte le forme di criminalit ad essa collegate dal canto loro i paesi europei e comunque quelli meta di immigrazione sono tra laltro chiamati a sviluppare di comune accordo iniziative e strutture sempre pi adeguate alle necessit dei migranti irregolari questi ultimi poi vanno pure sensibilizzati sul valore della propria vita che rappresenta un bene unico sempre prezioso da tutelare di fronte ai gravissimi rischi a cui si espongono nella ricerca di un miglioramento delle loro condizioni e sul dovere della legalit che si impone a tutti
9341342 come padre comune sento il profondo dovere di richiamare lattenzione di tutti sul problema e di chiedere la generosa collaborazione di singoli e di istituzioni per affrontarlo e trovare vie di soluzione il signore ha concluso benedetto xvi ci accompagni e renda fecondi i nostri sforzi

9341355 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9341356 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9341361 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9341362 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9341363 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9341364 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9341365 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica

9341396 when i started running in the hills 20 years ago near our small farm in the carmiel mountains in the north of the country people looked at me strangely a healthy sporty lifestyle wasnt so developed then now all the bike paths in the hills and mountains are full of riders many people are running all over the place and there are walkers everywhere now you see a culture of healthy living growing here even though were all consumed by the daily struggle to survive to make ends meet we as israelis still have a long way to go but there is definitely a development of a healthy lifestyle here
9341397 ive kept very fit all of my life out of necessity with me it became a way of life i needed to lead i needed to go down to the seashore and into the water and for this i had to stay extremely fit

9341470 me ha molestado que desde mayo mi padre y mi representante hayan intentado renovar mi contrato pero el club pensaba fichar a cristiano ronaldo y no ten a tantas ganas de renovarme
9341471 no fue una ni dos ni tres veces las que mi representante y mi padre fueron al club a renovar han ido m s de mil veces y el club tampoco se interes mucho por mi permanencia no tengo nada contra cristiano me parece un excelente jugador pero tengo mi valor y mi orgullo ahora como el club no ha conseguido fichar mi salida es un problema tengo mi orgullo y mi intenci n es salir
9341472 el problema es que el club no ha conseguido fichar a nadie
9341473 el club dijo que volvieran en septiembre cuando se cierran las negociaciones
9341474 antes pens que estar a diez a os pero no es posible y ahora tengo ganas de salir
9341475 el problema es que el club no ha conseguido fichar a nadie
9341476 quiero aclarar las cosas porque me llaman pesetero y no saben lo que ha pasado verdaderamente llegu al presidente con una propuesta del chelsea me dijo que si la propuesta era buena me dejar a salir estaba seguro de fichar a otro jugador pero ahora como estamos al final y no han fichado a nadie no quieren dejarme salir
9341477 la nica persona que no me est dejando salir es el entrenador

9341486 insensible realizar la convenci n cuando hay personas sufriendo en la costa del golfo
9341487 evidentemente la conducta de cada gobierno es lo que va a significar la forma en que estados unidos va a tratar a esos gobiernos
9341488 como hay un conocimiento por parte del senador mccain sobre las realidades del hemisferio por el continente americano sin duda eso va a conllevar a una relaci n m s estrecha con nuestros amigos como m xico como colombia como chile per los otros gobiernos muy amigos que tiene estados unidos
9341489 est consciente que tenemos enemigos en este hemisferio y esa es otra diferencia con el candidato dem crata a la presidencia barack obama
9341490 hay una diferencia entre rusia y georgia hay una diferencia entre ch vez y el presidente colombiano lvaro uribe mccain conoce esas diferencias obama evidentemente no
9341491 mccain est consciente de que ch vez es una amenaza para todo el hemisferio que ch vez est financiando elementos desestabilizadores a trav s de todo el hemisferio hay que contrarrestar los esfuerzos de ch vez por desestabilizar las democracias en el hemisferio a trav s de la utilizaci n del poder econ mico que tiene por el petr leo
9341492 gran parte del problema que tenemos con bolivia y ecuador es esa utilizaci n por parte del se or ch vez de los recursos de venezuela para ir incrementando su influencia y su agenda antiamericana
9341493 es muy preocupante lo que estamos viendo en esos pa ses
9341494 habr a a n m s inter s por parte del presidente de estados unidos sobre el tema cubano sobre la necesidad de ayudar a la oposici n interna y a la sociedad civil

9341496 legalizaci n de todos los partidos la prensa y los sindicatos obreros
9341497 porque mccain considera que es irrespetuoso la forma en que el se or obama y el congreso dem crata han tratado a colombia
9341498 es irrespetuoso tratar a m xico dici ndole que ahora hay que renegociar el acuerdo de libre comercio con nuestro vecino m s cercano
9341499 es una decisi n el cambio del jefe militar que corresponde evidentemente a la secretar a de la defensa y habr valorado muchas cosas

9341503 meanwhile the springboks win over the wallabies in the tri nations has been labelled a farce by a respected rugby journalist
9341504 one day we are going to get it together and when we do some team is going to get a hiding
9341505 we decided not to commit too many players to rucks when it mattered most
9341506 however de villiers said here on thursday it was the execution not the plan that needed attention
9341507 if you look at the way the all blacks committed too many players to the breakdown points last weekend i think were are on the right road
9341508 it gave the wallabies the opportunity to take the ball wide because there were not enough opponents to stop them
9341509 least of all a very fair and even handed ref who did not kill us every time we went to ground
9341510 the only difference is that they didnt lose the ball sa could have played the same game they did yesterday and lost
9341511 eccentric springboks coach peter de villiers hit back at his critics following his sides record win over the wallabies claiming they are unpatriotic and comparing his plight to that of jesus christ
9341512 think of carel du plessiss 1997 61 22 win against the wallabies in pretoria or nick malletts 52 10 win against france in paris or a number of the wins under jake white en route to the 2007 world cup those wins like saturdays were achieved through playing sensible rugby that if played with enough precision power and dominance usually gets described as sensational rugby
9341513 if they can become patriotic and believe in whats happening in south africa and not look for their honey outside of the borders and offer support rather than stomping on people who gave them hours and hours of joy last year and this year we as a nation will grow much better
9341514 we didnt go out there to show them that they were wrong we went out there to exactly showcase our talents and the belief that we do have in ourselves
9341515 the same people who threw their robes on the ground when jesus rode on a donkey were the same people who crowned him and hit him with sticks and stuff like that and were the same people who said afterwards how we shouldnt have done that hes the son of god
9341516 one of the last outposts of the bygone british empire still breeding their colonialist keep it white hopes alive
9341517 we made some definite tactical mistakes both in perth and in cape town and we compounded them in durban
9341518 the aussies havent thought this one through this law and this one alone is madness and the sooner it is ditched the better
9341519 its been like when you touch a flame and get burnt you dont generally go back there hopefully what we do from here is critical
9341520 you cant fix these things with words and thats the reality of the experience we have just been through
9341521 these boys are feeling it and if that serves us well then thats good
9341522 at the moment everyone is still absorbing the defeat as we should be everyone is disappointed
9341523 but we get a good opportunity to go home have a bit of a break re group for what will be a massive opportunity and big challenge and one we hope well be up for
9341524 its been a good tour in every way bar the last half dozen hours
9341525 we will get home catch up with family and friends and get some downtime recharge
9341526 when the boys have recharged the brains will start ticking over and theyll start thinking about what can be done
9341527 then well gather and well push on and put some of those thoughts into action
9341528 the tri nations isnt over both sides are capable of winning it
9341529 its a one off encounter now and in one game both sides can make their season good
9341530 they were committing to the breakdown ball they were competing through every phase and facet like they hardly did before

9341573 i said to walt this cant be happening because his advance team didnt come to alaska to check her out
9341574 were not a very big state people i talk to would have heard something
9341575 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9341576 it seems like theyre getting out in front of things this time
9341577 i signed up for the emails from the mccain campaign i wanted to see what kind of stuff they are sending to their supporters they have the same basic set up as obama a site with some social networking features etc
9341578 i think were of the same mind on that one the most we can hope for is a few bones as you say health care a tax cut on the middle class maybe some reform and protection of public education etc

9341607 in calton between 50 and 60 of the working age population are economically inactive it is easier to park people on long term benefits than it is to find the energy and creativity to help them move from dependence to independence

9341617 garbage typically hasnt been called an economic indicator but we firmly believe it is
9341618 solid waste production goes up and down with the economy
9341619 we see our own garbage and we think thats what fills up landfills
9341620 but a big chunk of landfills is construction debris its not so much that were buying fewer 2 liter soda bottles its less construction going on
9341621 dont represent that big of a piece to account for the kinds of fluctuations were seeing in the amounts going into the landfills
9341622 we have seen in the past that with downturns in the economy disposal tonnage reduces

9341626 this isnt the ace of spades hq i thought i knew
9341627 the age of consent is 16 in virginia so that means if i start talking about the
9341628 dude this is not a secure line these conversations of ours are ruining any shot of me running for elected office
9341629 the age of consent is 16 in virginia so that means
9341630 hey senator mccain theres someone on line 2 who claims that hes the french minister of defense and hes using a makes quotation signs in the air with his fingers time machine to call you from 1939 he thinks that sarah palin is the worst choice you could have made but im not sure who he thinks you should have picked he keeps mumbling something about some maginot dude didnt we vet him back in april
9341631 on a related subject if kos wants to continue slandering sarah and their kids with this baby nonsense he had better start worrying about where todd palin is at and whether any rifles are missing from his gun rack
9341632 i havent been this unhappy since my last blow job
9341633 the age of consent is 16 in virginia so that means
9341634 the age of consent is 16 in virginia so that means
9341635 the great threat to the obama biden ticket can be captured in one word authenticity
9341636 liberals love obama because he is a numinous negro conservatives love palin because she has a downs baby and an m 16
9341637 maybe if we call them inbred racist rednecks some more theyll come around
9341638 the age of consent is 16 in virginia so that means
9341639 the new ordinance is yet another attempt to circumvent the courts prior rulings and further an agenda that runs afoul of the united states constitution
9341640 the age of consent is 16 in virginia so that means
9341641 la d faite peut se r v ler une d licieuse attente quand on sait comment pr parer sa revanche

9341644 i think maybe having five days off had more to do with it than anything
9341645 but i felt i made some pitches when i needed to and i kept us in the game
9341646 the most important thing at this point in the season is to continue to find ways to play well youve got to play tough every day were doing that right now
9341647 i didnt throw strikes and when i did they hit them
9341648 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9341649 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9341650 im afraid chris that we may have to look at that situation and well try and monitor it ive been talking to governors jindal la barbour miss riley ala crist fla ive been talking to all of them
9341651 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9341652 i dont know what rules of engagement are but you may safely assumer its going to be a weapons free situation
9341653 hmmmm looks like we have to uproot and start again well stay together and well look at it as an adventure so whadya say folks alaska cali hawaii nebraska what about texas
9341654 my only point is that commander of the alaska national guard sounds defensive and lame
9341655 power abstracted desires that the president should be able to call up an individual states national guard without the approval of the governor of that state
9341656 the age of consent is 16 in virginia so that means
9341657 it was rightly noted in denver that hillary made 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9341658 it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9341659 the gender gap traditionally has been determined by party preference not by the gender of the candidate
9341660 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9341661 it is so good to be here in steeler country
9341662 stop wasteful spending cut property taxes and put the people first
9341663 this is going to come down to how she performs
9341664 has never publicly demonstrated the kind of interest much less expertise in federal issues and foreign affairs that should mark a candidate for the second highest office in the land
9341665 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9341666 voters in these areas are much more conservative on social issues
9341667 we have received numerous requests for assistance from local parish shelters and other animal welfare organizations in louisiana
9341668 we are working closely with the louisiana state animal response team to assist and provide resources
9341669 we are pleased to be able to lend our assistance both in terms of human resources and equipment in disaster relief efforts
9341670 by using our resources strategically and making key connections at the local levels the aspcas disaster response team is able to effectively respond to shelters and animals in need
9341671 she comes off like a real oil patch kind of alaskan
9341672 at least she can shoot better than dick cheney i can tell you that for a fact
9341673 in a national forum that might be a little difficult to appreciate but shes a woman who doesnt back down
9341674 our governor is going to be vice president and we still dont have an olive garden
9341675 it shows the best thing about alaska which is that if you have any skill at all you can rise up
9341676 she is a strong woman who can wear a skirt and be proud of it
9341677 can you imagine having the mayor of wasilla as the vice president
9341678 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9341679 they have soy toilet cleaner we dont have that in england were so uncivilised
9341680 this is still a big ugly storm still strong and i encourage everyone to leave
9341681 i cant take a chance because so many people died in katrina
9341682 i was here for katrina and i was going to stay but this ones coming really bad and i decided to get out
9341683 the wind looks to be stronger this time im scared it will rip the roof off
9341684 it remains likely that gustav will prove to become a worse case scenario for the producing region and places the heart of the oil production region under a high risk of sustaining significant or major damage
9341685 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9341686 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9341687 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9341688 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9341689 russias commitment to a relationship of understanding and cooperation with the rest of europe is in doubt
9341690 its up to russia today to make a fundamental choice
9341691 to assume a presence on the ground in support of all efforts toward a peaceful and lasting solution to conflicts in georgia
9341692 russia may pretend with its petro power and wealth to be immune from any actions by the west but beyond the short term it is vulnerable
9341693 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9341694 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9341695 this has to be the biggest blunder since harriet miers
9341696 you always want to contribute and sometimes regardless if you win or lose just going out there and throwing quality innings up there gives your team a chance
9341697 for whatever reason thats where the streak has come from
9341698 he was changing speeds spotting the ball well on the attack hes throwing good
9341699 any time youre going to have success its going to be because you got good starting pitching and your defense is good
9341700 any time youre part of something thats a first especially since im a big brewers fanatic now its an honor to have that title
9341701 hes done a phenomenal job all year and youve got to figure that at some point hes going to hit a bump in the road because everyone does
9341702 when you throw the ball down the middle i dont care who youre playing its not going to get major league hitters out
9341703 for the first few innings every time i tried to pitch inside it was right down the middle camerons home run was right down the middle sure theyre a good hitting team but when you throw pathetic pitches it really doesnt work

9341715 the new mapping system has been a valuable tool for the revenue department
9341716 it is also an asset for real estate agents attorneys title workers court personnel sheriffs department staff and many citizens just doing research within or outside of the county

9341927 that the county and towns leesburg and purcellville in particular were able to work together on making the eventually approved plan something that everybody was ready and interested in implementing the hope was that it not become a shelf plan and the county not develop it
9341928 way ahead of where other towns are because of the jewel we have of the w amp od trail
9341929 jo jedanput estitam na oj bra i u abhaziji i ju noj osetiji
9341930 predsjednik i potpredsjednik odlu ili su ne oti i u minnesotu zbog uragana
9341931 ovo mora prestati ali ne u poduzeti ni ta to bi moglo stvoriti lo e ozra je progla enje izvanrednog stanja stvorilo bi lo e ozra je u zemlji i svijetu
9341932 mediji su o ekivali da nakon audijencije kod kralja podnesem ostavku
9341933 rekao sam vam i prije da ne u podnijeti ostavku ostajem da bih upravljao ovom zemljom
9341934 when the grant period comes up this spring well be ready to go full force on that
9341935 we are joining forces and trying to pursue those things thats the plan
9341936 my traffic pedestrian specialist thats going to be his focus this whole year
9341937 well look at homes close to the school and we just need to build a sidewalk or put in a crosswalk
9341938 itll be where we could get the biggest bang for our buck with the grant money
9341939 we do divvy up what money were giving to transportation
9341940 this is important enough that i would be willing to lobby for that
9341941 we have to look at areas that are really going to be effective
9341942 were going to try and get all the parties together and try and come up with a game plan to proceed i would hate to spend all this money and not have any impact
9341943 anything we can do to get cars off the road or get children safely to school is a plus and we need to be pursuing that
9341944 the other side of safe routes to school is bottom line you have to educate and talk the parents in to letting their kids walk
9341945 i think its kind of a two edged sword generally if the feeling in the community is that they are afraid of their kids being alone out on some of these areas theyre still going to drive or ask for bus routes
9341946 i think our principals often encourage parents to avail themselves of the safe walk zones or the bus routes
9341947 we always need to make parents aware of what exists and encourage them to take advantage of this
9341948 if we look at school actions see where we could apply for some improvements then maybe take it to the pta meetings if its received well that gives us a sign that it is something we should pursue
9341949 if i remember correctly a group of leesburg parents asked to become a walking community they explored the state grants and had a plan in place and robert dupree and his puppets shot the plan down as being just plain stupid
9341950 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9341951 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9341952 parents need a place where they feel comfortable for their children to play
9341953 we will help develop programs so that the school district and us too gymnastics will have a facility to use
9341954 i knew i was opening up at a time that business wasnt going to be too good
9341955 but i knew i had to keep my overhead down and advertise to bring my clientele to my store
9341956 the ups i never noticed too much and the downs kind of kicked me in the pants
9341957 i feel like right at this moment i need to get a job
9341958 when you think about all those mortgage guys driving around in their lamborghinis and spending money hand over fist driving up the local economy what everybodys got to understand is that the weirdness was when those guys were making that kind of money not whats happening now
9341959 had the two most highly educated workforces in california both had a venture capital structure that was going to recover and neither had their forward looking industries devastated
9341960 orange county is still a great place to live and work and so is silicon valley
9341961 for those who can get through this cycle the population will continue to prosper and grow
9341962 if the banks arent lending money nobodys going to be taking out their refis and fixing up their homes
9341963 but some people know theyre going to stay and they have the money so they do it anyway and they know to do it now because nows a down market
9341964 the local quintets occasionally blissful wall of noise approach isnt just a nod to the halcyon days of 90s shoegaze instead they lead us back to the hazy oblivion of midsummer with bittersweet arrangements that incorporate retro organ tones and reverb heavy early morning vocals that have as much in common with psyched out folk rock as they do with dream pop pair that with a gorgeous cohesiveness that runs like a vaguely defined narrative throughout and the result is a deeply reflective work that gently coos
9341965 business boomed and i had to move to a professional confectionary kitchen to fulfill orders
9341966 how many dumps did i have to take today i took a lot of dumps today
9341967 i hired a campaign manager to win the servant towel award people like that dont deserve to win it
9341968 however in hindsight i think it might have been better to have told him in front of john macarthur so that dad would just say grace to you
9341969 he told me look we wont be remembering this at your thirtieth wedding anniversary
9341970 of course i start to breathe after somebody passed gas

9341989 being older and still single makes you more single more single than say katie mohler

9342162 deep wounds caused by italian colonisation to the people of libya
9342163 the accord will provide for 200 million a year over the next 25 years through investments in infrastructure projects in libya
9342164 this agreement should put an end to 40 years of discord it is a concrete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9342165 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans

9342171 asif ali zardari the leading contender for the presidency of nuclear armed pakistan was suffering from severe psychiatric problems as recently as last year according to court documents filed by his doctors
9342172 it would be very difficult to say that there is nothing in the files that shows there was possible corruption going on after what i have seen in there after i heard what the general prosecutor said i have a feeling we are talking about two different cases
9342173 the sad thing is that musharraf was the best of the current lot
9342174 even by the notoriously low standards of south asian politics asif ali zardari leader of the ppp is a compromised figure dogged by corruption charges so it is hard to be enthused by the ppps decision to nominate its leader as the countrys next president

9342177 he is of unsound mind and has been so declared by a competent court
9342178 it would be unwise to dismiss the recent revelations about the fragile state of mr asif zardaris mental health as irrelevant
9342179 does the country really need another potentially deluded individual to lead it through these troubled times
9342180 it would be very difficult to say that there is nothing in the files that shows there was possible corruption going on after what i have seen in there after i heard what the general prosecutor said i have a feeling we are talking about two different cases

9342189 a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out whats going on is fine
9342190 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job
9342191 im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue were going to try to stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9342192 i will not be going to minnesota for the republican national convention said bush who instead will travel to texas on monday to coordinate government efforts he will travel to san antonio where state and federal officials are pre positioning relief material
9342193 i will not be traveling to louisiana tomorrow bush said
9342194 have taken the storm very seriously and are working very proactively

9342202 in this party we have other values that matter to us we talk about respecting everybodys faith
9342203 therefore unless one is willing to compromise ones beliefs by agreeing to a religious service it is impossible to be buried
9342204 there is a degree of black comedy about this and my mother who had a fantastic sense of humour would certainly have laughed
9342205 when i rang up and asked derry city councils cemeteries department if it was possible to bury an atheist in a municipal cemetery they said it was possible because there were different sections for catholics protestants and muslims

9342216 maka dengan nama allah yang maha pemurah dan mengasihi saya memasyhurkan dan mengisytiharkan bagi pihak umat persekutuan tanah melayu bahawa 31 ogos 1957 persekutuan tanah melayu akan kekal menjadi sebuah negara demokrasi yang merdeka dan berdaulat serta berdasarkan kepada kebebasan dan keadilan dan sentiasa mengutamakan kesejahteraan dan kesetiaan rakyat
9342217 sebenarnya keseluruhan perlembagaan persekutuan perlu diperkasakan dan bukannya hanya setakat fasal 152 153 sahaja kerana jika langkah konkrit tidak dilakukan perlembagaan kita akan jadi seperti perhiasan atau kosmetik sahaja
9342218 saya difahamkan pada masa ini tiada badan khusus sama ada peringkat kementerian atau negeri yang melaksanakannya dan ini adalah antara punca berlakunya keciciran di kalangan melayu sendiri dan wujudnya pihak tertentu yang mempertikaikan intipatinya
9342219 adakah kita mahukan sebuah masyarakat seperti singapura atau masyarakat mempunyai pelbagai bahasa rasmi agama islam diletakkan pada kedudukan sama dengan agama lain adakah kita sanggup terima semua ini
9342220 melayu bukannya tuntut hak lain cuma kita pertahankan hak sedia ada yang telah dipersetujui dan termaktub dalam perlembagaan tetapi apabila kita perjuangkan hak ini seolah olah seperti kita pula yang bersalah
9342221 maka pernahkah kamu melihat orang yang menjadikan hawa nafsunya sebagai tuhannya dan allah membiarkannya sesat berdasarkan ilmu nya

9342239 it appears to a casual observer that memphis has a poor mans brent schaeffer
9342240 i dont understand why they dont just give will hudgens the nod i thought he was pretty good
9342241 im not worried about memphis running game based solely on our linebacking corps our linebackers are built to stop elusive backs in the spread our starting outside linebackers are converted safeties their speed and agility is uncommon for that of linebackers and their coverage skills are pretty good too see ashlee palmer leading the team in ints last year jonathan cornell is also noticeably faster than any linebacker other than palmer that saw any time last year i just dont see them having a problem with the memphis running backs
9342242 if memphis passing game is going to work at all theyre going to have to give it to their wide receivers close to the line of scrimmage and let those playmakers work
9342243 still i find myself wondering how much it will hurt us that there is a seven inch height difference when memphis throws bubble screens all day height doesnt seem to have any impact on your ability to step back and turn to the quarterback if they do that all game again this year i will be officially convinced that tommy west is a bad coach they should use their mismatch more effectively
9342244 memphis defensive line is nothing at which to laugh mills and brown are the starting defensive ends on a memphis squad that will rely heavily on getting to the passer before he can exploit their secondary their starting dts are freddie barnett and clinton mcdonald i hope we run right at those guys
9342245 at linebacker memphis has several more injuries like we apparently dont memphis didnt have depth then they lost a starter its rough at that position for them
9342246 in the secondary memphis has significant trouble like us they cant defend people through the air i hope jevan can exploit that well we need to get the ball in the hands of mike wallace dexter and shay
9342247 in closing i expect us to beat them though im sure singleton and calhoun will give us trouble
9342248 think im walking stiffly yeah theres a 120 pound actress on my back

9342336 these centers are for the probationers who are more at risk of being incarcerated
9342337 most of those who are sent to the centers have issues with substance abuse
9342338 because the counties do have these services judges will often deviate downward on a sentence to keep them in the community
9342339 we believe in locking up those were afraid of but not those were mad at if theres a chance we can safely release them

9342357 quando una ragazza si mette in gioco le regole le decide lei
9342358 weve seen that being tough on crime can be very expensive
9342359 we have to look at how we can be smarter in our approach to crime and punishment
9342360 we just built hard walls we didnt build drug treatment centers and mental health centers to reach out to those people who arent violent and can be rehabilitated
9342361 we could be shifting money to areas that we know are critical such as mental health education and health care for the poor
9342362 this is something the citizens expect us to look at before we raise taxes
9342363 if its true that our best intended legislation has worked against us then we need to make a change
9342364 the trend among the states is to find other options than prison for drug offenders and low level property felons who are not a great risk of creating a violent offense
9342365 theyre looking at things like shorter sentences and more community based supervision for drug offenders theyre mandating residential drug treatment research is more than sound on the matter that community treatment works
9342366 nevada has one of the worst social safety nets in the country
9342367 we dont provide adequate services for mental health or substance abuse which are the main reasons people commit crimes and go to prison
9342368 when people get out of prison they often have nowhere to go so we have to make sure that during this transitional period that they have a place to live they can make new acquaintances get a job and a fresh start otherwise were setting up people to fail
9342369 we just have a lot of ground to make up
9342370 i dont want to find nevada in californias situation where the courts are involved because of overcrowding
9342371 i have a responsibility to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and inmates i cant do that if we begin cramming inmates into facilities without more space
9342372 i have 198 officers and i could use 260 if you look at my facility theyre packing em in
9342373 people have to work real hard in the state of nevada to land in prison
9342374 we dont send first time offenders to prison and often we dont send second or third time offenders unless they commit a heinous crime the legislature will have to make a difficult policy decision in 2009
9342375 do they fund additional space or reduce the prison population if they reduce the prison population theres a substantial risk crime will go up
9342376 is that what the legislature intended or were these sentences intended for the guy who paid the driver 150
9342377 nevada should establish non incarceration intermediate sanctions for offenders so parole and probation can better manage technical violators in the community without returning them to prison
9342378 nevada currently has no community based facilities to handle technical violators or those who might benefit from some level of supervision but not full prison incarceration every other state in america has facilities of this kind and nevada would also benefit from these cost effective options
9342379 were very much on the same page as that 2002 report
9342380 the real question is whether anybody is going to listen at the legislature
9342381 my fear and apprehension is the commission will take a myopic and narrow viewpoint
9342382 no sportsmen i know right now will vote for him again
9342383 unfortunately he went with one special interest group who he feels represents sportsmen but they dont
9342384 may be the finest biologist nevada has ever produced to replace him with a childhood buddy who has made incredibly inflammatory statements over the years is unconscionable
9342385 the individuals the governor has appointed to the wildlife commission have called our professional biologists liars incompetent made terrible personal attacks on them
9342386 to see those same people in charge of policy is extremely disconcerting
9342387 if you dont appoint some people of course theyre going to be upset
9342388 it was a desire to have additional people on which is his prerogative
9342389 i think anyone saying that the commission is going to do certain things move in certain directions thats speculation at this point lets see how it goes
9342390 i speak not only for myself but thousands of sportsmen who are not pleased with the way ndow has been run
9342391 theyre the no 1 moneymaker for the department of wildlife
9342392 knocking predators over the head to get more mule deer
9342393 for the past few years the favorite greenie buzzword has been biodiversity in laymans terms it means spending sportsmens money on tweety birds lizards guppies and hundreds of other nongame creatures the sheep deer elk and duck clubs and other organizations claiming to represent sportsmen are not going to help in this fight they only do feel good things which doesnt include fighting for hunters
9342394 nevada hunters association and hunters alert truly represent sportsmen and have initiated solutions to the serious predator problems in our state when nobody else would try

9342407 i want to get my act together im not a violent offender i dont go off robbing people im not a mass murderer or a child pornographer
9342408 i would have taken it more seriously because i didnt want to come back here
9342409 but they just put me on a back burner and i took it like that i didnt know that getting caught with marijuana was going to send me back to prison
9342410 after he is out of prison he will most likely be sent back to mexico
9342411 he had mitigating circumstances because of the sexual abuse the fact that he tried to get help before the relapse and because its a nonviolent crime and a first time offense his wife is from here and his kids were born here but now his family is gone its shattered he has lost any chance of having a united family in the united states
9342412 if it were up to me i would have ordered him into a drug treatment program were just paying for his prison time before we deport him
9342413 we all take ownership of our respective wards the last thing i want to do is bring a contentious item before the council if it couldve been worked out at a neighborhood meeting

9342452 i was appalled at how flimsy the case is i was also appalled at the behaviour of many of those who helped produce the ipcc reports and by many of those who promote it
9342453 in particular i am referring to the arrogance the activities aimed at shutting down debate the outright fabrications the mindless defense of bogus science and the politicisation of the ipcc process and the science process itself

9342466 this industry is regulated you have to be a responsible citizen and if you dont youre going to have to pay the consequences
9342467 the dietary supplement industry has to be truthful and not misleading
9342468 if you dont follow that you shouldnt be in the industry we all have to play by the rules
9342469 it is unfortunate that so many consumers were deceived by the false advertising of this product and further manipulated through their credit card transactions
9342470 however its important to remember that this is just one isolated incident the majority of dietary supplement manufacturers are walking the straight and narrow when it comes to their advertising under the law dietary supplements must be able to substantiate their advertising claims if they cannot backup their claims there are severe penalties as evidenced by this case
9342471 crn will continue to support initiatives such as these so that consumers can be confident in the claims of dietary supplements after all without consumers confidence in our products we would not have an industry
9342472 this case was more about the companys marketing practices than about the claims being made for the product
9342473 the unfortunate part is that this case tends to reinforce the public perception that supplements are hocus pocus
9342474 as labor day approaches i am honored by the endorsement of the wisconsin state afl cio along with its 1 000 affiliated unions labor groups such as these have been vital in the creation of our middle class and the quality of life now enjoyed by many of our citizens we need to make sure that the working men and women of this state are paid livable wages have job security and can afford good healthcare for their families

9342576 seventy one percent of respondents said that they would vote yes on the november ballot measure which would replace criminal penalties for the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana with a civil fine of no more than 100
9342577 one of our biggest complaints was marijuana regulations were confusing

9342595 siden jeg begynte danse i buenos aires hadde jeg en viss forventning til hvordan tango utenfor argentina ville v re denne festivalen oppfylte nesten alle disse forventningene et vakkert lokale bra organisering hyggelige mennesker som tydelig hadde det fint p dansegulvet som jo er det viktigste selvsagt forventet jeg ikke at dette skulle v re et annet buenos aires hvor kodene er s strenge men her er folk mer pne og underholder seg med tango det er det viktige
9342596 ja selv om det er vanskelig s skal jeg l re det b de det f lge og alt det andre som mangler det bytte roller hvis man gj r det bra s gir det smidighet til dansen det er vanskelig gj re det men de som t r og behersker det sier det er veldig nyttig
9342597 det dreier seg om smak og bekvemmelighet det finnes kanskje noen som lider av homofobi med utgangspunkt i tango m man kanskje forvente at det finnes slike holdninger men folk som interesserer seg for begge rollene vil i dag av og til danse p gay milongaer i buenos aires avhenger dette ogs av hvilket m l du har med tangoen hobby eller jobb mange av de gode mannlige danserne som jobber med tango vil selvsagt bytte p rollene
9342598 jeg mener man her m ha et mer pent sinn noe tango tradisjonelt ikke er dessuten vil tango for de fleste selv om de danser med begge kj nn alltid gi en annen sensasjon n r man danser med en person av det kj nnet man er tiltrukket av dette gjelder jo b de heteroseksuelle og homoseksuelle nettopp derfor er det s fint med tangoqueer hvor det er like naturlig danse med personer av motsatt som av samme kj nn n r man danser tango s ker man tross alt gleden ved danse med en annen person

9342829 we hunt as much as we can and im proud to say our freezer is full of wild game we harvested here in alaska
9342830 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland
9342831 but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
9342832 always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures
9342833 the lines are being more clearly drawn on the gun issue
9342834 one day after senator obama made it clear that he thinks assault weapons should be banned in a remarkable portion of his speech here senator mccain selects someone who is not only proud to be endorsed by the nra an opponent of that ban but apparently is pretty enthusiastic about the guns themselves
9342835 of course we want to keep any firearm out of the hands of gang members and felons and drug dealers
9342836 but there is no way that senator obama can make a claim to be a supporter of the second amendment based on his voting record governor palin understands the values of the american public on these types of issues
9342837 palin is on a massive extermination program for wolves across large swaths of alaska to artificially inflate caribou and moose populations to pacify trophy hunters
9342838 its totally illogical its extreme its the draconian manipulation of bears and wolves in alaska

9342926 cashman has tried to build from within and hold down payroll you know act like a real gm but the yankees farm system still isnt producing quality position players and the futures of their best young pitchers remain uncertain so the yankees are ready to plunge back into the market signing free agents to excessive contracts forfeiting high draft picks does cashman want to lose his hard earned authority and revert back to being the donald trump of general managers buying every property in sight probably not but he has never been with any other organization and enjoys living in new york call him a glutton for punishment but it would be a shocker if he left on his own

9342996 the changchun players are basically those who helped the team win last years title

9342998 it was such a tough game we didnt play as well as we would have hoped and so we had many problems
9342999 valencia will fly on sunday from manchester to quito he is arriving at eight oclock on monday morning
9343000 i will speak to artur see how he feels and we will analyse it from there
9343001 i thought it was a good game but we dealt with their aerial threat and there was a minimum of chances
9343002 i felt comfortable and was looking forward to the second half
9343003 but through some bizarre goals and an excellent strike we found ourselves in a position which was difficult to claw back
9343004 if i was displeased i would tell the players first we will look at the game again on monday
9343005 in two out of three previous seasons we have lost the first old firm game and gone on to win the title so we can do it but it needs to be a great effort again
9343006 i spoke to roque after the end of the match and he told me his heel hurts a lot its a knock on the left heel
9343007 however well be able to make a clearer decision when he comes here on monday
9343008 the player must attend the national team training because this is how the system works here
9343009 i also talked to the blackburn doctor to tell him we will not risk roque well let them know all the details

9343011 elite xc creates a new weight class for diaz because he beat gomi giving diaz a belt and creating a weight division 160 he can make will make your belt legit sorry to ruin elite xcs plans and beat him
9343012 elite xc never promoted or took care of me as their champion
9343013 you are scared because diaz despite having a terrible showing last time was stopped by cuts
9343014 god forbid the doctor that let the fight continue against gomi had been calling the shots at your fight in your heart you know what would have happened and you would rather live the lie of being a paper champion
9343015 honor my contract elite xc wants to talk about honoring the contract how about when elite xc honored the contract and my pay to fight edson berto went down after i lost my first fight that was not part of my contract or how about the contract gary shaw breached by not promoting my boxing career gary shaw only gave me one out of four of the agreed upon fights i have not boxed for over a year when i signed with elite xc i was promised they would promote both my boxing and mma careers i could have signed with another mma only company but i wanted to box too
9343016 elite xc does me a favor after i lose by putting me on the first shoxc against edson berto
9343017 elite xc does me a favor after i lose by putting me on the first shoxc against edson berto bertos father is good friends with jareds father gary shaw who wants bertos brother on a boxing contract berto was the next guy elite xc wanted to build but i win that fight and now i am 1 1 elite xc gives me an opportunity to fight diaz elite xc puts me against diaz because elite xcs roster was so light and there was nobody else to fight him elite xc creates a new weight class for diaz because he beat gomi giving diaz a belt and creating a weight division 160 he can make will make your belt legit sorry to ruin elite xcs plans and beat him elite xc never promoted or took care of me as their champion
9343018 in the elite xcs dvd where diaz and i fought there are two 2 baseball cards of diaz and kimbo hello i won the fight and elite xcs promoting diaz after i beat him or how about the day elite xc flew diaz in to do a signing on the dvd where he lost wow that must have been uncomfortable nick signing a dvd and it is a fight that you lost why wasnt i flown in for the signing elite xc has never promoted me on either of their websites elitexc or pro elite elite xc offered me a fight on the first cbs show but only if i signed a new long term contract instead of promoting their best fighters on cbs you have to be on a long term contract for them to promote you that was not our deal
9343019 consider when elite xc gives a couple thousand tickets away at their cbs show in stockton elite xc gives me a hard time about comping me one extra ticket for my cousin that helped me train for my fight i only get four tickets per show i am the main event in honolulu my home town i did not ask for any tickets for my family and friends and they gave me a hard time about one extra ticket or how about when elite xc brought diaz into the ring after my last victory in hawaii to disrespect me and my family
9343020 chuck champion president elite xc threatens me my family and my manager with lawsuits and how hes going to sue me haha pretty hard to sue a guy who does not make jack with your company im glad kala disclosed how much i make which breached the confidentiality clause of the contract i will break down the real numbers for you i am the defending world champ i have been the main event for elite xc three out of four times on showtime in almost two years i have made approximately 83 000 after paying my trainers and managers fee i have 50 000 thousand after taxes probably 30 grand divide that by two years for 15 000 thousand a year divide by 52 weeks that amounts to approximately 300 a week i do not know anybody that can survive on that amount of money my buddies make more money than that in a couple days being a bus boy or bar back and yes you can argue i should fight more elite xc doesnt give me fights or promote me they ice me gary shaw productions only gave me one of the agreed upon four fights per the boxing contract and i do not want to ramble on about all the little small stuff that i can keep going on about but the straw that broke the camels back is they want me to fight diaz for the second time diaz is not the number one contender and they are paying diaz three times more money than me diaz complained after the stockton fight he was not paid enough how do you think that made me feel yes you can argue that diaz gets more for the draw therefore i do not deserve as much compensation if that is the case it is a result of elite xc terrible job promoting me instead of promoting me as their champ and upcoming athlete elite xc has resented me for ruining their plans to make diaz their champ that is just total disrespect so it comes down to money and what is fair i am tired of being bent over by elite xc with no vaseline
9343021 i am right when i say diaz is not the number one contender elite xc is trying to force this fight for their ratings eddie alaverez is the number one contender and anybody with half a brain knows that a fight with eddie is a way harder fight for me than diaz i will fight diaz but elite has to be fair im not ducking diaz why the hell would i be scared of someone i already beat with that being said i am going to focus on my boxing career i can make more money doing 6 and 8 rounders every other month and make more than i did being the elite xc defending world champ at least i will be able to sleep at night and be able to look myself in the mirror everyday that right there is worth more than 300 bucks a week or fighting a guy i cannot stand for less money than him the second time around will the diaz fight happen yes will the fight happen on elite xc on october 4 2008 probably not the way things are being run by chuck champion a guy whose history is newspapers not fighting and kala someone who talks a lot of game but has never put on a pair of gloves never stepped in a ring or cage kala has had everything handed to him with a silver spoon from daddy does anyone else but me think kala just wants to be famous and stir up all this dirty laundry i guess any publicity is good publicity when i think about it it has been good promotion for their october card since nobody is talking about it until you bring up the noons vs diaz match up

9343041 hes the most awkward fighter in all of mixed martial arts and hes a legend for what hes done in the ufc and for the sport because of how popular he is
9343042 if its a popularity contest hell have the fight hands down too bad his hands cant vote in and say who should win
9343043 i watched the tape over and over again and i felt like i was winning into the second round then he had that point taken away but i felt i could have won that round despite the point being taken away i can see why a lot of people were complaining about it because i should have opened up earlier in the fight
9343044 i started training in 2003 after i graduated from college and i started training because i was still competitive i wrestled in the collegiate leagues at michigan state and i still felt like i wanted to get out there and compete and it just kind of caught on man i was a natural at it and the stuff started moving so i kept on going
9343045 it changed so fast it went from just being a normal dude walking around to everybody recognizing me to me im just a normal person but you see me as this fighter i can get kind of distracted and stuff like that and its kind of like damn rich franklin is one of the coolest guys i ever met and he is so down to earth and such a good teacher hes a good teacher and hes a good friend because he knows how to reach everybody he knows how to talk to everybody
9343046 this the liddell fight will be a good one for me but the title shot thing is not up to me
9343047 i would like to have a title shot but im not going to get my heart set on if i win this fight i will get a title shot because doing that is like trying to guess what the ufc has got going on in their agenda and i dont know and i dont care ill fight anyone they put in front of me
9343048 people are not going to see the head kick every single fight not because i dont bring it every single fight but because i dont always knock somebody out
9343049 but thats a good thing when you are respected in your time thats a mark of greatness so maybe later on theyll appreciate me the more that i do but just like ali and everybody else that achieved greatness before their time they will be appreciated

9343071 il faut s parer laction des gouvernements dont celui du f d ral de linstitutionnel le pays conna t une crise conomique profonde dont les gens vont ressentir les effets de plein fouet lautomne

9343074 jamais les socialistes naccepteront la fatalit de la r gression sociale au nom de la comp titivit
9343075 pas aux ecolos quand ils avaient la responsabilit du d partement pas les ministres lib raux pourtant pr sents pendant 5 ans non gr ce aux socialistes
9343076 je suis tr s f ch de voir loeuvre une ministre qui ne respecte pas ce qui a t n goci durement lors de la mise en place du gouvernement cest incorrect

9343083 its not just about me and a gospel tent the idea is to work as christians together who have a heart to reach these people here on drugs and alcohol destroyed lives difficulties
9343084 we wanted to create a ministry which is specially focusing to help the aboriginal people and the development of the gospel amongst them
9343085 ive lived here a year i deal with christians in the vla theres a good spirit here to do good there is a lot of good people here but they have ended up in some wrong ways and they need to come out of that because there is a better way
9343086 and it doesnt happen just through a tent meeting it happens through all these ministries
9343087 people are interested in the vla in doing something and going somewhere
9343088 this will help hopefully as people come to god and come to these tent meetings that the crime will lessen and all the rest of it thats the purpose of it
9343089 m scifo ne peut accepter que son nom soit cit mauvais escient et sans aucune v rification pr alable du journaliste dans le cadre dune affaire judiciaire m diatis e
9343090 si monsieur alfano est lun de ses lointains cousins monsieur scifo nentretient aucun contact particulier avec lui

9343092 les rafales de vent ont diminu environ 205 km h contre 240 km h auparavant ndr avec des pics sup rieurs ce niveau gustav est un ouragan de cat gorie trois sur l chelle de saffir simpson
9343093 gustav va rester un important ouragan jusqu ce quil touche terre
9343094 det r sannolikt att petter andersson l mnar hammarby innan transferf nstret st nger
9343095 it remains likely that gustav will prove to be a worst case scenario for the producing region and places the heart of the oil production region under a high risk of sustaining significant or major damage
9343096 ill tell you one thing what i didnt know is how good our defense is over here
9343097 look at a guy like mike lowell hes so good over there you expect him to make every play i think thats the way our whole defense has gotten
9343098 these data suggest that telmisartan confers a modest benefit when added to other proven therapies
9343099 in view of the drugs tolerability and effect on cardiovascular endpoints telmisartan could be regarded as a potential treatment for patients with vascular disease or high risk diabetes if they are unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor
9343100 arbs that have been studied in coronary disease are safe but possibly less effective alternatives in patients with intolerance to ace inhibitors although data are too limited to reach definitive conclusions the clinical effect of arbs seems less robust than that of ace inhibitors
9343101 who is mccain going to pick for his running mate
9343102 what this brings is a spirit of reform and change that is vital now in our nations capital
9343103 eighty four percent of the american people think the countrys on the wrong track in our party we have corruption we have former members of congress residing in federal prison so its not surprising to me that weve seen an incredible invigoration around our party and around the nation not just republicans but democrats by the way in the last day and a half or whatever its been we have raised 4 million on the internet i wish i had taken her a month ago
9343104 got the right judgment she doesnt think like senator obama does that iran is a minor irritant
9343105 she knows that the surge worked and succeeded and she supported that
9343106 senator obama still still to this day refuses to acknowledge that the surge has succeeded shes been commander in chief of the alaska guard that has served back and back in fact as you know shes got a son whos getting ready to go but shes had the judgment on these issues that senator obama hes had all the wrong judgments governor palin understands these issues and she understands the challenges that we face
9343107 travelling to kuwait including being involved in these issues and look im so proud that she has displayed the kind of judgment and she has the experience and judgment as an executive shes run a huge economy up there in the state of alaska twenty percent of our energy comes from the state of alaska and energy is obviously one of the key issues for our nations security
9343108 as governor she has had enormous responsibilities none of which senator obama had when she was in government he was a community organizer when she was taking tough positions against her own party senator obama was voting present 130 times in the state legislature on every tough issue whatever it was she was taking them on thats the kind of judgment that im confident that we need in washington
9343109 fear god and give him glory throw down the whole quickly because gods hour of judgment has come worship the maker of heaven and earth salt sea and fresh water will cut down chaff that eschews god to worship at the tiara of mistress babylon

9343159 the establishments failure to shoot me down has been nothing short of astonishing
9343160 s i hayakawa was a believer in the theory called the whorfian hypothesis that the way we cut up the world into categories is entirely arbitrary the way we cut up the world into categories is in general not arbitrary at all this is as true for categories that have fuzzy borders as for those that are clearly delineated night and day are as different as well night and day even though its hard to tell where one ends and the other begins the night day distinction is something we would be aware of even if we didnt have words for it
9343161 what makes a category is not a word but a concept babies as young as three months can categorize and hence must be able to form concepts jean piaget the famous swiss developmentalist thought they couldnt but he was wrong babies are easily bored so if we show them lots of pictures of cows pretty soon they stop paying attention to them if we then throw in a picture of a horse and the baby suddenly looks interested again we know that she can tell the difference between cow and a horse

9343167 the female brain is predominantly hard wired for empathy the male brain is predominantly hard wired for understanding and building systems
9343168 empathizing is the drive to identify another persons emotions and thoughts and to respond to them with an appropriate emotion empathizing does not entail just the cold calculation of what someone else thinks and feels or what is sometimes called mind reading psychopaths can do that much empathizing occurs when we feel an appropriate emotional reaction an emotion triggered by the other persons emotion and it is done in order to understand another person to predict their behavior and to connect or resonate with them emotionally
9343169 does this mean we should do everything for the sake of seducing others
9343170 isnt your desire to seduce others a clear sign of your low self esteem
9343171 what about the people who were recognized for their greatness posthumously
9343172 does this mean we should do everything for the sake of seducing others

9343185 i dont think we challenge ourselves enough in terms of our internal processes
9343186 one of the things thats bothered me is the no raiding pact which essentially says if you join a union youre there for life i think if one union doesnt satisfy your concerns you should have a right to join another
9343187 were fighting back were not accepting the logic that you have to cut your standard of living and everything will be fine
9343188 i think workers appreciate that in canada at least were fighting for them

9343192 it is important to remember we may never know what role listeriosis played in the death but we must keep in mind listeria is really only of concern to individuals who have weakened immune systems the elderly pregnant women and newborns

9343203 they still have blue eyes so we know they are very young
9343204 they just dont have the space to keep animals they are all volunteers doing what they can
9343205 when you consider it costs over 100 per animal for those procedures its not surprising people go to this extreme
9343206 some unscrupulous person dumped them off on the side of the road to die its cruel
9343207 its the same thing when people dump their junk in the woods here
9343208 either way people here are stuck cleaning it up after them this is no different
9343209 its all right for now but once they get bigger i dont know what we will do

9343241 its a small benefit but we should always be emphasizing to patients what they can do in terms of diet that might help

9343243 the overall flood situation in the country is alarming and very likely to deteriorate by the next two to three days

9343246 i have said that if some european countries want to serve someone elses foreign policy interests then we cant stop them but i also think that charity begins at home i believe that many of our european partners will be guided by this somewhat crude expression
9343247 the establishment has its own sensitivities which we keep in view while taking decisions
9343248 the sharp fall in atf prices is on account of fall in prices of jet fuel in international market
9343249 we have registered a case and booked sahota for criminal intimidation cheating producing false documents and various other offences it is too early to disclose anything as our investigations are still on we are scrutinizing every detail of the case
9343250 archana kumar along with her son saksham went to britain in september 2003 on tourist visa she met sahota a friend of her uncle there he took the passports of archana and saksham to prepare an application for an asylum for them in britain
9343251 i could not complaint against him as i do not know english he said that he will kill my son if i go to the police
9343252 he harassed me both physically and emotionally he beat me so brutally that many times i had to be admitted in hospitals for months he told me that he has links with punjabs politicians and terrorists
9343253 i called the police because it was indecent especially as there were some families around
9343254 for the time being we do not want to change our pricing and surcharge strategy
9343255 we want to see medium term development of atf prices before we take a call even with this decrease prices are significantly above the levels compared to six months ago
9343256 what the industry needs now is that fuel prices remain at the same level for at least two months

9343263 veel voorzitters van andere omroepen met wie ik vaak jarenlang heb opgetrokken zijn overleden vertrokken of bezig te verdwijnen onze rol als omroepvoorzitters werd steeds beperkter dat proces is al een paar jaar geleden ingezet door besluitvorming vanuit de overheid mijn afscheid als voorzitter zie ik als een afsluiting van hoe hilversum in elkaar zat
9343264 jaap en arjan hebben in de achterliggende periode veel van mijn taken waargenomen omdat het per 1 september h n werk wordt we hebben de afgelopen tijd veel en intensief met elkaar gesproken ze staan voor een enorme uitdaging maar ik ben ervan overtuigd dat ze er klaar voor zijn
9343265 allereerst het feit dat we een grote omroep zijn geworden in 1992 gingen we van de b naar de a status het tweede is dat daarmee een grote verandering in leiding kwam de organisatiestructuur van de eo is nogal eens gewijzigd dat heeft vooral te maken met het beleid dat de overheid voerde die verandering is dus ook continu ten derde noem ik de programmatische veranderingen van een omroep met een eigen vaste avond zijn we een omroep geworden die hard zn best moet doen om uren te verkrijgen op verschillende zenders ook dat is een groot verschil
9343266 de grote evenementen zoals de nederland zingt dagen en de eo jongerendag wanneer je de mensen lijfelijk ontmoet de millenniumviering in zwolle en het afgelopen eo jubileumjaar met de reis die ik samen met vierhonderd eo leden heb gemaakt naar isra l ook van de regionale ontmoetingsavonden heb ik altijd erg genoten ze bestaan helaas niet meer maar we denken na over nieuwe vormen om die ontmoetingen met onze achterban weer vorm te geven
9343267 door nederland zingt en door de vele brieven en mailtjes die ik kreeg had ik altijd heel veel contact met onze leden dit zal waarschijnlijk wel zo blijven het is natuurlijk w l zo dat er voor mij nu een periode komt van verder afbouwen ook wat het presenteren van programmas betreft want ik heb wel het eeuwige leven maar niet hier op aarde ik ben inmiddels 66 jaar ik vind het fijn dat ik zij het op de achtergrond en niet meer als voorzitter de nieuwe directie de komende tijd kan steunen jaap en arjan nemen zon tachtig procent over van wat ik als voorzitter tot nu toe deed de nieuwgevormde raad van toezicht onder voorzitterschap van ad de boer wordt toezichthouder naast ad hebben we daar zeer bekwame en ervaren mensen voor gevonden daar ben ik geweldig blij mee de breedte is goed vertegenwoordigd zowel in beroepen als in kerkelijke achtergrond
9343268 de gang van zaken van de eo is mijn voortdurende zorg geweest
9343269 mijn werk bij de eo laat zich typeren door twee leuzen
9343270 allereerst dicht bij god en dicht bij mensen ik hoop dat ik dicht bij god mag leven in die grondhouding heb ik als voorzitter gesproken geschreven en geleefd wat dicht bij mensen betreft ik durf te zeggen dat ik een vriend ben van iedereen niet alleen van premier balken ende maar ook van een jongen met het downsyndroom die mij herkent en een kus geeft de tweede leus is oecumene van het hart wat iets anders is dan een oecumene van het gevoel het is belangrijk dat we elkaar als eo leden over kerkmuren heen blijven herkennen en vinden in de here jezus door mijn geloofshouding weerspiegeld in die twee leuzen en door mijn staan in de nederlandse maatschappij ben ik als voorzitter in staat geweest om al die verschillende groepen binnen onze achterban te begrijpen en bij elkaar te houden in de hoofdzaken zijn we n en met verschillen moeten we bescheiden omgaan
9343271 we zijn als eo weliswaar een veelkleurig maar geen wazig gezelschap het gaat om de kern jezus christus de enige weg naar god anderen van hem vertellen zijn koninkrijk verwachten en voorleven dat is onze onveranderlijke missie ook na 1 september
9343272 de eerste groep ervaart het werk als een soort lot niet alles kan leuk zijn in het leven en dat geldt ook voor het werk christenen kunnen deze houding soms zelfs vanuit hun geloof motiveren met een gelaten houding begint het zwoegen opnieuw weer een lang jaar overleven met nieuwe donderjagers in groep zeven of weer een jaar slechtgeschreven bezwaarschriften van zeurende burgers behandelen groep twee is maar heel klein dat is de groep die de koers radicaal omgooit de durfals niet langer het vertrouwde werk als directiesecretaresse willen doen maar de ultieme droom najagen een eigen bed amp breakfast in de dordogne beginnen of een klein modewinkeltje in het centrum van utrecht doe ik het n niet dan verzuip ik tot slot heb je een groep die blijft zitten waar ze zit maar zich niet gedwee overgeeft aan het zogenaamde lot deze mensen houden hun baan en het eigen functioneren eens goed tegen het licht dat er iets moet gebeuren is duidelijk direct van baan veranderen kan een oplossing zijn maar hoeft helemaal niet per se om toch weer fris aan de slag te gaan
9343273 en zo is het ook de ideale baan bestaat cht niet
9343274 ideaal in de zin dat je voor honderd procent tevreden bent is het nooit alles zou daarin moeten kloppen het salaris de inhoud je collegas de afwisseling de reisafstand maar het is een utopie tachtig procent tevredenheid tegenover twintig procent frustratie dat kun je de meer re le ideale baan noemen komt dat percentage onder de vijftig procent te liggen dan wordt het problematisch en is het tijd voor actie
9343275 die hebben misschien jaren geleden al innerlijk ontslag genomen en proberen het uit te zingen
9343276 het zal je vast niet verbazen dat de nekharen van een loopbaanbegeleider bij deze houding rechtovereind gaan staan maar ook als christen kan ik het niet rijmen met wat ik in de bijbel lees over een gezonde arbeidsethos in het zweet uws aanschijns zult ge brood eten is zon veelgehoord bijbelgedeelte het klinkt misschien heel vroom als je zegt dat werk je lot is alleen vraag ik me af wat de chte drijfveer is is het een bewuste keuze om het lot te accepteren of vooral de angst om de confrontatie aan te gaan met je passiviteit
9343277 die gaan op zoek naar hun unieke bestemming en gods bijzondere roeping voor h n leven natuurlijk is dit gechargeerd maar het kleurt de kerkelijke kaart wel daarnaast is er nog een groep die geloof en werk niet zo duidelijk met elkaar verbindt
9343278 we zullen moeten accepteren dat het ons niet gaat lukken om de hemel op aarde te cre ren ook niet in ons werk
9343279 het is heel inspirerend om te horen en het kan anderen stimuleren om ook stappen te zetten aan de andere kant merk ik dat er vaak vluchtgedrag bij komt kijken het zegt dan meer iets over de onvrede over het huidige dan dat er voldoende realiteitszin is voor dat hele andere eigenaar worden op een camping in tsjechi lijkt wel ideaal maar heb je gedacht aan de negatieve kanten heb je voldoende inkomsten hoe kom je de winter door weet je hoe hard het werken is
9343280 veel loopbaanbegeleiding is gericht op loopbaankeuze het is deze baan of die deze werkwijze gaat meer over hoe ik weer vitaal in mijn huidige baan kom te staan voor ouderwetse loopbaanbegeleiding staan veel bedrijven niet te springen uit angst dat het hun mensen naar een concurrent zal leiden deze aanpak gericht op het revitaliseren is veel minder bedreigend en daar plukken werknemers de vruchten van of ik dit vooral in mijn eigen belang zeg ha natuurlijk wil ik veel mensen begeleiden maar ik heb het vooral over een grote maatschappelijke ontwikkeling de uitstroom van babyboomers is begonnen en de komende vijf tot tien jaar gaat er met name in de publieke sector een enorm gevecht ontstaan om goede werknemers te vinden en te houden
9343281 iedereen kan voor zichzelf de balans opmaken zet je eisen wensen kwaliteiten en mogelijkheden eens goed op een rijtje stel jezelf vragen als heb ik invloed in mijn werk praat ik er tijdens de barbecue op de camping graag over wat mis ik maar ook hoe kan ik persoonlijk nog veranderen waar wil ik over vijf jaar staan de antwoorden kunnen je helpen om knelpunten te herkennen en actie te ondernemen betrek je werkgever hierin en vraag bijvoorbeeld welke nieuwe projecten hij je wil geven vergeet niet je baas heeft meer dan ooit belang bij gemotiveerde medewerkers en voor jezelf wat zou het heerlijk zijn als je na de volgende vakantie alleen nog maar je frisse tegenzin moet overwinnen als het werk weer op je wacht
9343282 it is historic day and victory day for us we have decided to celebrate august 31 as vijay diwas annually
9343283 the governor has sent me a letter and requested me to read it out to all who are present at the agitation dais he has suggested me to select a mediator between the government and us if only the party wants to sort out the singur issue
9343284 i thank him for his concern but the increasing mass support we are getting at the moment proves that we dont need mediators
9343285 but our demand is fixed the government has to return 400 acres of farmland to the unwilling farmers we are ready to mutually sort out other technical problems
9343286 the way mamata banerjee trinamool congress president is demanding it is impossible for the state government to meet her demand legally it is not possible to return the land acquired under land acquisition act
9343287 the issue was also taken to the calcutta high court and it said that land acquisition was as per law
9343288 the decision has been taken unilaterally by the central government which has not taken care of the sensitivity of the majority community
9343289 any decision on this matter should have been taken only through consensus
9343290 jammu appeasement policy will further increase the alienation of kashmiris
9343291 i see it as a very good sign the hatred that was developing between communities in the state has come to an amicable end
9343292 the decision has been taken unilaterally by the central government which has not taken care of the sensitivity of the majority community
9343293 any decision on this matter should have been taken only through consensus
9343294 jammu appeasement policy will further increase the alienation of kashmiris
9343295 i see it as a very good sign the hatred that was developing between communities in the state has come to an amicable end
9343296 what has happened in singur is unfortunate for west bengal for india and for all progressive indians
9343297 this event will unleash fear and uncertainty in the minds of all investors indian and foreign and is likely to be a stumbling block in the excellent gdp growth india has demonstrated in the last decade
9343298 it is time that all well intentioned indians stand up and demand a peaceful logical and constructive way of settling the issue of farmland in singur and elsewhere in india
9343299 it is still possible to resolve the issue through negotiation but the discussions should be within legal parameters and based on ground realities they should not raise demands which are not realistic and legally impossible
9343300 the fact is they cannot set up stages on the expressway and have people assemble there it is unlawful
9343301 trinamool congress dispute with peoples aspirations and not with the left front
9343302 if you knew someone that survived or even died from breast cancer youd think differently

9343304 what the state government doing is negligible but the centres approach is very generous
9343305 then why did the breach occur at 11 am the very next day
9343306 it is total negligence on the part of the state government
9343307 the way mamata banerjee trinamool congress president is demanding it is impossible for the state government to meet her demand legally it is not possible to return the land acquired under land acquisition act
9343308 the issue was also taken to the calcutta high court and it said that land acquisition was as per law
9343309 there is a one line solution everything will be settled if the ancillary units are relocated to the land on the opposite side of the small car unit
9343310 we should have left the place earlier with essential supplies running out we might starve if no fresh stocks are reached
9343311 what has happened in singur is unfortunate for west bengal for india and for all progressive indians
9343312 this event will unleash fear and uncertainty in the minds of all investors indian and foreign and is likely to be a stumbling block in the excellent gdp growth india has demonstrated in the last decade
9343313 it is time that all well intentioned indians stand up and demand a peaceful logical and constructive way of settling the issue of farmland in singur and elsewhere in india

9343324 it is clear that we do have a two speed economy sectors such as banking housing and retail are certainly suffering but as a manufacturer we are far from unique in bucking the trend our success and that of others who are doing well is based on three factors facing outward to the world and not just relying on the uk investing in world class product development to meet world demand and finally chasing markets in the petrodollar economies that are keen to develop their industrial and economic infrastructure before the oil runs out

9343397 this weeks report that results from adagio have been presented at a scientific meeting is noteworthy in that it confirms completion of a very large and well designed study of the potential modifying effects of clinical outcome in pd patients taking an medication
9343398 it is also important to note that the data though promising and provocative have not yet been made available widely in the scientific community and even more importantly they have not yet been exposed to the process of scientific peer review that is crucial to validating the results of scientific research until such time as the findings are published in a refereed scientific journal which we hope will be no more than a few months from now we are unable to say whether or not early treatment with azilect has long term benefits in modifying the course of parkinsons disease related disabilities after critical review of the data and scholarly interpretation of the results clinicians will be in a better position to determine if prescribing patterns and advice to patients will change in the meantime people with parkinsons who are interested in this matter or who are concerned about their own treatment regimen should consult individually with their physicians

9343643 it gets them used to the whole concept of school
9343644 but hes kind of shy so i think this kind of opens him up more a program like this
9343645 they know that someone other than their parents can make them happy
9343646 there was plenty to eat and we really needed the calories even the non athletes my own day involved a lot of walking a lot of standing i might catch a bus at 7 30 in the morning then not get back to the village until 11 p m
9343647 id see them leaving the village about 11 p m they would be out celebrating until 7 or so in the morning but that was only after the competition in their particular sports had been completed
9343648 people dont realize that the international olympic committee is almost like a shell organization other organizations administer the individual sports for example the federation internationale de natation fina administers five aquatic sports it isnt the olympic committees job to run those activities

9343650 in the fourth period the serbians were taking some tough shots at our kids the one you saw me treating had taken a hit in the eye it needed three stitches i felt i needed to get him back in the water right away he was back in the game with only a minute to go then guess what he got hit again
9343651 one of their goalies threw another player down a flight of stairs

9343655 i saw 20 or more athletes in clothing that had georgia on it they were bailing out i asked around and found out what had happened
9343656 unless their baby teeth fly out during a bar routine i dont think there is any way to check that out
9343657 he could be walking the streets and you wouldnt know it
9343658 even with the correct credentials i could be screened up to five or 10 times a day while getting to where i wanted to go the chinese were extremely meticulous about credentials and about things like where you were going and what door you should go through i never saw cars and buses screened so carefully
9343659 i wasnt restricted at all and i heard no stories about any visitors being harassed
9343660 the olympic village where the athletes and staff stayed was gorgeous waterfalls arches free penny arcades
9343661 you could turn in your laundry and have it returned in 10 hours

9343672 i think that this film in some ways is an attempt to address a number of issues that are amongst the most pressing issues for the human race the original being a cold war film was addressing what was clearly the greatest threat for the human race at that time mutual nuclear destruction and thats not the most pressing threat that we face now its also man vs man we are destroying each other as well our countrys at war right now there is certainly the issue being addressed in the movie of our treatment of one another on the planet i think its a movie about human nature as much as anything else and how human nature is acting itself out in the world right now
9343673 if the earth dies you die if you die the earth survives
9343674 who wants to see a movie wherein the person viewing it is effectively equated with cancer
9343675 in the original movie klaatu specifically states that as long as our violence was confined to earth it was nobodys business but earths it was mankinds development of space travel and the threat of spreading our violent ways to other planets that supposedly brought klaatu here with gort

9343716 theres always an enemy if you know where to look
9343717 hemos tomado esta decisi n despu s de comprobar que no hab a buen feeling entre pedrosa y michelin
9343718 del feeling entre el piloto y el equipamiento de que dispone especialmente los neum ticos
9343719 me parece raro que un piloto pueda cambiar de neum ticos a mitad de temporada y otros no yo estoy contento con michelin pero esta noticia me parece un poco extra a porque parece ser que s lo l tiene la posibilidad de cambiar de neum ticos
9343720 me ha molestado que desde mayo mi padre y mi representante hayan intentado renovar mi contrato pero el club pensaba fichar a cristiano ronaldo y no ten a tantas ganas de renovarme
9343721 no fue una ni dos ni tres veces las que mi representante y mi padre fueron al club a renovar han ido m s de mil veces y el club tampoco se interes mucho por mi permanencia no tengo nada contra cristiano me parece un excelente jugador pero tengo mi valor y mi orgullo ahora como el club no ha conseguido fichar parece que no les interesa que me vaya pero yo yengo mi orgullo y mi intenci n es salir
9343722 el club dijo que volvieran en septiembre cuando se cierran las negociaciones
9343723 antes pens que estar a diez a os pero no es posible y ahora tengo ganas de salir
9343724 el problema es que el club no ha conseguido fichar a nadie
9343725 la situaci n no ha cambiado nada siguen las negociaciones yo sigo con la misma idea de marcharme del real madrid quiero jugar en el chelsea se lo he dicho al presidente directivos mijatovic y al entrenador por en sima vez lo digo ante la prensa todav a el entrenador piensa que me puede recuperar pero mi cabeza est en el chelsea
9343726 schuster no es mi padre es mi entrenador no me va a obligar a hacer nada est mirando sus objetivos y yo el m o hasta ahora no ten a ning n problema con l el presidente y pedja mijatovic me dejan salir el club est de acuerdo conmigo pero schuster no porque se ha comprometido a recuperarme si piensa eso es problema suyo no quiero seguir en el real madrid
9343727 si tengo que estar una a o sin jugar lo estar me recuperar porque soy joven tengo 24 a os y es el destino
9343728 no me voy a negar tengo contrato si me hiciesen jugar lo har a aunque no estar contento
9343729 se parece mucho a l la forma de jugar de zidane era espectacular y todo el mundo esperaba cosas diferentes de l con deco pasa lo mismo personalmente creo que est a la altura de jugadores como messi o cristiano ronaldo
9343730 nuestros jugadores han entendido que deco debe ser unos de los m s importantes del equipo el conjunto rival siempre est pendiente de l y eso permite a los dem s jugadores tener m s movilidad es un jugador muy inteligente
9343731 estar al ritmo de valentino y stoner es dif cil pero volver al podio es extraordinario
9343732 es un jugador de alto nivel y es una gran responsabilidad no s si conseguir hacerle olvidar pero espero suplir las necesidades del equipo
9343733 ten a otra idea del f tbol galo lo cierto es que estoy muy contento de volver a espa a intentar aportar lo m ximo al equipo
9343734 el f tbol espa ol favorece mis caracter sticas en francia me cost un poco aunque di bastantes asistencias y acab marcando goles
9343735 abierto ofensivo que intenta buscar el uno contra uno con pase que tiene definici n un poco de velocidad y espero sacar lo mejor de m mismo
9343736 la plantilla es m s o menos la del a o pasado la primera vuelta de la temporada pasada estuvieron arriba y espero que se puede repetir
9343737 un poco extra o un poco at pico hemos atacado durante 90 minutos y hemos sido castigados excesivamente en dos ocasiones en las que el bolonia tuvo m s lucidez
9343738 el mercado no ofrec a el perfil de nueve que nosotros quer amos por lo que de acuerdo con el t cnico hemos decidido esperar al mercado de invierno
9343739 hace quince d as me ve a jugando en tercera con el palamos ya fue una sorpresa el inter s del girona pero es que adem s me veo en el equipo titular el d a del estreno de la liga y encima marco el gol de la victoria es alucinante
9343740 no s lo por la victoria tambi n por la imagen que hemos dado de fiabilidad
9343741 ya s lo faltan 50 puntos para la salvaci n
9343742 people have not stopped coming to mosques despite increased insecurity but yes everyone is concerned and keeps inner fears
9343743 we usually celebrate ramadan as a month of prayers and inner joy but this time round it is hard to celebrate it with the same fervour
9343744 debe centrarse en el mismo criterio que ha sido totalmente ignorado
9343745 lamenta profundamente el comportamiento de los dirigentes del chelsea fc que a pesar de conocer perfectamente la decisi n de no traspasar al jugador han continuado realizando gestos y manifestaciones que han llegado al extremo de vender camisetas del jugador a trav s de su web oficial todo lo cual no ha hecho sino enturbiar la situaci n y confundir a la opini n p blica
9343746 ganar aqu era mi sue o de peque o hay que vivir la carrera para saber lo que es
9343747 era un reto que ten a en la cabeza desde peque o tienes que participar para saber lo que es ha sido impresionante y quiero aplaudir al p blico porque sin ellos esto no habr a sido lo mismo
9343748 hasta el final de la noche me encontraba bien pero a partir de las 14 horas de carrera ha sido duro porque las piernas ya comienzan a doler pero el dolor no es nada comparado con la emoci n que viv en la salida de la carrera disfrutando de los paisajes ha sido incre ble
9343749 yo ya conozco la dureza de estas pruebas porque llevo entren ndome desde los 15 a os a mi me gusta la dureza y creo mucho en la motivaci n
9343750 hasta cruzar la meta no supe si podr a acabar o no ahora mi nico objetivo es recuperarme porque estoy muerto
9343751 la nica palabra que se me ocurre es est pido
9343752 deber a pilotar m s limpio llega un momento en el que hay que decir basta
9343753 a aquella persona o personas o instituci n que adem s de la ejemplaridad de su vida y obra haya conseguido nuevas metas en la lucha del hombre por superarse a s mismo y contribuido con su esfuerzo de manera extraordinaria al perfeccionamiento cultivo promoci n o difusi n de los deportes
9343754 another valuable day in monza and we have learnt some interesting things that will help us prepare for the race here in a couple of weeks time
9343755 we tried lots of different things with the set up and then did some suspension work in the afternoon as using the curbs is important here i think we have taken the car in the right direction and we have a good basis to build on over the race weekend
9343756 we spent the day looking at the set up and completing all the usual monza specific work because this place is so different to all the other tracks that we run at we continued with our race preparation programme collecting data and found some very positive directions with the set up so we are in reasonable shape going into the race here
9343757 both drivers had their work split this week between preparation for the next race in spa and the subsequent race at monza
9343758 monza is a unique circuit with very high speed and low downforce characteristics which gives the driver difficulties in the big braking areas and with traction out of the slow corners our drivers suffered all the classic problems that we habitually experience at monza and without traction control engine driveability adds another dimension to the challenge
9343759 we have not achieved a perfect set up and balance this week and have further work to do in analysing the data before we return for the race in two weeks time
9343760 sell item from you own website avbaul is a new and unseen way to buy for secondlife that will allow you to buy from any web
9343761 you never actually get to know who is cooking for the queen but i wouldnt employ him because the food was s t
9343762 unfortunately you have to go through the ceremony with the canapes which are just absolutely shockingly s t
9343763 necesit bamos esto es important simo lo buscamos mucho y se nos dio ahora tenemos que seguir creciendo
9343764 es una cancha dur sima y eso le da m s valor y sentido al triunfo
9343765 en el segundo tiempo racing se cay un poco por el cansancio pero en el balance del partido el equipo hizo las cosas bien
9343766 defensivamente el equipo estuvo muy bien ordenado y a la altura de lo que era el partido
9343767 no sali un buen partido porque ten amos que jugar de esta forma de acuerdo a las caracter sticas y lo que pregona el rival nos tuvimos que adaptar
9343768 no se sinti la falta de ninguno de los dos
9343769 the first page of his first novel the last jihad puts you inside the cockpit of a hijacked jet coming in on a kamikaze attack into an american city which leads to a war with saddam hussein over weapons of mass destruction yet it was written before 9 11 long before the actual war with iraq
9343770 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
9343771 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
9343772 the first page of his first novel the last jihad puts you inside the cockpit of a hijacked jet coming in on a kamikaze attack into an american city which leads to a war with saddam hussein over weapons of mass destruction yet it was written before 9 11 long before the actual war with iraq
9343773 the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life
9343774 at some future period not very distant as measured by centuries the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace the savage races throughout the world
9343775 he will be able to compete successfully with his bigger brained and smaller jawed rival in a contest which is to be carried out on by thoughts and not by bites
9343776 so if the races of man are to survive it is ok for us to exterminate the lower races in order for the higher races to survive
9343777 im eliminating the competition in order for my offspring to survive might makes right but we are taught that this is wrong morals have always been taught to kids so we can eliminate this behavior out of them
9343778 grand master freemason albert pike was instrumental in the klan many could have gotten sucked into those troubled times what does this have to do with being anti communist my education post shows marxist influence on education are you defending marxism now
9343779 what does this have to do with being ant communist
9343780 apathy are you saying the new world order doesnt exist
9343781 is it hatefull to be against hitler his mass murder and those who put him in power
9343782 johnny you are the one who commits a hatefull act by claiming hitlers actions were somehow christian when hitler set about his pagan nazi movement to destroy christianity with an emphasys on the protestant christianity of germany and indeed all of europe post war the conspiracy counter reformation set all of protestant north east germany in the ussr for forced atheism
9343783 what brings you to this forum you came directly to this thread and dogmaticly disregard any and all evidence for a global flood there is a mountain of evidence for the flood that even the blind can see the universal chalk layer polystrate fossils pillow lava on mtn tops non confomities within the geo column rappid petrification the numerous fraudulent dating methods used yet carbon dating shows coal is young which is disregarded billions of years do not exist neither millions
9343784 the only ones dogmatically clinging to this fairy tale of pagan evolution are either those in the education field for obvious reasons or pagans themselves freemasons knights kabalist all other witches or roman catholics who will not accept the bible including genesis which does not support their pope they often call themselves atheist and call catholics christian as if they are an expert on christianity for them accepting genesis would mean becoming a protestant excommunication and being disowned by their family a high price to pay for standing up for the truth the truth is a divider
9343785 none of your dating works you cant prove that the earth is millions of years old you guys cant even get 2 test to give the same result bet still stands perform your own tests
9343786 you dont have any if you did they would be paraded around not locked up in the basement of the smithsonian like the coelacanth lol
9343787 sorry not true their are always resistant strains they survive and breed they were already immune same as a killer flu virus it will kill off a lot of people but not all the people why some are just immune from it and will most likely pass that on to their offspring but its not guaranteed now if a virus turned into a moue that would be different now wouldnt it
9343788 ya a dog will always produce a dog it will never make a cat although their is a catdog kinds always produce the same kind catdog http www youtube com watch v r7 qjo7bdms
9343789 thats nice johhny use a creationist that set up the chart by similarities wasnt darwin a creationist i believe so if by your reckoning of dna then were most closely related to the eggplant a chimp is higher on the evolutionary scale than we are and a fern is the highest evolved form of life on the planet nice one bj
9343790 wow do i really need to address this again one no where on earth can you find the geological column in its exact geological order and second you date the order by the fossils found in the layer at the same time you date those fossils by which layer they were found in third most of the time the younger layers are on the bottom and the older layers are on top like on the continental shelfs
9343791 the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life
9343792 the more civilized so called caucasian races have beaten the turkish hollow in the struggle for existence looking to the world at no very distant date what an endless number of lower races has been eliminated by the higher civilized races throughout the world
9343793 i think we must admit that the only acceptable explanation is creation i know that this is anathema to physicists as it is to me but we must not reject a theory that we do not like if the experimental evidence supports it
9343794 now this professor is an advocate of the theory of evolution
9343795 i believe that you can feel the religious overtones in that statement concerning the theory of evolution you can also see that someone who has preached it with the great zeal of thisman has had his entire comprehension of the universe altered it is more than a science to this man it is his religion it has permeated his entirepersonality under the guise of intelligence
9343796 has now come to realize that the possibility of a cell coming into existence by chance is impossible
9343797 if it comes to a choice between believing in a creator and believing in a scientific impossibility i will believe the impossibility
9343798 stupid statement he is saying that over the eons as the eyes have evolved from one creature to the next theeyes have remained the same but the genetic information producing the eyes have changed he is saying that mutations produced thesame results but with different combinations of genes thats utterly ridiculous but it is typical of the desperate measures taken by the evolutionist tobe able to hold on to his god the theory of evolution
9343799 if the theory of evolution is true we should see organs in the human body for instance that were useful to the human during his evolution but that since have become useless
9343800 there are about 180 organs in the human body listed by evolutionists as being in this category they included things such as the appendix the thymus gland and the big toe
9343801 guess what else is part of the auto immune system
9343802 the truth is there are no organs that do not have a purpose if evolution really happened we should see them
9343803 we should also see organs being born that is organs that seeing strange organs developing in our bodies organs that have no use at the present but that will have a use sometime in the future but we do not because there are none this is still another instance of the proclamation of assumed processes processes that have no proof of ever having happened
9343804 imagine the first amphibian as he started to evolve a wing at first it would be just a stub having evolved from a useful forearm in the midst of its evolution it would become a useless stub being halfway between a forearm and a wing it would have no function while evolving thus it places a severe handicap on the creature obviously natural selection would not allow such a thing to take place genetics certainly disallows it so there is no way with reasonable thought thatit could have happened
9343805 lucy has massive v shaped jaws in contrast to man
9343806 to complicate matters further some researchers believe that the afarensis sample lucy is really a mixture of two separate species the most convincing evidence for this is based on characteristics of the knee and elbow joints
9343807 johanson himself originally described the fossils as homo a species of man but soon after changed his mind based on the assessment of his colleague tim white they now describe the bones as too ape like in the jaws teeth and skull to be considered homo yet also sufficiently distinct from other later australopithecines to warrant their own species
9343808 the term falls outside the usual naming conventions for early humans and is used in a general sense to describe the oldest modern people in europe the skeletons showed the same high forehead upright posture and slender gracile skeleton as modern humans
9343809 dont you find that very strange for someone who was a keen supporter of the abolition of the christian led slave trade
9343810 sadly this has happened nothing of course to do with evolution nor with natural selection as i clearly demonstrated previously but more to do with
9343811 wasnt it white supremists who forced the native american into western ways by replacing his culture forever with the forced feeding of christianity and the english language
9343812 so yes i would say that instinctively we do have morals until organised religion comes along and arrogantly attempts top force its
9343813 try asking any jew who was part of or whose relation was part of the holocaust whether they blame it on darwins laws of evolution or whether they blame it on a white supremist christian nutcase if any answer the former i would be truly amazed
9343814 by the way i have two grown up children both absolutely wonderful citizens and wonderful people no religion whatsoever was rammed down their throats nor was atheism by the way and they are both non religious now religion is a totally redundant concept by the way talking of morals isnt it great that crimes such as rape and murder are plummeting there is hope for all yet
9343815 well we dont need religion for that but it is obviously not working too well when we witness the greed of the
9343816 i also detect a lot of hatred towards catholics on these pages
9343817 is it hatefull to be against hitler his mass murder and those who put him in power
9343818 johnny you are the one who commits a hatefull act by claiming hitlers actions were somehow christian when hitler set about his pagan nazi movement to destroy christianity with an emphasys on the protestant christianity of germany and indeed all of europe post war the conspiracy counter reformation set all of protestant north east germany in the ussr for forced atheism
9343819 sure it does in darwins mind the races were not equal here in america blacks were thought of as being 3 4 human where do you think this idea came from youll probably say the bible but if you ever read it youll see your wrong that very thought came from darwinism darwin didnt bring or create racism he just made it socially acceptable darwin did list the races of man on a scale of evolution blacks and jews being on the bottom just above apes and monkeys
9343820 oh yes we can all agree that we are all the same now in this day and age but darwin didnt and you know it and you call me the dirty tricks guy darwin fully believed in the extermination of the lower races
9343821 the more civilized so called caucasian races have beaten the turkish hollow in the struggle for existence
9343822 darwin spoke of the gorilla and the negro as occupying evolutionary positions between the baboon and the civilized races of man so darwin was a racist also i claim no part of jehovah witnesss teachings thanx now can we get back to the point at hand where morals come from but you continue to push the racist agenda sorry the bible clearly teaches that all men of all races all come from the same source has there been racisism in the past yes will there continue to be racism in the future most assurdley is it taught in the bible no
9343823 sorry your misleading again we had wars but not genocide of a race the concept of the complete obliteration of a race did not come about untill after darwin
9343824 for one i am opposed to negro citizenship in any and every form i believe this government was made on the white basis i believe it was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever and i am in favor of confining citizenship to white men men of european birth and descent instead of conferring it upon negroes indians and other inferior races now i do not believe that the almighty ever intended the negro to be the equal of the white man if he did he has been a long time demonstrating the fact for thousands of years the negro has been a race upon the earth and during all that time in all latitudes and climates wherever he has wandered or been taken he has been inferior to the race which he has there met he belongs to an inferior race and must always occupy an inferior position
9343825 im not lying at all thats what he believed i already showed that just because you refuse to accept that is not my problem
9343826 so where do the morals for your community come from it sure isnt instinct your community is going to raise the children to follow there examples thus teaching the child morals you have 2 kids do they ever lie did you teach them to lie and if you didnt did you teach them that its wrong to lie and if you had to teach them that it was wrong you just proved my point morals are taught and learned not ingrained
9343827 treat others as you would want to be treated by them
9343828 im only going to post a little of your christian bashing here 1 hitler was catholic not christian 2 more bible believing christians were killed in the holocaust than jews 3 i used hitler as a good example of darwinism put into practice and yes i could post examples of what was said and by whom but i wont just for you what i will say is this would darwin approve of what happened probably not did he help bring it about with his ideas yes hitler believed in the superman a person high up on the evolutionary chart so survival of the fittest works just fine
9343829 ahh the master of misleading strikes again this and your rant infront of it does not explain where morals come from and dude with hovind and taxes a little search of this site will show you just how wrong that is maybe you should google aaron russos freedom from fascism here ill provide a link after watching this you might think twice about that
9343830 provide examples of christian slave traders sufficient to prove that the slave trade was
9343831 the break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state as we may hope even than the caucasian and some ape as low as a baboon instead of as now between the negro or australian and the gorilla
9343832 your own quote belies the folly of your argument 150 years ago where are the great achievements of the black races when the white races were building great civilizations for thousands of years surely they should in all that time have come up with something more advanced than mud huts and selling their own kinfolk as slaves the worst oppressors of blacks have always been blacks perhaps the curse that god put on hams seed cainan after ham put his seed where it didnt belong carries some weight his seed have become the sort of men that servants would use as servants thus fulfilling what god said more than 4300 years ago there has always been slavery and there have been more white slaves than black the more productive slaves were slavs and hebrews you would call me a racist
9343833 please dont insult our intelligence by assuming we are as ignorant as you are
9343834 treat others as you would want to be treated by them

9343839 you know youre in beijing when you sit for dinner la carte and read the menu describing the herb encrusted steak as fragrant wonderful fat cow
9343840 perhaps as farewell dinner before leaving beijing youd have the obligatory peking duck why not a golden roasted spring chicken and when you read the menu describing the pullet as chicken without sexual life you realize its hard to say goodbye
9343841 permit me to tell you of my regret and anger the other day when i was at the ccp for king kasilags necrology before the start of the service i was ushered to the backstage a departure from the usual manner by which we honored our departed national artists after i had offered my bouquet to king i walked to my assigned seat and was surprised to see imelda marcos before me had i known that she would be there i would not have attended the necrology anymore but in deference to king who i loved dearly i decided to suffer her presence then she mounted the podium and started bragging about herself how chairman mao welcomed her in china that was too much so i decided to leave
9343842 in honoring the plunderers of this nation and letting them off easy without any punishment like erap we not only condone their infamy other rapists of this nation will also feel redeemed convinced that they did no wrong then they pave the way for future criminals to do the same sure that like imelda and her gang they will not be punished and that after their foul deeds they can even preen in the limelight before a people without memory
9343843 the marcoses were in power for more than 20 years they gave patronage with the peoples money to many these recipients of their patronage are grateful i can very well understand that but keep in mind that the evil that they did far outweighs the miniscule good that they achieved the cultural center is one and the appointment of king is another

9343848 well what we could see is an agreement by mr dion to an agenda that would be constructive and allow us to pass legislation priority areas like tackling crime and democratic reform where the liberal party has refused to deal with bills at committee refused to even allow them to be studied refused to allow our senate reform to go forward if they were to agree to an agenda where you could proceed with those things then there might be some possibility of avoiding an election but based on the positions the liberals have taken so far resisting those initiatives im not terribly optimistic but well see what comes out of the meeting
9343849 first of all there is no excuse for the prime minister breaking his promise with respect to fixed election dates he put that promise into the law hes now trying to break the spirit of the law and if he follows through on this threat he will begin an election campaign in another swirl of conservative dishonesty and the prime minister will have a lot of explaining to do secondly for there to be a productive session of parliament this fall there needs to be a change of tone in parliament thats a responsibility for all mps but the tone in particular is set by the government and set by the prime minister and the conservatives simply have to stop their pattern of thuggish behaviour when it comes to the parliament of canada and the committees of the parliament of canada

9343950 eine tonne co2 mittels solarenergie zu vermeiden kostet 700 euro eine tonne co2 abzuscheiden und unter der erde zu speichern kostet 60 euro letzteres ist die einzige m glichkeit die kologisch und konomisch sinn macht

9343982 after the end of the omonia aek game and despite the fact that everything had proceeded smoothly both in the arrival and departure of the supporters and while people were celebrating the victory of their team shortly after the end of the red star belgrade apoel match some other people perhaps incited by their own reasons chose to blacken the victory of their team
9343983 wearing hoods and helmets and carrying iron bars they flooded makarios avenue and caused severe damage to cars passing by but also to a particular caf

9344000 i thought i would apply for the nano project after gathering a couple of years experience at pune people from west bengal should come to pune and see how the city has prospered due to industrialisation
9344001 i thought the industrial image of the country particularly that of the state will change drastically with the start of the factory but with the recent developments it seems to be a distant dream
9344002 i thought my daughter can stay back in the state and work but with the changing scenario i am beginning to lose hope
9344003 these kids in the long run go out of the state and settle elsewhere had there been a project like tata in the state they could have tried to fetch a job to stay back

9344006 siamo stati molto bravi a gestire e chiudere la partita ho visto una squadra ben registrata e ricca in tutti i reparti e tutti si sono ben disimpegnati ho visto i nuovo arrivo bianchi vogliosissimo di ben figurare sono convinto che faremo un buon campionato
9344007 quando si vince per 3 a 0 non cosa da poco abbiamo disputato una prestazione intelligente e abbiamo saputo amministrare la gara anche quando le energie erano in calando sono contento dei giocatori subentrati in corso e per quanto non mi piace parlare dei singoli devo dire che corini stato eccezionale
9344008 la svolta stato il rigore e lespulsione di lopez ci siamo innervositi e abbiamo concesso alla lazio il gol del vantaggio a quel punto abbiamo perso ordine e concentrazione avevo in mente dei cambi ma poi si infortunato pisano e a quel punto ho dovuto rivederli abbiamo perso quattro a uno ma non tutto da buttare anzi voglio conservare la buona ora di gioco che il cagliari ha giocato quindi sono molto ottimista
9344009 sono contento di questa vittoria perch arriva dopo una partita tuttaltro che facile per merito dellavversario e colpa del gran caldo nel primo tempo abbiamo tenuto palla senza creare grandi occasioni nella ripresa potevamo sbloccare molto prima ma mareggini e la traversa non ci hanno permesso di festeggiare so quello che possono darci riccardo e marzeglia e sono felice che il loro ingresso ci abbia consentito di raggiungere questa importante vittoria le prima giornate di ogni campionato sono sempre particolari basta pensare che in serie a le grandi hanno stentato
9344010 mi aspettavo una bella prestazione e la squadra non mi ha deluso abbiamo giocato bene e siamo stati sfortunati in alcune circostanze prima con vastola e poi con molinari mi piaciuto molto mounard ma faccio i complimenti a mister giannini per la sua bravura nel leggere la partita e risistemare la squadra in pochissimo tempo mi piaciuto anche il pubblico che ha sfidato il caldo torrido di fine agosto scegliendo di sostenere questa squadra
9344011 we have always believed in passing on the benefit to consumers
9344012 the sharp fall in atf price is on account of fall in prices of jet fuel in international market
9344013 it fall in crude prices is a happy sign it is a welcome development but there is no scope for reduction in domestic retail prices
9344014 there still are huge under recoveries on fuel sales i dont see how we can reduce retail prices when our companies continue to lose money

9344034 k nftig m ssen wir unsere kompetenz unser programmverm gen und unseren sendeauftrag auf mehrere schultern verteilen
9344035 das war ein schwerer arbeitssieg aber ich denke er war auch verdient
9344036 das ist eine bilanz aus drei spielen die sehr d rftig ist
9344037 ich denke dass wir in den ersten 30 minuten die klar bessere mannschaft waren
9344038 die spiele in liechtenstein und finnland finden h chstwahrscheinlich ohne ihn statt
9344039 definitiv kann ich die frage allerdings erst am dienstag beantworten wenn ihn hans wilhelm m ller wohlfahrt untersucht hat

9344042 olli kahn hat den wunsch dass er nur f r bayern spielt warum wei ich auch nicht
9344043 und nach 70 75 minuten ist dann endg ltig schluss
9344044 ich werde sehr oft gefragt warum vater staat gerade f r so etwas entscheidendes wie die schul erstausstattung kein geld hat
9344045 es gibt gesetzesinitiativen mehrerer bundesl nder nach denen die kosten f r die schulausstattung bei hartz iv ber cksichtigt werden sollen

9344050 unser auftrag ist es das publikum an die zeitgen ssische kunst heranzuf hren
9344051 ich halte es aber auch f r wichtig j ngere tendenzen mit k nstlerischen positionen der 1960er und 1970er jahre in verbindung zu bringen
9344052 es ist mein ziel die kunsthalle baden baden wieder zu einem knotenpunkt der internationalen kunstszene zu machen
9344053 in the first half perhaps we paid a little too much respect to our opponents and were overawed by chelsea and playing in their stadium
9344054 in the second half that was a thing of the past we managed to keep the ball and our performance in the second half thoroughly deserved a point
9344055 arsene wenger wanted kalou to go to arsenal and to use him as a centre forward a no9 i said no
9344056 lo que me provoca es solicitar otra habilitante y clavarles otras 26 leyes pa que no sean rid culos
9344057 lo que me provoca es solicitar otra habilitante y clavarles otras 26 leyes pa que no sean rid culos vale es una ridiculez
9344058 ellos hablan contra las habilitantes pero no dicen qu es lo que les preocupa

9344110 die action in meinen filmen war h rter als in den amerikanischen western wirkte dadurch aber viel realistischer
9344111 ich war aber zu gro um den sport beruflich aus ben zu k nnen doch wegen meiner sportlichen f higkeiten wurde ich beim film als stuntman engagiert und sp ter auch als schauspieler
9344112 die produzenten hatten angst dass das publikum keinen italiener als westernhelden akzeptiert sie wollten die leute glauben machen dass sie sich einen amerikanischen western anschauen doch sie irrten sich denn die ringo filme wurden ein gro er erfolg beim n chsten western gab man mir meinen richtigen namen zur ck
9344113 viele ideen stammen von mir man berlie mir auch gern die stunts weil man wusste wozu ich in der lage bin und was ich mir zutraue
9344114 i have to start from the bottom but thats ok
9344115 one or two is pretty much the same the change i feel is the fans here are really supporting me and telling me im still no 1 and still the best
9344116 i would think it does five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered except maybe towards the end a little bit on clay rafa showed he was very good on clay other than that i was always expected to win so now it changes a bit rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time it will be interesting to see how he handles it
9344117 this is nice going into a major maybe not having no 1 beside me
9344118 every time we face a disaster in the state people from come from all the other states and help us so we are ready to give back for sure
9344119 oklahoma remembers all too well how frustrating it was for those citizens from new orleans impacted by katrina we dont know at this point what type of service they will require this time but certainly we will provide what we can for them
9344120 during the consultation process around removing unprofitable payphones a number of suggestions have been voiced by local people and local government
9344121 we have listened to these suggestions and can now confirm that local authorities that wish to maintain red telephone boxes minus the telephone equipment for aesthetic or heritage reasons will be able to do so
9344122 in addition local authorities that have requested to contribute to maintenance costs to retain a red telephone box with a working telephone will also be accommodated
9344123 im delighted that bt has agreed to what was always a perfectly simple proposal to ensure that red phone boxes do not disappear into the great grey blur of the modern british streetscape
9344124 the flo tv service allows consumers to stay connected to breaking news as it happens

9344139 we dont agree on everything but i respect her passion
9344140 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative one of the residents of wasila told the news more shes an excellent social conservative fiscal conservative and political conservative
9344141 if she can energize the conservative base it wont matter if she gets the womens vote
9344142 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative
9344143 the biggest significance of this deal is that cnpc will benefit as the first international oil company to be developing one of the giant discovered oil fields in iraq in the new era
9344144 they will be the first with people on the ground and the first to develop a working relationship with iraqs oil ministry
9344145 given traditional markets have been dominated by well established international oil companies new entrants such as cnpc have to focus on new markets
9344146 the majors are going to have to seriously rethink their returns criteria and resource ownership flexibility
9344147 looking forward to future bidding rounds iraq could cease to be that opportunity that people had hoped for and become a different play altogether
9344148 its difficult to see this having a wider implication for the majors and other contracts
9344149 this is a self contained project and is different in many ways to the large scale projects to boost oil capacity elsewhere in iraq
9344150 the successful use of uams on in flight uavs caps three years of program development
9344151 our work will improve safety and mission success for future uav systems and for the warfighters who depend upon them
9344152 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9344153 it is uncertain whether congress will take the administration up on its request
9344154 some republicans have already embraced the idea with representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican on the judiciary committee introducing a measure almost identical to the administrations proposal
9344155 recalls a resolution known as the authorization for use of military force passed by congress on sept 14 2001 which authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those responsible for the sept 11 attacks to prevent future strikes that authorization still in effect was initially viewed by many members of congress who voted for it as the go ahead for the administration to invade afghanistan and overthrow the taliban which had given sanctuary to mr bin laden
9344156 we feel good that were 1 0 but we have a lot to improve on im very proud of our kids theyve invested a lot of time and energy to create good chemistry

9344158 he prepared himself very well this camp jahvid is a no nonsense guy he really prides himself on knowing what hes doing and executing its really great to see him in full action and taking a load of the offense on his shoulders
9344159 im sure there were some doubters out there i felt really confident i could do the job ive been hungry for it it tastes good
9344160 i felt really good about how we played the run
9344161 can we stop the run against a downhill running team that was our biggest challenge
9344162 stopping the run was a point of emphasis for us
9344163 this is going to give us a ton of confidence there was a little question how we would do against the run in the 3 4 this is going to give us the type of confidence that guys are going to be flying around the field even faster next time
9344164 i dont think its really respectful for our own fans to boo a player
9344165 nate went in there and played well they dont even know what happened on that play hes a friend and a teammate he went in there and did his best things didnt work out the way he wanted to people dont even know what happened

9344175 una vergogna anche da parte delle forze dellordine che non hanno bloccato i tifosi gia a napoli luogo dei primi tafferugli questa mattina la partita andava sospesa tolleranza zero per questi animali che arrivano per distruggere e portare terrore tra i cittadini

9344184 the consequences of a lower provision of services are more serious than for most other specialties because there is a greater likelihood of death if surgery cannot be accessed by a patient who needs it

9344186 in terms of norovirus and patients with vomiting and diarrhoea we had a very positive weekend

9344188 it is difficult we have to treat it exactly the same
9344189 it is important that board shows a united front and i suspect there has been a bit of pressure on them
9344190 intuitively you would have to say it will push the price a bit higher
9344191 the very structure of the industry is always going to be based on procurement
9344192 its a big drop from an historically very large kill
9344193 we have no intention or plans to create that situation
9344194 everyone understands no one makes money out of procurement tensions
9344195 the implications of macro control and micro monitoring have been of significant concern to the otago museum trust board
9344196 it was a block of flats with people asleep inside
9344197 and as usual hasnt let the facts or nationals own record get in the way
9344198 the general election must be held by november 15 meaning that no appointments should have been made after august 15
9344199 we would not object to the odd appointment to fill unexpected vacancies if we were consulted but to appoint 52 board members for the entire country for three years is an abuse of power
9344200 these appointments are particularly provocative when national has announced policy that promotes shifting the focus of board appointments to greater involvement of outdoor recreationalists
9344201 by contrast national in government in 1990s made flagrantly political appointments to positions of significance
9344202 labour has been far more balanced in its appointments than national ever was for example former national prime minister jim bolger as head of kiwirail and former national minister paul east as a governor to the board of radio new zealand
9344203 her admission last week that she had been briefed by owen glenn means that she can make a valuable contribution to the committee in resolving who is right and who is wrong

9344206 theres never been anything else ive wanted to do ive always just wanted to be a ballet dancer it looks more certain now which is really exciting
9344207 shes absolutely ballet mad she lives breathes and eats ballet shed sleep here at the studio too if i let her
9344208 the australian ballet school is a highly prestigious international school its terribly difficult to get in and it really is a remarkable achievement for her
9344209 at a conservative estimate theyd audition well over 3000 people a year from all around the world thats how hard it is to get in
9344210 shes going to be big one day if youve gone to the australian ballet school youre not going to be out of work they use it as a feeder for the australian ballet company which is huge
9344211 one day i want to be a principal dancer and dance all over the world
9344212 when i dance i feel like anythings possible i cant imagine not doing it
9344213 hard seat battles but we think all of them will prevail
9344214 louisa is very fresh in were pretty pleased with her so far but we also think that is a winnable position
9344215 we think hes a rising star and we also think hell hold his seat reasonably well
9344216 and that ability can be used the ability to think through what people are saying to us what their needs and interests are and how this party might deal with those thats what i will be doing
9344217 the causes of asthma are still largely unknown and the processes involved in asthma development are incredibly complicated including family history environment and lifestyle
9344218 the employee concerned was responsible for transporting prisoners to their place of employment in the employers work van the investigation revealed that instead of escorting prisoners back to prison after finishing work early the employee escorted the prisoners to a residential address
9344219 at the residential address the prisoners were supplied with alcohol
9344220 the investigation also revealed that the employee transported one prisoner to the prisoners residential home to visit family instead of transporting them to work like the other prisoners
9344221 the employer took appropriate action to ensure a similar situation would not occur in the future and the workplace was considered suitable for the continued employment of prisoners on the release to work programme
9344222 gaining that assurance was the departments primary concern in allowing the relationship to continue with different release to work participants

9344226 then they went to gisborne to report it the next morning
9344227 it is a sickening attack from the point of view that their own safety and wellbeing was put at risk but also because this area is regarded by tourists to be a beautiful place to come

9344229 se entiende que un proyecto de la envergadura del que nos ocupa requiere de un an lisis m s profundo en cuanto a sus repercusiones sobre aquellos aspectos ambientales de mayor peso espec fico

9344436 if your only real exposure so far to crime comics has been the sin city graphic novels by frank miller or maybe their faithful big screen adaptations youd better fasten your seat belt youre in for a foot to the floor ride through this compendium of the cream of crime comics along the way youll see how several of millers acknowledged masters and peers enthrall with their pacing atmosphere and verbal and visual panache youll also see how millers battered bandaged marvin belongs in a long line up of lean mean machismo going back to the thirties and before when gangsters fought the cops for control of americas cities
9344437 three of the elder statesmen of comic books neal adams joe kubert and stan lee have joined forces to combat what they see as a real world injustice the men are lending their talents to tell the tale of dina gottliebova babbitt who survived two years at the auschwitz concentration camp by painting watercolor portraits for the infamous nazi dr josef mengele some of the artwork also survived but it is in the possession of the auschwitz birkenau memorial and museum in poland now 85 and living in california mrs babbitt wants the artwork back but the museum has steadfastly refused to return it

9344439 matt groening is known as a huge alt comics fan totally still engaging with new work coming out and he is someone who i have seen around at different conventions and local places a lot i knew he would like the ideas behind the book i found it out odd that despite doing a great weekly strip for years and years he never comes up much in alt comics conversation and never seems to be asked to be in anthologies much i told him about the book and he happened to have an idea for a very dense single panel cartoon that he was unsure how he was going to run in the paper at the usual space they give him so it was perfect timing
9344440 i dont want people digging into my personal desk diary i would rather have the work speak for itself i read a funny interview with
9344441 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
9344442 i think its one of the stupidest moves that a cable company can make
9344443 to deny your customers true unlimited downloads when their service is already capped at a download speed without a throttle
9344444 in a weird way i like having guys on second and third
9344445 it makes me more focused i just stuck to my game plan and just tried to hold them off
9344446 youre supposed to keep the same mentality like it was a tie game

9344454 singulair is a really effective drug that has been on the market 10 years and has been taken by millions of patients
9344455 in over 40 placebo controlled trials no reports of suicide in singulair treated groups have been found
9344456 the evidence is good but we couldnt call it perfect
9344457 when you dont know what to look for its pretty sad
9344458 he began talking about losing the desire to practice medicine even though it was a great passion of his
9344459 for a guy who was such a family man to do that in a way that would basically ensure his family would be the first to find him was completely baffling
9344460 neurontin is an important medicine that has helped millions of patients with serious conditions
9344461 based on an extensive review of our clinical trial data for neurontin we see no evidence to support the claim that neurontin causes an increased risk of suicide related events
9344462 even though a drug is identified as a drug for weight control or smoking cessation or asthma these drugs often also get into the brain so there is always the potential for having psychiatric side effects
9344463 but we dont have any unifying hypothesis as to why very different classes of drugs have psychiatric side effects
9344464 i cant see any reason why it should not be widely and regularly used during drug development
9344465 it has been validated and appears to be a technique that is not expensive
9344466 there is no compelling reason to think that more than a few are associated with suicidality

9344471 in a pluralist multi cultural society the state should promote tolerance and recognition of different values and beliefs given the dangers of segregation and the importance of community cohesion we need schools that welcome all and are committed to non discrimination schools should promote a culture of questioning of knowledge of respect and of exploration of values where students develop their own identities and sense of place in the world we believe all state funded schools should 1 operate admissions policies that take no account of pupils or their parents religion or beliefs 2 operate recruitment and employment policies that do not discriminate on the grounds of religion or belief 3 follow an objective fair and balanced syllabus for education about religious and non religious beliefs whether determined by their local authority or by any future national syllabus or curriculum for re 4 be made accountable under a single inspection regime for re personal social amp health education pshe and citizenship 5 provide their pupils with inclusive inspiring and stimulating assemblies in place of compulsory acts of worship and we commit to work with each other locally and nationally to turn public support for inclusive education into a campaign for reform that the government cannot ignore
9344472 but its precisely the fact that they are discriminatory that makes them catholic or anglican or jewish or muslim
9344473 a catholic school in which the children are drawn impartially from all religious groups and none in which the staff from the head down are no more likely to be catholic than agnostic is simply not going to be a catholic school period it will simply be a school which happens to have a funny religious name and which has a distant historical connection with the catholic church by virtue of having been established by an order of nuns or whatever it will be impossible for such a school to have what is fashionably called a christian ethos because believe it or not such an ethos is not some sort of free floating quality which happens to attach itself to a church school
9344474 i seldom agree with councillor lord tony greaves but when cllr greaves said that he believed gordon brown and the government dont care about either pendle or east lancashire

9344478 the individual who purportedly executed the agreement alleged in the sac did not have the requisite authority to do so
9344479 there was no meeting of the minds and or mutuality of obligation consequently there was no valid enforceable agreement as alleged in the sac
9344480 its axiomatic that given that the nondisclosure agreement is what the lawsuit is about we want to ere on the side of caution and not talk about a nondisclosure agreement
9344481 i just think that it makes no sense that since the lawsuit is over a breach of the non disclosure agreement then one ought not to comment about a nondisclosure agreement
9344482 the players look forward to it and i think everybody in the state looks forward to it
9344483 we are disappointed by cus decision as we believe the series ultimately belongs in denver

9344487 you can see two ways as far as an opener you can get one that maybe is a little easier than going out against a bcs school but this is a perfect game to play this is as good a setting as there is in college football and it would be a shame if we ruined it
9344488 the government should create investment conditions that allow city capital to flow into efficient energy technologies that can be delivered in short order

9344490 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9344491 our focus is really on this side of the river
9344492 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side

9344496 i think harper is in a position of weakness he looks ahead and sees change coming in the united states he sees the economy softening he sees a recession coming he possibly sees a deficit accumulating
9344497 this is a government that promised it wouldnt tax income trusts and broke the promise that devastated the savings of a million canadians this is a government that promised it was going to give us more childcare spaces which matters to every canadian family i dont see a childcare space out there
9344498 this is not an election about stephane dion this is an election is about stephen harper do you have enough faith he will not break promises again
9344499 we have to make sure we listen to all canadians those who make their living pouring diesel into tractors for example those make their living pouring diesel into boats my sense is that its important that we listen to the people who produce our food

9344502 a green mp sitting in the house of commons it will now be impossible to exclude the green party from the televised leaders debates in the next election

9344505 the bus driver provided a couple of warnings before asking the youths to get off while one of the youths was leaving the bus she punched the driver in the face seconds later she re entered and punched the driver two more times she and four other youths fled the scene on foot

9344507 the municipal classification framework set out in subsection 17 1 of the local government act determines the majority of classes on the basis of population except in situations where a municipality covers an exceptionally large area for its population where a municipality of any population has a population density of less than five residents per hectare it is to be classified as a district
9344508 once the population of westside reaches the requisite density the lieutenant governor in council may use the authority under section 18 to bring the municipalitys classification into alignment with the general scheme
9344509 therefore the committee felt because they were contentious and bringing division to the community they should be excluded from the discussion
9344510 you could not have glenrosa you could not have shannon lake or lakeview heights what im saying is that could also exclude gellatly or boucherie or green bay
9344511 it will create a different kind of division with people feeling disenfranchised especially after we have closed the process and submitted all of these names its going to create more concern in my opinion with people asking why the process was run this way to begin with
9344512 the rider was taken to penticton hospital and had subsequent surgery for fractures the driver of the van was not injured the horse had minor injuries and required stitches

9344539 bei timo haben wir versucht darauf zu reagieren was di resta macht da die beiden eine hnlich performance hatten
9344540 ich kenne die situation wenn man im jahreswagen sitzt und sein eigenes rennen f hrt
9344541 ich hatte einen sehr hohen puls da ich mich so aufgeregt hatte ich musste mich dann selbst beruhigen
9344542 man versucht den jungs die information zu geben dass hinter ihnen auch noch ein rennen l uft und nicht nur zwischeneinander
9344543 das ist aber in dem moment nicht so ganz angekommen
9344544 wir brauchten eine strategie die ihm erlaubt relativ lange ungest rt zu fahren
9344545 wir brauchten eine strategie die ihm erlaubt relativ lange ungest rt zu fahren wir wu ten wenn es uns gelingt seinen zweiten boxenstopp optimal zu timen dass er kurz vor dem jamie rauskommen m sste
9344546 ich wu te wenn ich frei fahren kann dann werden auch meine rundenzeiten gut sein
9344547 die reifen waren schon am ende aber ich habe versucht alles zu geben
9344548 die strategie war etwas falsch gelaufen normalerweise h tte ich vor den beiden mercedes rauskommen m ssen
9344549 da habe ich viel zeit verloren in dem ich mit beiden k mpfen musste
9344550 hier ist es wirklich sehr schwer zu berholen mein berholman ver war auch nicht ganz ohne
9344551 der siebte platz ist ganz zufriedenstellend aber der sechste platz w re dringewesen
9344552 ich bin zu sp t auf spengler aufgelaufen und da waren meine reifen nicht mehr so gut da ich einen sehr langen letzten stint hatte
9344553 die strategie war gut obwohl wir sind beim ersten stopp sehr fr h reingekommen

9344577 wed be up to our waist in water here and it would be navigable
9344578 you could come out here with boats all the fishermen would be up and down with their fishing gear and pulling in the catch
9344579 but this is the middle of winter and it looks like a desert
9344580 this area is on the very brink of environmental collapse
9344581 you see the lack of birds and the lack of life you smell it you can smell the water if you walk out into the lake bed you can burn your feet because of the acid sulphates
9344582 its very real and its happening right in front of us
9344583 to see my parents on the day that the animals left all they could see was everything that weve worked for for 30 years going down the track its also my future going down the track
9344584 we could have held on but we did it for the benefit of the cows we just didnt want to put them through it the cows spent more time dealing with the salt in the water than producing milk
9344585 we managed to unify the railways shortly after federation but its taken us a century to do anything about water and its still extremely difficult because the water in those river systems is over allocated its a 130 allocation and that was in a good year
9344586 so when were facing a really serious water deficit there just isnt any water any more
9344587 we are now looking at a situation where we could either have an aral sea or a series of acid lakes the options we have shrink by the week because theres less water in the system look things are really grim
9344588 this technology significantly reduces fuel oil and natural gas consumption
9344589 we really think this is a game changer for the renewables industry
9344590 its going to get us through the peak of the day by using excess energy at night
9344591 das ist nicht das resultat das wir uns erwartet hatten
9344592 ich f hlte mich wegen der verletzung berhaupt nicht wohl
9344593 und ich konnte nicht so pushen wie ich mir das vorstelle wir haben probleme mit der front aber das liegt vor allem an der fehlenden trainingszeit alle anderen bridgestone fahrer verwendeten eine andere spezifikation daher glaube ich dass in dem bereich noch etwas drin liegt
9344594 er musste sich in den vergangenen wochen so vielen herausforderungen stellen dass er ziemlich niedergeschlagen ist
9344595 es ist immer hart wenn man sich von einer verletzung erholen muss aber er wei dass er das hinter sich lassen und den kopf hochhalten muss er kann n mlich viel mehr das wissen wir
9344596 john und ich lagen die meiste zeit eng beisammen ich musste mich ganz sch n anstrengen aber ich konnte ihn hinter mir halten
9344597 wir haben heute wirklich ein sehr spannendes und sehr unterhaltsames rennen erlebt die dtm hat gezeigt was sie bedeutet was sie wirklich kann
9344598 timo hat zwar formal einen clean sweep von der pole position ins ziel gehabt er ist auch das ganze rennen eine sehr gute pace gegangen aber er hat immer paul di resta mit ganz hnlichen rundenzeiten bei sich gehabt der druck war das ganze rennen da und wenn er einen ganz kleinen fehler gemacht h tte w re paul sicher vorbei gewesen und dann h tte alles anders ausgeschaut
9344599 mattias ist ein ganz tolles rennen gefahren vom siebten auf den dritten platz mit einem tollen speed und nat rlich auch mit einer sehr sehr guten strategie
9344600 danke f r die unterst tzung die geholfen hat hier so viele zuschauer her zu bringen sie haben ein tourenwagenrennen gesehen das sicherlich werbung f r diesen tourenwagensport darstellt
9344601 wir wissen dass neun punkte zwar sehr wohl etwas sind aber ganz sicher nicht ausreichen um sich zufrieden zur ckzulehnen die meisterschaft ist so kompetitiv dass man in jedem rennen ganz vorn mitfahren k nnen muss um am ende vorn zu sein
9344602 any country that has a potential separatist movement will view the events in georgia through its own unique prism
9344603 but the greatest cause for concern lies in the ukraine azerbaijan and moldova all states that border russia
9344604 by illegally recognizing the georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia dmitry medvedev russias president made clear that moscows goal is to redraw the map of europe using force
9344605 we have our western friends and those in central asia who are not in agreement with russian actions but we also have a strong relationship with russia
9344606 the georgian conflict isnt likely to have a direct effect on the emergence of new separatist or secessionist movements but it has the potential to create a long term precedent

9344621 there is evidence that the increase in vtec cases may be linked with record rainfall this summer and use of private well water after periods of heavy rainfall well users are advised to consider boiling water intended for consumption or taking other appropriate measures
9344622 this is particularly important if vulnerable people such as children the elderly or immunocompromised persons are drinking the water especially if the water colour changes or it smells or tastes differently

9344626 i do not do newspaper ads i do not do open houses
9344627 referrals and the internet provide almost all of my buyers
9344628 our group sold 16 million worth of property in 2006
9344629 and we sold 26 million in property in 2007 a bad year by most anyones measure it is the internet that has enabled us to do this and it is our compasssearch subscription that has brought us much of that 10 million increase
9344630 we regularly field inquires from service people stationed in iraq
9344631 as their tour ends or if they are to receive major medical attention many of them are routed to san antonio
9344632 my local knowledge enabled me to set her fears at rest and to help her select a comfortable and safe neighborhood near the place she will be working all online
9344633 the doctor is flying here to meet with me and to buy a 300 400 000 home well be looking at the field of available properties we narrowed down to three and she will choose one of those i have them pre qualified and i am looking forward to meeting her after all this e mailing and excitement
9344634 ive done this so often that i know people are very comfortable sharing this information and i believe it helps bond them with me as their real estate professional
9344635 i explain some of the questions in advance like why i ask about children for example i also explain to them should they send me a house they found online if i think they should not buy that house and why
9344636 people arent offended if you spend time with them and seek to answer their questions then try to narrow down their price range i have found that opening with that line can offend people and send the wrong message that i am only interested in a sale you see i am really interested in my client and i feel every one of them is a part of my extended family
9344637 i dont want to sell them a home that i wouldnt want back to sell again
9344638 if i wouldnt be proud to list the home i surely dont want one of my clients buying it if you havent been able to tell yet i am very motherly i treat these kids as my own and anyone under 50 is a kid to me
9344639 we added two new associates at the end of 2007 to help handle the leads
9344640 were up to five selling and one administrator now we are closing about 90 of these leads
9344641 we also use the webreportertool to show listing prospects our internet savvy and success they are extremely impressed when i show them how much we sell through the internet and what people online do to find their listing on my site
9344642 i also spent the money to have a professional virtual assistant work with my site and make it more consumer friendly
9344643 with the virtual assistant handling the consumer friendly part and compasssearch handling the seo friendly part i feel confident that my success will continue my compasssearch subscription put another 200 000 in my personal take home pay last year a great return on the investment
9344644 get yourself a good template website and hook up with compasssearch the website alone didnt produce great results until i added the search subscription thats all it took me and i cannot tell you how happy i am with the results
9344645 i like learning something new every day talking to people from all over the world giving house tours online understanding what makes my site work and being number one on the major search engines when people come looking in san antonio i have the confidence that we will do even better this year and so far we already have i can tell you that no kind of lead is as good as the ones i get from my own website except a personal referral i strongly advise everyone to cut back on newspapers spend a part of that money on your website and be free from the doom and gloom that pervades the media about housing today people are still buying and selling homes its just that they are doing it online now you need to be found online by internet buyers
9344646 to answer your question does my website bring me new clients heres what my team and i have written in contracts that were from the website just this week 690 000 to close june 15th 350 000 to close may 30th 339 500 to close may 30th working a 250 000 130 000 200 000 at this time closing a new home 300 000 may 15th from a website client sold in 2007 referred to me in fact we have several of those this year so far so i guess i could yes my website brings me new clients daily

9344651 ramainya shalat tarawih itu biasanya pada hari pertama hingga 10 kami berharap dengan adanya tajil ini dapat mendorong adanya umat muslim untuk beribadah di sini

9344653 hidup tidak hanya secara fisik tetapi nurani dan moral sangat penting untuk dibersihkan meski sulit membedakan nilai dakwah dan kepentingan kampanye di bulan ramadhan masyarakat pasti bisa menilai siapa yang hanya mengejar kedudukan

9344655 dari waktu ke waktu tidak ada perkembangan berarti untuk mengurangi ketergantungan pangan impor itu justru sebaliknya malah makin parah

9344664 i think for the first game we came out with a ton of energy against a really good team in ohio
9344665 the freshmen stepped up and played a really big role today the number one thing was the energy they put forth from the get go and that they werent nervous or intimidated

9344727 except that we are dealing with a regime that having failed finds no one in front of it but the brotherhood who are helpless the brothers are people of religion and people of character the love of the people for them is proven over the past two weeks they security forces entered all the bookshops that some brotherhood members own and destroyed them taking the books and the cameras and other material why i hope this question is directed to the interior minister to the members of the state security and to the regime and to president hosni mubarak we are at the beginning of the holy month when people turn to books and to reading

9344731 what the brotherhood is circulating springs from a desire to draw public opinion to their side
9344732 otherwise where are the books that the police confiscated where is the prosecution that is questioning those arrested where are those bookshops specifically they stir media bubbles to get the sympathy of the people in them after they were exposed before public opinion because they no longer have anything to offer to the people

9344812 anak laki laki saya yang berusia 8 tahun tidak pernah merapikan mainannya sehabis bermain mainan baju piring sepatu semuanya dibiarkan begitu saja sesudah dipakai saya lelah berteriak
9344813 anak saya yang berusia 14 bulan sering sekali menggigit saya saya coba mengalihkan perhatiannya tetapi dia tetap tidak berhenti menggigit dan saya merasa takut dan khawatir dia akan mulai menggigit orang lain
9344814 tidak boleh menggigit lalu keluar dari situasi ulangi setiap kali gigit menggigit terjadi dengan melakukan trik yang sama bila bayi kecil anda menggigit bayi lain cepat cepat dekati si korban agar anak anda mengerti bahwa menggigit tidak baik
9344815 anak saya yang berusia 2 tahun tidak mau pakai baju setiap malam dia selalu menarik pampersnya sehingga pagi pagi saya selalu mendapatkan boksnya basah dan piyama serta pampersnya di sudut boks
9344816 mama sudah membuat kamu marah tetapi kamu tetap tidak boleh makan permen ini
9344817 pada saat sedang melakukan sesuatu anak perempuan saya yang berusia 7 tahun melamun kemana mana memutar botol shampo di wastafel atau menulis dengan menggunakan marker di dinding kamar makan apa yang harus saya lakukan

9344821 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9344822 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9344823 we dont want to solicit a bunch of canned goods that cant get there or you know bottles of water where they already have water
9344824 the thing that i am always concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether we are drawing resources away from folks on the ground
9344825 la situaci n no ha cambiado nada siguen las negociaciones sigo queriendo marcharme del real madrid quiero jugar en el chelsea
9344826 el presidente y pedja mijatovic me dijeron que puedo salir pero schuster no porque ha prometido que va a recuperarme si piensa eso es su problema no quiero seguir en el real madrid
9344827 calder n dijo que si recibieran una buena oferta me dejar an irme el chelsea ha hecho un gran esfuerzo
9344828 mi representante ha ido mil veces a hablar con el club y el club no ha mostrado inter s en que me quedara ahora como el club no ha logrado fichar nada interesa que me quede
9344829 me recuperar porque soy joven no me negar jugar tengo contrato si me hiciesen jugar lo har a aunque no estar contento

9344836 lo sentimos bien es un peleador muy fuerte le metimos unos golpes muy duros nunca busqu el nocaut esper que la pelea durara m s me sent muy fuerte y bien preparado
9344837 ya est cerrado firmado un contrato con ellos s lo falta la confirmaci n el lunes si es el 1 o el 8 de noviembre en los angeles no pod amos anunciar algo que faltar amos al respeto al p blico y a sasakul
9344838 ten amos que hacer algo para ponernos en carrera y coger confianza
9344839 generamos m s ocasiones pero fallamos en el puntillazo final se encerraron hasta con nueve hombres atr s y as es dif cil
9344840 lo he sabido al terminar la carrera cuando me he bajado de la moto
9344841 porque realmente todo lo ha llevado mi representante y yo no he estado demasiado al tanto de las ofertas que hab a
9344842 saber d nde voy a estar el a o que viene
9344843 trabajar con m s calma en lo que resta de temporada para seguir probando cosas y apuntar referencias con vistas tambi n al a o que viene
9344844 si doy el salto lo importante es hacerlo con un equipo competitivo y con el apoyo de la f brica quiero hacer las cosas bien hechas
9344845 es un jugador de alto nivel y es una gran responsabilidad no s si conseguir hacerle olvidar pero espero suplir las necesidades del equipo
9344846 ten a otra idea del f tbol galo lo cierto es que estoy muy contento de volver a espa a intentar aportar lo m ximo al equipo
9344847 el f tbol espa ol favorece mis caracter sticas en francia me cost un poco aunque di bastantes asistencias y acab marcando goles
9344848 abierto ofensivo que intenta buscar el uno contra uno con pase que tiene definici n un poco de velocidad y espero sacar lo mejor de m mismo
9344849 la plantilla es m s o menos la del a o pasado la primera vuelta de la temporada pasada estuvieron arriba y espero que se puede repetir
9344850 la situaci n no ha cambiado nada siguen las negociaciones sigo queriendo marcharme del real madrid quiero jugar en el chelsea
9344851 el presidente y pedja mijatovic me dijeron que puedo salir pero schuster no porque ha prometido que va a recuperarme si piensa eso es su problema no quiero seguir en el real madrid
9344852 calder n dijo que si recibieran una buena oferta me dejar an irme el chelsea ha hecho un gran esfuerzo
9344853 el comportamiento de los dirigentes del chelsea fc que a pesar de conocer perfectamente la decisi n de no traspasar al jugador han continuado realizando gestos y manifestaciones que han llegado al extremo de vender camisetas del jugador a trav s de su web oficial
9344854 todo lo cual no ha hecho sino enturbiar la situaci n y confundir a la opini n p blica
9344855 no hay nada de malo con confirmar p blicamente nuestro inter s por un jugador cuando el club involucrado est bien al tanto ha recibido dos ofertas y est negociando su venta as que refutamos toda cr tica del real madrid
9344856 sobre lo del portal el real sabe que fue un lamentable accidente hecho por una empresa ajena a nosotros el cual fue rectificado apenas nos enteramos y no se vendi una sola camiseta
9344857 mi representante ha ido mil veces a hablar con el club y el club no ha mostrado inter s en que me quedara ahora como el club no ha logrado fichar nada interesa que me quede
9344858 me recuperar porque soy joven no me negar jugar tengo contrato si me hiciesen jugar lo har a aunque no estar contento
9344859 jugar en la liga premier de inglaterra es el sue o de toda una vida que finalmente se hizo realidad con mi traspaso al manchester city
9344860 porque es un jugador joven y ganador con una medalla ol mpica de oro que lo demuestra pero lo m s importante es que aporta un gran balance
9344861 optimizar en el l mite del reglamento todo su material
9344862 obsesi n por el minimalismo era s lo un reflejo
9344863 los organizadores desean que esta pr ctica no se desarrolle
9344864 en todos los controles efectuados durante o despu s de la carrera kilian ha tenido un comportamiento ejemplar
9344865 me ha dicho que formo parte de la historia y le he contestado que no que l s que es una parte de la historia no yo
9344866 estar al ritmo de valentino y stoner es dif cil pero volver al podio es extraordinario
9344867 ha sido un fin de semana dur simo porque estoy tan cerca de casa tan cerca mis fans que me ha costado mantener la concentraci n pero quer a ganar aqu porque es mi casa
9344868 i woke up and my e mail was just going crazy
9344869 and then when it was announced it was like you couldnt breathe
9344870 its so satisfying as a conservative woman when she walked out on that stage there was just this moment it was really emotional for a lot of us
9344871 i was in the rules committee with about 150 people in the room they had tvs set up and we took a break to watch the announcement for a second after she came out it was silent then there was a gasp and everybody stood up and started cheering and clapping we stayed standing the whole speech
9344872 there were 10 or 12 women party stalwarts in tears using napkins and handkerchiefs
9344873 there is an electricity going through the social conservative crowd right now its unbelievable
9344874 especially given all the set ups and head fakes its amazing a lot of people were sure he was going to show his more moderate colors
9344875 my wife knew nothing about this woman but she was in tears listening to her articulate the views she had
9344876 dozens of e mails and the phones have been ringing off the hook
9344877 they were taunting me saying mccains going to disappoint you
9344878 finally we can get 100 percent behind the republican ticket change we can believe in
9344879 you know ive had my problems with mccain but he has reached out a hand to us both at the nra annual meeting earlier this year and with the amazing selection of sarah palin as his running mate
9344880 while barack obama wants to ban ar 15s palin shoots ar 15s and apparently pretty well
9344881 every shooter every hunter every gun owner every competitor needs to understand that it is time to in the words of bruce willis cowboy the f up
9344882 well be able to have some fun contrasting not just mccain and obama but biden and palin
9344883 shes great on our issues and bidens been terrible for 35 years
9344884 palin could play strong in the sporting states like michigan ohio and pennsylvania depending on how they use her
9344885 most pundits will underestimate her appeal in these key areas because they dont know her and they are unfamiliar with the sporting scene but among sportsmen authenticity counts and palins got that and then some
9344886 ive talked to two prominent social conservative leaders in the past 24 hours who told me they had previously not planned to attend the convention but were now coming to minneapolis after the palin pick
9344887 one scrambled to find a hotel room and is coming tomorrow the other rearranged his schedule and is flying in wednesday i got a call this afternoon from an evangelical business leader who told me he was contacting the mccain campaign and offering to host a fundraiser with his friends for mccain sans the candidate before the thursday deadline when mccain shifts to the public financing system i dont know if ive ever seen a veep pick energize the grass roots like this
9344888 contrast that to obamas bitter clingers obama just lost blue collar white democratic voters in pennsylvania and other states
9344889 the choice is to shore up the conservative pro drilling base
9344890 this is an aggressive on offense pick not a defensive pick
9344891 alhamdulillah saya secara pribadi enggak ada masalah walau bercerai tapi tali silaturahmi tetap jalan seperti saat ini
9344892 es un jugador joven y ganador con una medalla ol mpica de oro que lo demuestra pero lo m s importante es que aporta un gran balance
9344893 jugar en inglaterra es el sue o de toda una vida que finalmente se hizo realizad con mi traspaso al city
9344894 no me sorprendi ser titular porque hab a trabajado para ello
9344895 antes del encuentro en la ma ana del s bado el entrenador me pregunt si estaba bien preparado para jugar y yo le dije que s
9344896 me sent como en casa es lo nico que puedo decir ya que es complicado hacer valoraciones tras haber jugado s lo un encuentro afortunadamente todo sali bien estoy contento por mi papel y por el del resto del equipo
9344897 la nica palabra que se me ocurre es est pido
9344898 ambos entr bamos paralelos en la recta y a la hora de trazar la curva simplemente me he metido por dentro sin mala fe
9344899 en cada maniobra intentaba jugar sucio conmigo si l compitiese con deportividad yo har a lo mismo pero lo que pasa es que a veces hay que poner la raya y decir basta si l lo hace yo tambi n
9344900 con los dem s pilotos de la parrilla no tengo ning n problema s lo con l
9344901 tiene las mismas virtudes que van der vaart es un excelente jugador para ser el n mero 10
9344902 al parecer tiene una rotura fibrilar en la r tula que no le impide correr pero le molesta mucho al golpear el bal n
9344903 necesitaba la victoria y es algo excelente pero no estoy contento por lo que le pas a mikko ya que lo estaba haciendo muy bien y fue una buena batalla
9344904 pero es una carrera y a veces estas cosas pasan
9344905 la situaci n no ha cambiado nada siguen las negociaciones yo sigo con la misma idea de marcharme del real madrid quiero jugar en el chelsea se lo he dicho al presidente directivos mijatovic y al entrenador por en sima vez lo digo ante la prensa todav a el entrenador piensa que me puede recuperar pero mi cabeza est en el chelsea
9344906 schuster no es mi padre es mi entrenador no me va a obligar a hacer nada est mirando sus objetivos y yo el m o hasta ahora no ten a ning n problema con l el presidente y pedja mijatovic me dejan salir el club est de acuerdo conmigo pero schuster no porque se ha comprometido a recuperarme si piensa eso es problema suyo no quiero seguir en el real madrid
9344907 me ha molestado que desde mayo mi padre y mi representante hayan intentado renovar mi contrato pero el club pensaba fichar a cristiano ronaldo y no ten a tantas ganas de renovarme
9344908 no fue una ni dos ni tres veces las que mi representante y mi padre fueron al club a renovar han ido m s de mil veces y el club tampoco se interes mucho por mi permanencia no tengo nada contra cristiano me parece un excelente jugador pero tengo mi valor y mi orgullo ahora como el club no ha conseguido fichar mi salida es un problema tengo mi orgullo y mi intenci n es salir
9344909 el club dijo que volvieran en septiembre cuando se cierran las negociaciones
9344910 antes pens que estar a diez a os pero no es posible y ahora tengo ganas de salir
9344911 el problema es que el club no ha conseguido fichar a nadie
9344912 quiero aclarar las cosas porque me llaman pesetero y no saben lo que ha pasado verdaderamente llegu al presidente con una propuesta del chelsea me dijo que si la propuesta era buena me dejar a salir estaba seguro de fichar a otro jugador pero ahora como estamos al final y no han fichado a nadie no quieren dejarme salir
9344913 si tengo que estar una a o sin jugar lo estar me recuperar porque soy joven tengo 24 a os y es el destino
9344914 no me voy a negar tengo contrato si me hiciesen jugar lo har a aunque no estar contento
9344915 el chelsea ha hecho el esfuerzo m ximo ya he hablado con pedja y el presidente me dijo que me liberar an la nica persona que no me est dejando salir es el entrenador porque no le han fichado a nadie la afici n es una enamorada del club si me insultan bajar la cabeza y me quedar callado sin decir nada
9344916 la nica palabra que se me ocurre es est pido
9344917 deber a pilotar m s limpio llega un momento en el que hay que decir basta
9344918 such was his reputation that it was said his judgment on any piece of prose or poetry could make or break a writers career
9344919 neves tiene las mismas cualidades que rafael van der vaart es un jugador adecuado para jugar de n mero 10 estoy muy satisfecho con los nuevos fichajes que nos har n m s fuertes
9344920 alguien como jansen no necesita una fase de adaptaci n pero la experiencia muestra que los dos brasile os pueden necesitar medio a o
9344921 ante todo era un rato para m y estoy muy satisfecho pues fue un fichaje complicado
9344922 el madrid lleva 17 a os sin vencer siendo riazor el nico campo grande donde el capit n blanco nunca ha ganado
9344923 el presidente del real madrid ha reactivado la operaci n porque el valencia est dispuesto a negociar por 48 millones y que vicente soriano presidente del valencia sospecha que joaqu n tiene una oferta del madrid
9344924 el atl tico necesita dejar a un lado la champions
9344925 contador fue el favorito que m s perdi en la crono por equipos
9344926 el barca arranca la temporada en soria ante el numancia y en una macroencuesta realizada por el peri dico
9344927 el barca inicia la temporada con la misi n de reconquistar la liga con leo de crack
9344928 lorenzo tercero en la parrilla de salida ya est otra vez dando guerra
9344929 stoner pese a estar lesionado consigue su s ptima pole consecutiva por delante de rossi con el as quinto y pedrosa sexto
9344930 gaboriau cest lalchimiste qui a d couvert la pierre philosophale
9344931 trataba de estar tranquilo pero las emociones no me lo permit an
9344932 hemos tomado esta decisi n despu s de comprobar que no hab a buen feeling entre pedrosa y michelin
9344933 debe centrarse en el mismo criterio que ha sido totalmente ignorado
9344934 lamenta profundamente el comportamiento de los dirigentes del chelsea fc que a pesar de conocer perfectamente la decisi n de no traspasar al jugador han continuado realizando gestos y manifestaciones que han llegado al extremo de vender camisetas del jugador a trav s de su web oficial todo lo cual no ha hecho sino enturbiar la situaci n y confundir a la opini n p blica

9344936 ya lo he dicho al presidente ram n calder n al entrenador bernd schuster a los dirigentes a los medios tengo la cabeza en chelsea quiero jugar all
9344937 el club ha mostrado poco inter s para que permanezca en l
9344938 pero no es mi padre es mi entrenador no me va a obligar a hacer nada est mirando sus objetivos y yo el m o se ha comprometido a recuperarme si piensa eso es problema suyo
9344939 oh she is an optimist so she just sees potential

9344948 four out of the five rich men in this town
9344949 are common swindlers i suppose the proportion is pretty equal all over the world the fifth is a friend of mine and a very fine fellow and what is even more important from our point of view he owns a motor car
9344950 i am afraid we have hardly time for afternoon calls
9344951 if we ride on fast we must leave them behind for they are on foot
9344952 i was speaking with strict accuracy when i said that the soleil dor was the only place where one can get horses within twenty miles
9344953 i dont believe hed do it not with all that white hair
9344954 they must be at least a hundred strong for which reason we are all going to see my friend renard who has a motor car
9344955 but can you lend me your motor car now in two minutes
9344956 but god forbid that madness should in any way interrupt friendship let us go round to the garage
9344957 i say its a pity we havent got a light on this car if only to see by
9344958 from my best friend while our friend here was fighting with the steering wheel i ran up the front steps of the house and spoke to renard who was standing in his own porch you will remember i suppose i said theres no time to get a lamp he looked up blinking amiably at the beautiful arched ceiling of his own front hall from this was suspended by chains of exquisite ironwork this lantern one of the hundred treasures of his treasure house by sheer force he tore the lamp out of his own ceiling shattering the painted panels and bringing down two blue vases with his violence then he handed me the iron lantern and i put it in the car was i not right when i said that dr renard was worth knowing
9344959 there is only one set of lights that make me more cheerful
9344960 and they are those lights of the police station which i can see beyond the town please god we may be there in ten minutes
9344961 if you really think that ordinary people in ordinary houses are anarchists you must be madder than an anarchist yourself if we turned and fought these fellows the whole town would fight for us
9344962 the whole town would fight for them we shall see
9344963 it is not horses and it is not behind us
9344964 pray resume your remarks colonel you were talking i think about the plain people of a peaceable french town
9344965 might even call it unpleasant however i suppose those lights out in the field beyond this street are the gendarmerie we shall soon get there
9344966 they have two rows of armed men across the road already i can see them from here the town is in arms as i said it was i can only wallow in the exquisite comfort of my own exactitude
9344967 it is quite true there is a crowd or an army or some such thing across the end of that street
9344968 it must be something else a sham fight or the mayors birthday or something i cannot and will not believe that plain jolly people in a place like this walk about with dynamite in their pockets get on a bit syme and let us look at them
9344969 what did i tell you that crowds as law abiding as a cow and if it werent its on our side
9344970 of course the dear old boy has turned out to help us
9344971 that i am lying in bed at no 217 peabody buildings and that i shall soon wake up with a jump or if thats not it i think that i am sitting in a small cushioned cell in hanwell and that the doctor cant make much of my case but if you want to know what i dont think ill tell you i dont think what you think i dont think and i never shall think that the mass of ordinary men are a pack of dirty modern thinkers no sir im a democrat and i still dont believe that sunday could convert one average navvy or counter jumper no i may be mad but humanity isnt
9344972 you can believe in a sanity which is not merely your sanity and youre right enough about humanity about peasants and people like that jolly old innkeeper but youre not right about renard i suspected him from the first hes rationalistic and whats worse hes rich when duty and religion are really destroyed it will be by the rich
9344973 renard shall explain it he shall explain it to me
9344974 he will very soon explain it to all of us
9344975 he will never get anything out of that old heathen i vote we drive bang through the thick of them bang as the bullets went through bulls hat we may all be killed but we must kill a tidy number of them
9344976 the poor chaps may be making a mistake give the colonel a chance
9344977 the street behind us is held too in fact i seem to see there another friend of yours syme
9344978 i think we are going to smash into a lamppost
9344979 whatever all this pandemonium means i suppose the police station will help us we cant get there for they hold the way but theres a pier or breakwater runs out into the sea just here which we could defend longer than anything else like horatius and his bridge we must defend it till the gendarmerie turn out keep after me
9344980 there must be some people left in the town who are human
9344981 the human being will soon be extinct we are the last of mankind
9344982 what is all that at the end of the dunciad
9344983 what does it matter who is mad or who is sane we shall all be dead soon
9344984 no oddly enough i am not quite hopeless there is one insane little hope that i cannot get out of my mind the power of this whole planet is against us yet i cannot help wondering whether this one silly little hope is hopeless yet
9344985 the man in the dark room but sunday must have killed him by now
9344986 but if so he was the only man whom sunday found it hard to kill
9344987 i also am holding hard on to the thing i never saw
9344988 where is the colonel i thought he was with us
9344989 everythings gone im gone i cant trust my own bodily machinery i feel as if my own hand might fly up and strike me
9344990 do you see the cross carved on it and the flame inside you did not make it you did not light it better men than you men who could believe and obey twisted the entrails of iron and preserved the legend of fire there is not a street you walk on there is not a thread you wear that was not made as this lantern was by denying your philosophy of dirt and rats you can make nothing you can only destroy you will destroy mankind you will destroy the world let that suffice you yet this one old christian lantern you shall not destroy it shall go where your empire of apes will never have the wit to find it
9344991 let us charge these dogs for our time has come to die
9344992 mr syme i hardly think you understand your position i arrest you in the name of the law
9344993 are as i know for a fact members of the supreme anarchist council
9344994 deforestation has to fall more and the conditions for sustainable development have to improve
9344995 we gave him a couple of shots in philadelphia against lefties and didnt quite get the at bats i was looking for that could have to do with not playing for a while he might be pressing a little trying to catch up quick hes had a long time off
9344996 par son cort ge suivi de celui du ministre de lint rieur
9344997 en cours de route un coup involontaire est parti du pistolet dun policier et la balle a atteint la t te de evlo ev
9344998 si les responsables ne sont pas punis ces crimes deviendront une norme dans un pays qui a men une petite guerre victorieuse en dehors de ses fronti res
9344999 sil est de nouveau disculp cela veut dire que le premier ministre russe vladimir poutine et le pr sident russe dmitri medvedev sont incapables de remettre lordre dans la r publique et que lingouchie ne fait pas de facto partie de la russie
9345000 deforestation has to fall more and the conditions for sustainable development have to improve
9345001 i wanted the building to blend into its environment unobtrusively while making it very accessible to the public we mainly used natural materials such as wood natural stone and a grass roof the design is sturdy and subtle at the same time in this manner the city hall opens itself towards the entrance of the town and invites the public to enter
9345002 at the front the building establishes itself as a city wall with the office of housing corporation maasland marking the highest and most prominent point the back side where the building encloses a public square has a smaller scale appearance
9345003 the complex unites three very different tenants under one roof it has an open character and it blends into its historic surroundings
9345004 i have a feeling shell be doing most things on her terms
9345005 ich fasse mir an den kopf wie konnte er dies tun
9345006 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
9345007 whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whoever wishes to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it what profit would there be for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life or what can one give in exchange for his life for the son of man will come with his angels in his fathers glory and then he will repay all according to his conduct
9345008 in the past couple of years especially after we won this past championship every guy in school that thinks theyre halfway athletic wants to play football
9345009 making the team means a lot but its not life or death
9345010 it wont be like oh man i did it all for nothing because in the end its still going to help me because i play other sports
9345011 our games are packed you cant get into that field house because there are people everywhere
9345012 its under the spotlight you know youre playing for your school youre undefeated its the pressure its everything
9345013 apsal pakai seluar macam tu ko tahu tak peha ko tu besar macam farah fauzana

9345026 it just so happens that when you feed selenium to cows and they produce selenium enriched milk the selenium seems to be in a chemical form that is both highly absorbable into the body and also more effective in terms of preventing cancer
9345027 we are comparing the milk form of selenium with a yeast form of selenium in this human study and looking to see how readily the selenium gets into the body

9345030 we are looking for the preventative effect in healthy people and also watching for any potential side effects but so far have seen no evidence of any negative effects we will have been able to have reached an initial conclusion as to the likely benefits of selenium by december this year

9345459 isro has projected an ambitious programme for the next 20 years which addresses development of cutting edge technologies for interplanetary exploration human space mission advanced launch vehicles and spacecraft it was therefore decided that isro start its own academic institute to meet the demands for technological advancement
9345460 the idea was mooted sometime in november 2006 and within a short time the approval from the government was obtained and the institute was inaugurated on september 14 2007
9345461 we have set very high standards for ourselves and in the next five years we will not only be one of the top institutes in the country but also in the world
9345462 we have introduced new concepts of laboratory experiments which are related to real life problems we also have the advantage of access to all isro centres and their sophisticated labs
9345463 visit to various isro laboratories have helped us to interact with scientists and also involve ourselves in various projects
9345464 there we will have even better facilities including state of the art laboratories
9345465 you will get to hear a lot about us in the future dont be surprised if isro launches a satellite designed by our own students within a few years
9345466 iist was my first choice despite being eligible for admission to an iit because my aim was to make a career in space engineering
9345467 the best thing about our institute is the hands on experience we get in the laboratories i dont think even the students of the
9345468 we have a dynamic young and vibrant faculty drawn from all over india in the last one year many of them had presented papers in many prestigious journals and conferences all over the globe

9345478 a lot of people have this stereotype image of a goldfish with a three second memory and that s not the case at all
9345479 it is probably accurate to say that many fishes such as minnows sticklebacks and guppies are capable of the same intellectual feats as rats or mice
9345480 these experiments provide clear evidence that minnows increasingly rely on social learning as the basis for their foraging decisions as the perceived threat of a predator increases

9345487 the ability to reach out not just to government leaders but to the people of our allies
9345488 he will be able to communicate more effectively with the leaders of our allies and the people that this is their fight too i think that level of communication hasn t been forthcoming from president bush s administration they have been preoccupied with iraq which is not a conflict that has a lot of popular support i believe that one of the things he will bring to the challenge of bringing more resources to afghanistan is clarity of where the serious issue is it is along that afghani pakistan border this will be a priority with president obama
9345489 the british have done extraordinarily well both in afghanistan and iraq i have seen them in field i was very impressed by their professionalism as a much smaller force they re under even greater pressure than the us military
9345490 bt has not approached mahindra and mahindra m amp m and there is no indication of a formal process all one can say is that they could be contemplating selling at some stage

9345494 we used state of the art insar satellite data to constrain the dike source and that allowed us to demonstrate the existence of the slow earthquake motions recorded by the gps stations on kilauea s flank
9345495 these slow earthquakes are an interesting phenomenon that has only been studied within the last decade and we re still trying to figure out how they fall into the bigger picture of earthquakes
9345496 they re definitely a part of the earthquakes cycle and trying to understand how they relate to other earthquakes and how they may be generated and triggered will give us greater insights into how predicable earthquakes are
9345497 india ranked first in the official team rankings and was awarded the best team trophy
9345498 dear god i am very busy but i have a few things to discuss with you
9345499 politicians should change their attitude towards sports by ensuring their sincere participation in the promotion of games in the country
9345500 in us politicians not only take keen interest in sports but also keep an eye on each and every sport by ensuring their presence at the grounds people have started taking interest in sports in our country and if the trend continues then we will win more medals in london olympics
9345501 sports should be encouraged by providing quality infrastructure and latest equipment the government indian olympic association and other sports bodies have to play important roles
9345502 we lack quality coaches in india perhaps they are the best available but they should be sent abroad to familiarize themselves with the latest coaching methods
9345503 the fact is that we do not have competent coaches the foreigners are far superior our coaches are just good enough for the beginners
9345504 the biggest problem here is that for events like olympics or world championships you cannot really train under the coaches you have around here
9345505 though we are lagging behind in the race of sez set up but it is an amazing efforts that the goal was accomplished in less than 2 years of its inception
9345506 jaipur is becoming an exciting destination for the it ites industry raje has proactively put in place progressive policies and has invested in infrastructure to ensure rapid growth
9345507 the development of mustard hybrid would help enhance productivity of this second most important oilseed crop in the country according to him the new variety would contribute to bringing about self sufficiency in the edible oils sector

9345555 its a continuation of the investigation because of lingering concerns
9345556 fifteen to 20 years ago elders say you could scoop water from the boats and drink it and not be concerned

9345624 the sometimes painful adjustments faced by newcomers to new york city
9345625 scores of people it seems were reminded anew of the growing pains and delight that often go hand in hand with moving to the city readers comments ran the gamut from lonely newcomers who still felt lost to people who remembered their early days here with great tenderness

9345649 als ich mich das erste mal mit craig traf fragte er mich welche art von musik ich gerne h re
9345650 ich sagte ihm da ich wirklich auf die sachen von leuten wie jeff buckley damien rice und sarah mclachlan stehe ich liebe bedeutungsvolle songs mein dilemma war da ich in gospel chor und auch ein bi chen in opernmusik geschult wurde und sehr an diese gesangstechniken gew hnt war aber ich wollte mich von diesen stilen unbedingt etwas weiter wegbewegen
9345651 eine junge jazzs ngerin und songschreiberin von erstaunlicher reife und selbstsicherheit

9345657 wir schrieben f r das album einige songs mit denen wir musikalisch und stilistisch ein gewisses wagnis eingingen

9346068 ik ben blij dat ik het record van agostini evenaar voor de wedstrijd zag ik giacomo en ik heb hem gezegd dat ik alles zou geven
9346069 de titel het ziet er goed uit maar ik vier nog niet
9346070 ik wil real verlaten en zit met mijn hoofd al bij chelsea
9346071 ik mocht weg bij een goed bod en dat is wat chelsea gedaan heeft
9346072 als de trainer een speler tegen zijn zin wil houden is dat op zijn verantwoordelijkheid wat kan ik nog meer doen
9346073 de voorzitter zegt dat ik mag vertrekken maar bernd schuster wil me houden dat is echter zijn probleem want ik wil vertrekken

9346077 with the rising cost of utilities and food life is getting harder
9346078 its hard for the elderly and i feel for them
9346079 say you are in a grocery store and you want to buy more food but you dont have enough money
9346080 this is the same way we need more health care coverage but our pensions dont increase
9346081 theyre going to kill more people because people arent going to be able to afford to go to the doctor
9346082 mik je op een plaats net voor de plek waar de vlieg zich bevindt waardoor je anticipeert op wat hij gaat doen als hij de klap ziet of voelt aankomen
9346083 we waren verbaasd om te ontdekken dat een vlieg ruim voordat hij vlucht voor een klap al een hele reeks tamelijk ingewikkelde lichamelijke voorbereidingen treft
9346084 dit illustreert hoe snel een vliegenbrein de informatie kan verwerken die nodig is voor de gewenste motorische reactie
9346085 dat wil ook zeggen dat de vlieg visuele informatie van de ogen die het gevaar zien in een nanoseconde kan overbrengen naar de poten die bepalen welke houding nodig is voor een vlucht

9346097 palin brings the only executive branch experience to the republican presidential ticket
9346098 her leadership and insight into the nations energy crisis among other challenging problems facing all americans plus her commitment to reform will move our country forward
9346099 the selection of this great alaska governor will certainly bring about greater attention to the voices of the more than 900 000 asian and pacific islanders across the united states
9346100 but i read about it and i never stopped eating them now i believe it
9346101 we are at a point where there is a collaborative effort in mitigating the problem between us and our federal partners
9346102 we get three to five calls of complaints a month for them to come up with a monetary offer is an indicator that there is a big problem
9346103 we have neighboring island residents that come to guam and some of them arent aware of guams regulations of the turtles because it is legal where they are from
9346104 they are unaware that the turtles are against the law to possess or hunt
9346105 there are more turtles which are found dead than alive
9346106 we are living in a society where people think that it is ok to take these endangered species
9346107 but what the people do not realize is the long term effects of taking these turtles residents need to be aware that when they do such an act they are actually doing more harm in conserving the animals the culture and environment
9346108 they get excited to see it and are tempted to take it home to cook
9346109 also for some catching and cooking turtle is a learned tradition from their elders which they continue to embrace despite its illegality
9346110 with all this back and forth about what should be in the law and what shouldnt be in the law we should come to an agreement and do whats right and stop wasting the taxpayers money
9346111 it is time for change something that hasnt been for so long
9346112 i cant say whether im leaning to the left or the right because ive got nothing to lean on
9346113 its sad that i have to send my children to the philippines for a good education this is a u s territory the philippines are a third world nation but they have a better school system
9346114 it seems to me that if the current administration has been in office since then and its taking this long to get our taxes then we definitely need a new administration
9346115 all of these senators that are sitting in the legislature are businessmen

9346120 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9346121 as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need
9346122 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9346123 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9346124 bushs job is to figure out a way to pass the torch in a way that does the least damage
9346125 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9346126 he knows its not his convention hes had two of them and hell behave accordingly
9346127 these last few days i saw that agostini was a little unhappy today though i saw him smile he came to greet me wished me well and i won
9346128 we have a 75 point lead which means that up to now weve been very strong weve never let up and more than everything weve kept our heads held high even during difficulties
9346129 this year i told myself that to beat stoner we needed the best valentino i tried to bring him out although youre never sure to find him i think ive found him and im happy
9346130 i got away well but pedrosa overtook me and i lost a lot of time
9346131 stoney was flying then i got back up to my starting place i saw him fall and then things went well for me
9346132 a lot of people in the activist community are really on pins and needles about whos next
9346133 our organization will continue we will be on the streets

9346136 the american people are anxious the american people are worried because they recognize that over the last eight years this country has gone tragically off course
9346137 if youll believe with me then i promise you this we will not just win ohio we will win this general election and you and i and joe biden we will change this country and change the world
9346138 when your mothers maiden name is finnegan and youre going to dublin and youre appearing at the home of the shamrocks it kind of feels right
9346139 i watched a guy tap into just by his very being and his ideas tap into the age old american belief that many have forgotten
9346140 and that is you dont have to accept a situation you cannot bear you can change it
9346141 ive waited a long time to have a president who is smarter than i am

9346146 i think it will be possible to obtain the green light from brussels because this rescue will be done without the help of the state be it for the former or the new alitalia
9346147 it will be entirely a market operation because a private group is acquiring the shares alitalia has declared insolvent
9346148 less about obama and more about mccain but the contrast will be apparent
9346149 he will try to accomplish both goals reaching out to undecided voters while also reassuring the base
9346150 thats the art of leadership to be able to do seemingly contradictory things
9346151 knows exactly what the democrats are doing who their vice presidential candidate is what their convention message is
9346152 that will frankly after watching that for a few days help unify the republican party but i dont think it is a question of unifying the republican party
9346153 part of what people will be looking for is is he tuned in about their concerns about the economy jobs energy costs the costs of health care
9346154 sen mccain has already demonstrated that he is not a continuation of the bush agenda and approach on so many issues
9346155 ive already told the president ramon calderon and coach bernd schuster management and the media my head is there at chelsea i want to play over there
9346156 until now ive never had a problem in the locker room at real
9346157 the problem is that real madrid did not manage to recruit
9346158 schuster isnt my father hes my coach he cant make me do anything

9346168 i served with hillary clinton i know hillary clinton hillary clinton is a friend of mine you sarah palin are no hillary clinton
9346169 for two months kacy practiced with the school team the crusaders at new creation center a private christian academy in mcdonough she participated in drills and even played a scrimmage game aug 23
9346170 he said she cant play simply because shes a girl
9346171 we didnt want to have the game game gummed up with a story line
9346172 we wanted to keep it really clean and tight a zombie apocalypse
9346173 he said that when he was defense secretary he felt he was presiding over a huge grinding machine that was here before me and will be here after im gone
9346174 there was almost something wistful about it a sense that even in this day and age no one not even someone whos had a career like that of cheney can really hope to fundamentally reshape our institutions
9346175 if someone said that your vice president is like dick cheney i dont know if thats something you would want or not
9346176 i dont run anything im not its not like being secretary of defense when i had 4 million people working for me
9346177 and hes been absolutely true to his commitment to me
9346178 which was id have an opportunity to be a major participant in the process to be part of his government to get involved in whatever issues i wanted to get involved in
9346179 we dont always come to the same conclusion by any means
9346180 if you were to say who is the unluckiest person i know in the world
9346181 said ted kaufman bidens chief of staff for much of his first 22 years in the senate
9346182 if you were to say who is the luckiest person i know in the world
9346183 youd have to have a head of steel not to want to help this guy
9346184 youd go for a period where everything seemed ok and then hed come in some days and youd want to cry for him he looked as if the accident had just happened hed get this despair
9346185 when he went into the campaign in 87 he was known as a great orator
9346186 there was no skepticism about what it was he said
9346187 i have a much higher iq than you do i suspect i told him
9346188 and then i was off talking about my college degrees and awards my place in my law school class i didnt feel any better afterward what id said was a quick and stupid rant that i wished id never said worse than that without realizing it id exaggerated my academic record
9346189 he has a deep conviction and pride in the work he does so failure doesnt always bother him
9346190 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
9346191 it may be possible because i speak so bluntly that people misunderstand
9346192 she wouldnt have articulated one coherent policy and people would just be fawning all over her
9346193 tony and i looked at each other and it was like this isnt about policy or alaska issues this is about peoples most basic instincts i like you and you make me feel good
9346194 it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9346195 the people of alaska many of them got tired of the ego issues out there with longer term federal and state officials and said enough is enough
9346196 without a very large contingent of democrats supporting her positions she cant get anything accomplished
9346197 come on over unless you have a problem with small dead animals
9346198 i know this sounds hokey but basketball was a life changing experience for me
9346199 its all about setting a goal about discipline teamwork and then success
9346200 she took butchered crab portions and arranged them in a basket for cooking
9346201 that caribou has had a good life its been free out there on the tundra not caged up on a farm with no place to go
9346202 some of the things im doing its obvious im not running for miss congeniality
9346203 shes just been able to get in with issues and get press on it and she knows sort of what the public wants to hear and has been able to place her positions around those sort of issues that are important to people here the values that are important to people here
9346204 i dont think you can underestimate her as a politician
9346205 many people will express sympathy but you dont want or need that because trig will be a joy you have to trust me on this
9346206 its gender its age its kind of the maverick being from the outside
9346207 my personal feeling is it is much better for the party if mccain is out there asserting the direction and overall future he wants to define for the country that gives republicans something to vote for as well as independents and democrats
9346208 mccain can make the argument that obama is a cotton candy candidate sugary and pleasing but it melts on contact and you cant live on it
9346209 one man has been prepared his whole life to lead the nation the other barrack obama is simply just not ready
9346210 the aba is actively engaged in discussions with treasury the regulators and others to help ensure that any action by treasury to support the gses
9346211 i note your comments on going paperless and its benefits for cost reduction one of the basic equations for which we had to be able to provide the math proofs in economics is that in a competitive industry cost minimization equals profit maximization in the long run it amazes me how the real estate finance business has never fully appreciated this

9346214 mijn coach had gezegd dat ik moest zwijgen omdat ik anders zou verliezen
9346215 ik heb staf naar de ploegdokter gestuurd en dan beslist om hem niet te laten starten
9346216 het heeft niets met doping of verdachte bloedwaarden te maken
9346217 helemaal niet er is niets geheimzinnigs aan er was een probleem waardoor staf conditioneel niet in staat was om in de ronde van spanje mee te rijden
9346218 details kan ik niet geven maar als staf dat zelf wel wil doen heb ik er geen probleem mee
9346219 maar hij is te ontgoocheld om meer uitleg te geven
9346220 ik had een probleem met mijn knie en had daar ontstekingsremmers voor genomen
9346221 maar die zijn mij heel slecht bekomen vooral aan mijn maag het deed heel veel pijn en ik deed niet anders dan overgeven ik heb lang met de dokter gepraat maar er was geen oplossing
9346222 ik wou wel starten maar ik kon de dokter niet overtuigen ofwel zou mijn maag blijven opspelen ofwel zou mijn knie erger worden zonder die ontstekingsremmers
9346223 cofidis wou gewoon geen risico nemen ik wou me onderscheiden in deze vuelta maar zie die kans nu dus door een klein probleem verdwijnen

9346233 however the plan is to transfer the propane fuel to another truck that vehicle will not be moved until the propane is moved
9346234 es evidente que un buen dem crata deber a inclinarse siempre por la transparencia pero como las elecciones se ganan por la cantidad de votos obtenidos y no por la calidad de discernimiento de los votantes elegir un tipo u otro de discurso queda a expensas de la catadura moral de cada cual
9346235 peoples opinion of obama seems to be a little less positive and of mccain a little more positive its at the margins but ohio is going to be decided at the margins
9346236 he should be getting more traction he should be ahead by 8 9 12 maybe even 15 points
9346237 this has to do with mccain my feeling is that in the last two weeks maybe three mccains campaign has been working like a swiss watch its amazing somehow everything feels good about it including the ads they are masterful

9346239 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
9346240 many lawyers ive spoken to now view the invitation of content so if you have a comments section at the end of an article on a newspaper site they view that as inviting comment and therefore you are responsible for it and therefore you probably want to consider pre moderating all the content that goes there
9346241 it is likely that the courts will focus on whether or not a publisher reviewed content rather than the form of the publication
9346242 it isnt likely to make any difference whether or not it is an invitation to comment or a bulletin board they amount to much the same thing if the comments are not moderated the publisher is probably safe at least until notified of any allegedly defamatory posting

9346244 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9346245 the economic stimulus package that i signed earlier this year is having its intended effect
9346246 many americans who received tax rebates are spending them businesses are taking advantage of tax incentives to purchase new equipment this year and there are signs that the stimulus package will continue to have a beneficial impact on the economy in the second half of the year
9346247 there are families across our country struggling to make ends meet
9346248 there is an understandable concern about the high price of gas and food and many americans are worried about the health of our housing and job markets i share these concerns about our economy

9346254 all i do is get into the gym and work and when they have a fight they tell me i fight anyone

9346256 as i go round the country heads tell me how difficult it is to get rid of weak teachers
9346257 as i go round the country heads tell me how difficult it is to get rid of weak teachers
9346258 they say they start the procedure and they might be 18 months down the line and the teacher will move
9346259 we need to be thinking of ways of preventing that that isnt ofsteds role but i sympathise with head teachers about that

9346264 of the 42 recessions from 1802 to the present 2002 39 of them or 93 percent have been preceded or accompanied by declines of 8 percent or more in the total stock returns index historically a bottom in the market has led a trough in the business cycle by about five months investors will have little luck predicting market upturns and downturns because turning points are usually identified months after theyve occurred not beforehand in the meantime theyll miss out on significant gains from the bottom of the market to the end of the recession the stock market has risen an average of about 24 percent emphasis added

9346280 my choice by far was mitt romney i think a lot of good people were passed over with good experience such as tim pawlenty mike huckabee and tom ridge palin became a governor after i left office so i dont know her i only know what i see on tv i thought the other choices had a great deal of experience and thats going to be needed senator mccain is 72 years of age and somehow we have someone thats 44 with no experience in terms of foreign policy shes been a governor for about a year and eight months now shes been a mayor in a small town but the president has the right to pick the individual that he or she wants so he made the decision

9346285 someone who has fought against corruption and the failed policies of the past
9346286 someone who has reached across the aisle and asked republicans democrats and independents to serve in government
9346287 it would be hard not to appear conservative with the huge budget approved by the majority
9346288 i thought she showed some guts in doing that and really irritated some folks
9346289 ok youve got valley trash standing here in the middle of nowhere
9346290 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9346291 in the role of governor she should be pursuing a transportation policy that benefits the state of alaska rather than pandering to the southern 48

9346298 look honey it even has a hot tub and look at the view of the ocean wow just incredible
9346299 let me freshen up a bit first why dont you get ready for bed

9346301 naked except for a jaggedy arse balaclava and ran into the lounge aaaahhhh giant ants are eating my head
9346302 began making unwanted and disruptive statements over the air on channel 2
9346303 a mi trabajo acudo y con mi dinero pago el traje que me cubre y la mansi n que habito
9346304 i was following an 18 year old lady on the northern beaches when the vehicle for no reason crossed to the wrong side of the road and collided head on with a truck
9346305 she was killed instantly and we believe at the time she was using a mobile phone to text or talk to somebody
9346306 it only takes that one moment of lack of concentration
9346307 police are more inclined to issue a ticket because the legislation has been around so long that everybody knows they are doing the wrong thing
9346308 i have no sympathy for people if they get caught by patrolling police
9346309 there is evidence to say it is just as bad as drink driving
9346310 if we have reasonable cause to believe the person was on the phone or there is a mobile phone located in the vehicle we will do a check on it
9346311 certainly when we are looking at collisions involving inattention the mobile phone is our number one suspect
9346312 please keep bulk head doors closed when not in use
9346313 de omgevingslucht en de rookgassen en andere stoffen in de lucht kunnen zodanig opwarmen dat de ruimte spontaan kan ontvlammen en in een grote vuurbal kan veranderen
9346314 als u besluit te blijven staat u er alleen voor
9346315 dit is de moeder van alle stormen hij wint nog elke dag aan kracht ik weet niet of we al iets dergelijks hebben meegemaakt
9346316 u moet bang zijn u moet bezorgd zijn u moet uw kont reppen om uit new orleans te vertrekken nu onmiddellijk
9346317 i love my job as kids always amaze me with their brilliance audacity or stupidity depending on their mood
9346318 whats the deal with you directing a music video thats cool but so random
9346319 i am absolutely on board by the way what is a treatment
9346320 when im sixty i dont want to look back at a life of amazing things i might have done
9346321 oh btw just kidding about midnight sun im still writing it
9346322 no more twilight movie and screw everyone who wanted to see it
9346323 a solid image of families whose lives are measured in small and large moments sometimes historic sometimes mundane leaves critics with nothing to fight about
9346324 her body language that sparkling smile expressive hand gestures all helped loft her speech to summits of high eloquence as she delivered her crucial headline grabbing message in wave after wave of galvanizing scorn for the politics of john mccain and electrifying support for barack obama
9346325 hillary clintons was a huge speech and i have no doubt that when i reflect on the more impressive convention speeches that ive heard in 30 years this will rank among the most memorable
9346326 in walking through the center from the tennessee delegation down to florida over to new mexico and new york everyone appeared to be ready to work together to win the presidency in 2008
9346327 while he didnt bust out with pie charts and 10 point plans he laid out in no uncertain terms the choice we as americans face this year
9346328 im one of those crazy chicks that wants to see what is actually being said in the speeches not the pundits talking about their impressions of what is being said
9346329 as historic as this event is america is late coming to the party
9346330 the folks ive talked to in denver are coming back with a huge smile on their faces
9346331 so now is the time for presiden barack obama its time we need him the world needs him the politics of business as usual has got to end because its killing us and by us i mean america
9346332 the main thing about clintons speech last night that sticks with me is how very very young we still are as a nation and really how rapidly change happens
9346333 although this campaign wont be easy we could well be on the verge of a political realignment that could last for years
9346334 his choice of 44 year old one term governor is going to make it a lot harder for mccain to effectively hit obama on the whole
9346335 so after criticizing obamas inexperience mccain picks someone with even less experience
9346336 o nce the novelty wears off i dont see women moving en mass to see roe v wade overturned
9346337 w hy has this entire race become about girl parts
9346338 john mccain made a stupefyingly wrong headed strategic mistake today by naming sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate
9346339 its just too effing bad that the job has fallen to the republicans because the democratic party threw women under the bus
9346340 i also think its interesting that this election marks the end of a long line of southern administrations no matter who wins there wont be a southerner among them
9346341 with the choice of sarah palin as his vice presidential candidate john mccain has done what democrats could not this election is now about him and his decision making ability and how long he can live
9346342 unfortunately this abuse of power stemming from religious fanaticism and closed mindedness continues across the globe in many fashions from shooting up a church to modern day crusades
9346343 lets note that if participation in government health insurance programs have increased that means people cannot afford to pay for private insurance
9346344 crafton is playing around with other peoples money which pretty much disqualifies him from criticizing
9346345 this is quite simply a giant middle finger to every american suffering without health insurance the mccain camp does not think that there is a real problem and intends to do nothing to help correct it
9346346 heres a clue if its too easy and money is involved youre not doing it right
9346347 whats truly reprehensible is that a corporation like sinclair will misuse the public airwaves to spread lies and deception to further a political agenda

9346401 go to bed roll around and remember thats all i can offer you tonight
9346402 you cried and not because you had the fuck of a lifetime not because you came six seven nine times all over me like thunderclaps

9346409 and then i could bury myself all the way inside you until i got good and gone and lost

9346420 there has been a great deal of suspicion over the years about what is going on with these plants
9346421 he is a man of the cloth and so a lot of people dont want to think badly of him but frankly if someone has a huge crop of cannabis in their back garden its highly unlikely they are just sitting there admiring its horticultural properties

9346423 but over the last 12 months the picture changed strong operating momentum is now propelling genuine operational growth despite u s economic weakness
9346424 acquisitions and cost cuts have accounted for most of ibms growth in recent years in the 10 years ended 2006 sales increased at an annualized rate of less than 2 and the company lost both market share and in uence
9346425 however sales growth has accelerated in each of the last three quarters and per share pro ts have risen at least 23 in each period consensus estimates trending upward over the last month project per share pro t growth of 24 in 2008 and 11 in 2009
9346426 a broad business mix has helped the company keep growing during the economic slowdown ibm may still be best known for its hardware but the companys strength over the last year has stemmed from the services and software businesses which tend to be less economically sensitive than hardware
9346427 hardware accounted for about 18 of sales in the six months ended june while services represented 58 and software generated 20 financing operations brought in most of the last 4
9346428 while the current economic climate has pinched the consumer companies are still investing heavily in new technology
9346429 in the june quarter ibm signed 14 7 billion in service contracts up 12 increasing the services backlog to 117 billion nearly twice annual services revenue
9346430 software revenue jumped 15 in the six months ended june services and software growth more than offset a 2 decline in revenue from the systems and technology unit which produces servers and other hardware
9346431 ibm is also benefiting from its strong presence overseas particularly in emerging markets foreign sales accounted for 63 of 2007 revenue a percentage likely to increase in coming years
9346432 emerging markets such as brazil russia india and china which combined to post a 31 sales gain in the june quarter represent a strong growth opportunity for ibm the company is investing heavily in the four huge countries as well as in eastern europe and the middle east
9346433 management expressed concern about economic weakness in some of the worlds largest developed markets including the u s but that worry has been factored into growth expectations
9346434 ibm targets per share pro ts of 10 to 11 in 2010 representing annualized growth of 12 to 16 from 2007 levels given its growth prospects the stock seems attractively valued at 13 times estimated year ahead earnings below the ve year average forward p e ratio of 15
9346435 energy producers have shut in approximately 77 of oil output and 37 of natural gas production in the gulf of cvx
9346436 nearly 1 million barrels of daily oil production is now shut down the last time this happened was in
9346437 the price consequences could be even worse this time due to oil and gasoline inventories that are lower than when hurricanes katrina and rita hit any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9346438 destroyed more than 100 oil platforms and damaged several refineries
9346439 found that the s amp p 500 has averaged a total return of 14 1 per year under democratic presidents since april 1945 and 11 8 under republicans the best total returns 17 4 per year were under bill clinton whose presidency ranked first in economic results
9346440 that 1 14 point difference if maintained for eight years would yield 9 33 percent more income per person which is a lot more than almost anyone can expect from a tax cut
9346441 when democrats were in the white house lower income families experienced slightly faster income growth than higher income families which means that incomes were equalizing in stark contrast it also shows much faster income growth for the better off when republicans were in the white house thus widening the gap in income and median income grows 3 percentage points faster
9346442 when negotiating the pipeline the russian foreign minister told me we know you and we do not like what you are doing they were not pleased that the btc bypassed russia and secured a transport route for oil from azerbaijan through georgia to turkey
9346443 if the russians were to attain a dominant influence in georgia they could interfere with the pipeline from an economic standpoint by raising transit fees
9346444 if the nato ships continue to stay in the black sea after the expiration of 21 day period then i would like to remind you that turkey would be responsible
9346445 turkey is our nato ally and should have been more supportive of their american allies this brings back the bad taste of turkey barring american troops from going into iraq through turkish ports and turkish territory in 2003 a step that vastly damaged turkish american relations id hoped we were putting that behind us

9346463 were in gustavs path and the salaried employees have been told they are essential which means were supposed to be at work during the worst of the storm
9346464 anyone who doesnt want to be at the newspaper when a hurricane hits the town they cover isnt much of a journalist overtime thats the last thing anyone should be thinking about its a calling people
9346465 i have to wonder if this is what gannett had in mind when they sent all those people to video training if this is the future of journalism lord help us all

9346484 it is odd that a million baptists of the south can furnish only three men for all of china odd that with five hundred preachers in the state of virginia we must rely on a presbyterian to fill a baptist pulpit here i wonder how these things look in heaven they certainly look very queer in china

9346492 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9346493 obama can lead the nation at a time of crisis sarah palin cannot
9346494 in choosing sarah palin john mccain has subjected the nation to an unnecessary risk at the very time when america can least afford to take unnecessary risks
9346495 reflects the bare minimum that could be done for a former president
9346496 you cant give him a podium because people will draw the conclusion
9346497 i wouldnt let him within 100 miles of the convention center because it would be used by an unscrupulous republican party that doesnt care about the truth in character assassination against our candidate
9346498 michelle spoke last night barack is going to speak thursday night and the other two nights are for the clintons

9346500 he has spoken at a number of these things in the past
9346501 he hasnt shown respect to israel and many of the jewish constituencies here based on the things he has done
9346502 i think its hard to ask a political party to take a former president and say were not going to hear you at all
9346503 the party is very sensitive to the american jewish community and its very sensitive to ever conveying that this is anything but a pro israel party

9346508 in light of the tone of sir paul stephensons statement i am now extremely concerned for my personal safety and those close to me including family and supporters alike
9346509 the message from gordon from alistair from colleagues like myself has been the same
9346510 we have had a very good period of economic success which has for sure provided us with a very serious platform to weather this
9346511 the safe quality drinking water that they expect and deserve
9346512 i understand that the company is in the process of upgrading the treatment works which is involved in this outbreak
9346513 i will be calling for the company to get its other remedial works done as quickly as possible
9346514 its no good waiting until people are ill they have to be given the warning to boil their water and take precautions themselves
9346515 we have a grandmother living here my mother in law and shes very fragile so im concerned as to how that would affect her
9346516 and also of course theres all the boiling of the water theres seven of us living in the house
9346517 prompted us to take this precautionary measure to protect public health
9346518 further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals
9346519 these 30 odd hours or more will be me concentrating on what happened in the second half
9346520 they had one bit of brilliance and we had two bad mistakes so put that together and you get the result
9346521 i thought the game was terrific in the first half
9346522 it was end to end but i thought we were alright and playing some good stuff
9346523 we were quite comfortable and i didnt see that coming in the second half
9346524 the passing of the ball was half decent by both sides but its all about brilliance which is what mendes did
9346525 the permit granted on the 8th was given at the request of mr cgs stevenson the private secretary to lord halifax who telephoned to say that the secretary of state wished that all possible facilities should be granted to mr bryans
9346526 lonsdale bryans met lord halifax on 25 august 1939 that he should travel to europe to make contact with enemy groups opposed to hitler lord halifax is reputed to have said that britain would not fight for danzig and the polish corridor and later to have minuted that he was impressed by the proposal
9346527 the main point which seemed to emerge from the interrogation was that according to anderson lonsdale bryans was a personal friend of lord brocket and also claimed to be something in the nature of an unofficial envoy of lord halifax he wished to see hitler and with this in view had asked anderson to get in touch with a certain stahmer that bryans would be vouched by a number of persons including those on the list
9346528 with reference to our conversation yesterday afternoon with regard to the case of john lonsdale bryans i attach a copy of a letter which this individual wrote to the director of the schwartzhaupter verlay leipzig evidently offering to make a trip to germany for the purpose of an audience with the fuhrer
9346529 in writing this letter bryans has of course been guilty of an offence under the defence regulations dr4a in the he has attempted to communicate with the enemy but i certainly agree with your view that in the circumstances of the case the suggestion that we should request the admiralty to intercept the portuguese vessel on which bryans is now travelling from funchal to lisbon is not practical
9346530 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve him bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities offered to him to get into italy
9346531 in the circumstances we feel that he might be left at large though of course be strictly watched
9346532 bryans is becoming desperately short of money and although no mischief has been done so far i anticipate the possibility that he might try to sell his story the press it occurs to me that it might be a good idea to warn lonsdale bryans as seriously and solemly as possible that he should not go on telling people of how he contacted the germans
9346533 bryans story would make sensational reading in the daily mirror

9346612 people across the nation struggle with the idea of building a bridge because theyve been under these misperceptions about the bridge and the purpose said palin who described the link as the ketchikan areas potential for expansion and growth palin said alaskas congressional delegation worked hard to obtain funding for the bridge and that she would not stand in the way of the progress toward that bridge 8 8 06 we need to come to the defense of southeast alaska when proposals are on the table like the bridge and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something thats so negative palin said

9346627 although the benefit is of moderate size there is an impact on a range of outcomes including the composite of cardiovascular death myocardial infarction and strokes as well as cardiovascular hospitalizations given the large proportion of people who are unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor the use of telmisartan would be clinically important

9346630 the physician can take the time to test the patient to determine what kind of bacteria she has
9346631 we found that youre not going to put the patient at a disadvantage if you start her on antibiotics while you wait for culture results then switch her to more powerful medication if she has mrsa

9346646 governor palins lack of experience especially in national security and foreign affairs raises immediate questions about how prepared she is to potentially succeed to the presidency that really is the only criterion for judging a candidate for vice president
9346647 in palin who is just halfway through her first term as governor mccain has found an ardent opponent of abortion rights who wont provoke the outrage from social conservatives that might have greeted a more experienced pro choice candidate such as former pennsylvania gov
9346648 in picking a first term governor with no foreign policy record the republican presidential candidate undermined his own central themes experience and national security and exposed the deep fault lines within his campaign
9346649 but as this newspaper noted earlier this week the most important question in evaluating a vice presidential pick is whether that person is prepared to step into the oval office palin with no national political experience and only a couple years in the alaska governors office is a very tough sell for the republicans on that score mccains age he turned 72 on friday doesnt help

9346684 my mom who really idolized my dad had the effect on us of kind of idolizing him
9346685 it is easy to mistake mccain a rich septuagenarian with houses beyond number who does not use e mail or what president bush once called the internets and who hums bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb iran to the tune of a beach boys cover of a song written the year barack obama was born but john mccain is an eager cold eyed politician who has sought the white house for a decade compromised and reversed himself and believes he is an actor in a grand unfolding saga he is also more comfortable with shades of gray than he appears a sense of nuance rooted it seems in an early life in which he at once revered his father and felt sorry for him
9346686 i became aware i think when i was either in my very earliest teens or even before that that my father had a struggle with alcohol and i watched him fight and fight this sickness so i not only idolized him but i also understood that he had flaws like all of us and probably his greatest was his struggle against alcoholism which made him a very religious man he prayed every night on his knees he was very religious because he saw hell combating alcoholism a struggle that he knew he could not successfully win by himself
9346687 i just didnt have the inclination i could tell early on i of course went to happy hour i of course had drinks with my squadron mates et cetera but i never felt any particular appetite for alcohol im sure the example of my father may have had some kind of effect
9346688 i never saw anybody work as hard as john mccain did to try and restore his reputation

9346690 the republicans will do their best to match the democrats soaring rhetoric
9346691 is more about who is the best dream merchant make no mistake both candidates and both parties have dreams to sell or more accurately they have different versions of the same dream the american dream in the end the election is likely to go to the candidate who best argues his dream is the more authentic and his approach the most american
9346692 has finally assumed the leadership of the conservative movement by disavowing the same rebellious tradition he once cherished to date in his challenge to barack obama he has run an entirely conventional conservative republican campaign but while the attacks may prove effective they hardly feel subversive dramatic or new
9346693 even the choice of sarah palin a reliable social conservative and tax cutter
9346694 is less interested in being dramatic for the sake of principle than he is in being dramatic for dramas sake
9346695 selected a potential leader of the free world who knows little or nothing about the major issues of the day beyond energy
9346696 politics like all professions isnt as easy as it looks palins odds of emerging unscathed are slim in fact shes been all but set up for failure
9346697 possible that palin is so talented that she will prove to be the face of the gops future more likely this hail sarah pass wont do much to help john mccain get into the end zone hell win or lose for other reasons
9346698 mccain has a code combining a religious concern for the weak and the oppressed with a military conception of national honor an almost roman belief in personal integrity and sacrifice for country
9346699 a stubborn sense of decency and morality that should appeal broadly to protestants roman catholics jews and others who are concerned about social justice

9346704 is more about who is the best dream merchant make no mistake both candidates and both parties have dreams to sell or more accurately they have different versions of the same dream the american dream in the end the election is likely to go to the candidate who best argues his dream is the more authentic and his approach the most american
9346705 selected a potential leader of the free world who knows little or nothing about the major issues of the day beyond energy
9346706 politics like all professions isnt as easy as it looks palins odds of emerging unscathed are slim in fact shes been all but set up for failure
9346707 possible that palin is so talented that she will prove to be the face of the gops future more likely this hail sarah pass wont do much to help john mccain get into the end zone hell win or lose for other reasons
9346708 has finally assumed the leadership of the conservative movement by disavowing the same rebellious tradition he once cherished to date in his challenge to barack obama he has run an entirely conventional conservative republican campaign but while the attacks may prove effective they hardly feel subversive dramatic or new
9346709 even the choice of sarah palin a reliable social conservative and tax cutter
9346710 is less interested in being dramatic for the sake of principle than he is in being dramatic for dramas sake
9346711 this shock to the system has the capacity to alter the already fragile psychology of the consumer
9346712 and make no mistake deducting the price of a pair of shoes directly
9346713 the government cant be in the position of paying any price that a manufacturer names there ought to be some kind of ability to set prices
9346714 that high income group is a very small percentage of the elderly there arent enough of them to make much of a dent if the goal is to save money
9346715 american consumers and businesses seemed to regard globalization and free trade as net positives the integration of china and the former soviet bloc into the trading system lowered inflation opened new markets and brought billions of workers into the labor force
9346716 but in this decade rampant growth in emerging markets has mercilessly boosted prices for energy and commodities competition from foreign workers has tamped down wage growth and the weak dollar has made u s companies vulnerable to foreign buyers as a result americans are now more inclined to see themselves as victims of globalization rather than as beneficiaries of it a los angeles times bloomberg poll this spring found that 50 percent of respondents said free trade hurt the economy while only 26 percent said it helped
9346717 its a disappointing and vulgar attack on john mccain who has devoted his life to the cause of freedom and the fight against tyranny
9346718 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative
9346719 said jeannette anaya a tijuana actress mexicos drug battles alter a way of life boston globe 9 hours ago we want to feel safe in the mexico of the future
9346720 i thought we were friends now i never want to see you again
9346721 i did but you sucked at everything so i had to take you out
9346722 holy shit your ass is fucking huge and whos fucking shorts are you wearing
9346723 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
9346724 aggressive near term actions would be required to alter the future path of human induced warming future generations will inherit the legacy of our decisions
9346725 right now the united states imports about 70 of its oil from overseas at the same time billions of dollars that we spend on all that foreign oil seems to end up in the bank accounts of those around the world who are openly hostile to american values and our way of life this costly reliance on fossil fuels threatens america and the world in other ways too co2 emissions are increasing global temperatures sea levels are rising and storms are getting worse
9346726 borrowing money from china to buy oil from saudi arabia
9346727 borrow ing money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
9346728 as i have said for many years throughout this land were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9346729 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9346730 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9346731 wont even follow bin laden to the cave where he lives
9346732 you were right about her clearing the field if she gets in
9346733 but you were wrong in thinking dianne would pick gavin newsom as her replacement in the senate if she won
9346734 dont you know who diannes best friend is in washington
9346735 but i still think she would make a good president
9346736 right now in the second week of may 2006 we are facing perhaps the worst gas crisis in history
9346737 we have way too much gasoline gas is down to 19 cents a gallon and the oil companies are hurting i know that i am partly to blame by insisting that cars run on trash i am therefore proposing a federal bail out to our oil companies because hey if it were the other way around you know the oil companies would help us
9346738 i think he brought it to a new level of attention and validity that we hadnt had before
9346739 al gore has been warning us of the dangers of climate change for more than twenty years
9346740 when al won an academy award for his fine documentary an inconvenient truth i was thrilled america was finally listening to the lecture hed given me every week for eight years
9346741 he had written a great book before he was chosen as vice president
9346742 its easy to take shots its part of being a public figure and being in public office you catch a lot of arrows
9346743 al gore knew more about the importance of the rain forest than the scientists
9346744 i asked him a couple of questions and he began a tutorial flying 30 000 feet over the rain forest he told us how the important the rain forest was to the environment and how it affected weather patterns i didnt know that stuff it was one of those life changing moments that ill never forget
9346745 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9346746 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9346747 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9346748 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9346749 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9346750 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9346751 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9346752 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9346753 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9346754 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9346755 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9346756 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9346757 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9346758 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9346759 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9346760 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9346761 at the end of the day regardless of the paid army obama puts in west virginia when it comes down to issues like coal taxes pro life issues and gun rights mccain is right on the issues of concern to most west virginians
9346762 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
9346763 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
9346764 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9346765 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
9346766 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
9346767 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity and some assumed we would continue with both no matter the outcome but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9346768 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to facts their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short circuit the rule of law
9346769 we plan to take them with us we do not know what we will expect at sea we have had indications that israel might stop us but we know full well that the palestinians that are coming with us have the right papers have the right visas and they should be allowed to travel there is no reason why israel is holding them hostage holding them prisoners in gaza and denying them medical attention denying them education denying them family reunification
9346770 the suspicion would arise that someone in the us created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates they needed a small victorious war
9346771 we are in the process of re evaluating our relationship with russia and we are doing that in concert with our international partners such as france but also many others including germany and all of the nato countries its premature to say i dont know what ultimately will result from the process that people are going to discuss what the consequences may be
9346772 behold the great image of authority a dogs obeyed in office
9346773 youre dancin with whom they tell you to or you dont dance at all
9346774 and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us
9346775 i often get questions about impeachment at town hall meetings and ive often said i do not think that would be something that would be fruitful to pursue i think impeachment should be reserved for exceptional circumstances
9346776 in a stadium like this it felt like one living organism
9346777 people are really going to see which venue looks more like america and its this one
9346778 he thoroughly and compellingly explained his plan for change with specific distinctions between what government should be responsible for and personal responsibility
9346779 we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
9346780 i cant imagine why youd have a hard time making up your mind
9346781 its important to understand how our democracy works not just looking on television but to participate is important to me
9346782 i believe we wouldnt be in iraq in his administration mcnally said
9346783 i think you get the handlers in there and you just get lost
9346784 give a man a fish he eats for a day teach him to fish he eats for a lifetime
9346785 were corrupting more and more people to care about this stuff
9346786 para que me pedis consejos si lo vas a hacer como vos quieras
9346787 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
9346788 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
9346789 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
9346790 as a follow up to my below post picking a female vp makes it very difficult for obama to execute the second part of his strategy painting mccain as the same as bush
9346791 maybe they wont notice that i am taking john mccains straight talk express campaign themes
9346792 i dont think so america knows mccain just sold out the country for a politic tactical stunt the woman has no experience on diversity of economics no national experience with any issue if the 72 year old kicks the bucket so would we as a country this woman is soooooo under qualified
9346793 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses
9346794 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
9346795 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
9346796 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
9346797 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
9346798 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
9346799 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
9346800 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
9346801 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
9346802 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
9346803 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
9346804 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
9346805 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
9346806 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
9346807 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power
9346808 i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
9346809 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
9346810 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
9346811 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
9346812 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
9346813 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
9346814 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
9346815 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
9346816 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
9346817 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
9346818 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
9346819 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
9346820 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
9346821 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9346822 to put conservative values and conservative ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity
9346823 they had their chance they have not led we will
9346824 on occasion he rambled through excessive repetition bush is most effective in personal contact not a set speech
9346825 how and what we do for all of you the people who pay the taxes bear the burdens and live the american dream
9346826 cant understand how a guy like george w bush can be leading a guy with the kind of caliber experience and know how as al gore
9346827 make sure that our prosperity enriches not just the few but all working families
9346828 i believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning
9346829 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
9346830 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
9346831 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
9346832 the only time i ever saw my mother really angry was when she saw cruelty
9346833 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
9346834 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
9346835 hillary this time i cant go with you i got to go with obama
9346836 but im going to send you a check and i know that a lot of the women thats with you were not going to fall out were not going to disagree we are more intelligent than that
9346837 first will he campaign in tennessee second will our democratic leadership get behind obama and help him or run away from him like what happened with john kerry
9346838 the tennessee democratic party has got to stop running away from the national democratic party
9346839 have pretty much decided they cant do it win in tennessee
9346840 from each according to his ability to each according to his need
9346841 when they had most of my clothes off i felt a twinge in my right knee i sat up and looked at it and my right foot was resting next to my left knee just in a 90 degree position i said my god my leg that seemed to enrage them i dont know why
9346842 shes been around black churches all her life so reverend wrights anger filled message didnt surprise her
9346843 early on he was in search of his identity as an african american and more importantly as an african american man
9346844 how much did you spend on watches last year my dear friend rich tarrant gives me a bit better prospective sic on vermont pal google than sic and come out of the dark ages
9346845 why dont you take another moment to actually read my posts instead of projecting foolish notions onto me
9346846 god may help them who help themselves but for all the others
9346847 how much did you spend on watches last year my dear friend rich tarrant gives me a bit better prospective sic on vermont pal google than sic and come out of the dark ages
9346848 what it has to do with me as a person is i resent the fact that
9346849 four years before that al gore lost his home state to bush by about 60 000 votes
9346850 obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
9346851 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
9346852 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
9346853 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
9346854 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
9346855 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9346856 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9346857 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9346858 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9346859 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger
9346860 after they wrecked our economy its time for a change
9346861 after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change
9346862 powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9346863 barack obamas vision and his voice represent the best of america
9346864 it is that common american identity which barack obama exemplifies heart and soul that enables us as americans to speak with moral authority to all of the people of the world
9346865 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that that election didnt matter
9346866 when he walks out on stage tonight in front of 75 000 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
9346867 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
9346868 it was a very close election and certainly for a lot of people at that time who said theres no difference between al gore and
9346869 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress during which he showed courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country in a war that was popular when it started but later condemned by history
9346870 the experience that lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9346871 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land
9346872 he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity
9346873 gore compared obama to abe lincoln what a laugh abe was honest patriatic humble a great statesman obama is none of these obama is so very arrogant he reminds me of hitler
9346874 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9346875 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9346876 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9346877 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
9346878 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9346879 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9346880 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9346881 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9346882 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
9346883 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9346884 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9346885 it was definitely the longest speech ive seen him do and he did pull on a lot of heart strings
9346886 i would have liked to seen it more fact based but hes definitely leadership material
9346887 im a bit of an environmentalist so i really enjoy his movies and lectures he is a tad full of himself though
9346888 i really enjoyed governor schweitzer of montanas speech because he seems very down to earth
9346889 i really enjoyed hillarys speech as well talking about how her campaign and baracks campaign are about helping others it was really classy
9346890 he got over his personal conflicts with obama and stepped up and did what was right for the party and the country in typical bill clinton fashion
9346891 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
9346892 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
9346893 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
9346894 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
9346895 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
9346896 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
9346897 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
9346898 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security
9346899 the lunar infrastructure as proposed by the late gerard k oneill is well thought out
9346900 lastly i wanted to say that these figures are based on current residential demand
9346901 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
9346902 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
9346903 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
9346904 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
9346905 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
9346906 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
9346907 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
9346908 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
9346909 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
9346910 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
9346911 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
9346912 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
9346913 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
9346914 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
9346915 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
9346916 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery

9346918 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
9346919 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
9346920 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
9346921 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
9346922 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
9346923 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
9346924 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken

9346928 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
9346929 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
9346930 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
9346931 many seniors whether they are pensioners or self funded retirees are finding the cost of living hard to meet
9346932 it is simply recognising and saying thank you to seniors in this state and helping them with rising costs of living
9346933 this signals the return of competition in the banking sector
9346934 the banks have been slowly increasing their profit margins but this will bring them back in line
9346935 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weight loss and radical appearance change
9346936 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9346937 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare
9346938 and the environments in which appearance medicine programs are filmed are often highly artificial as most people dont have access to the same level of resources equipment personal trainers and chefs
9346939 given the dissatisfaction that participants typically express about themselves and their lives at the programs commencement the extreme psychological pressure that is created during filming and the difficulty of maintaining rapid weight loss it would be surprising if all participants and their families walked away unscathed
9346940 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
9346941 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
9346942 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
9346943 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
9346944 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
9346945 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
9346946 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
9346947 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
9346948 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
9346949 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
9346950 im completely free this is important i hope to find a good place a good bike for 2009
9346951 its a personal matter about me wanting to do well
9346952 i think i have the talent to get on the podium and to try to win but a realistic opportunity hasnt come yet
9346953 theres a lot of talking but we havent decided anything yet i think something more may be coming lets hope we can take a good decision for next year
9346954 i got a good start and although i got pushed a bit wide in the first turn i still thought id hold on to my position
9346955 but as i entered turn two the rear tyre was just not warm enough and i had a big slide i thought it was all over then but luckily i landed back on the bike and although i smashed the fairing with my leg no harm was done
9346956 i didnt quite have the pace that i have had this weekend which was probably due to the higher temperatures and we certainly slid around a bit more today
9346957 this is the first time we have raced with the new chassis and with the new construction front tyre that bridgestone brought here for us so with all things considered and from where i ended the first lap i think we had a good race
9346958 the tyres worked especially well and i did my fastest time on lap 25 out of the 28 it was just a shame i wasnt with the front group from the beginning or things might have been very different
9346959 it has been quite a hard weekend for me as we have been working a lot on the new chassis and getting it right
9346960 i really want to thank my team as they have all worked so hard to get it the best it can be i think maybe we changed too many things on the bike and lost our way a bit but at the end the bike seemed to work ok
9346961 this morning during warm up we went back a bit and then on the grid i had to change my front tyre and had to start with a new one that didnt have the right feeling to start with
9346962 he was pushing and at that point hed always take a very tight line also in practice
9346963 for sure he braked a bit too hard and he lost the front he slid while he was pushing hard and i was going more or less like him so he was trying to increase the lead
9346964 however as weve shown many times if we are in good shape especially in race trim we arent much slower than him except for two or three times i finished in front of him more often than he has
9346965 so maybe he tried to push a bit harder and he lost the front today the surface was a bit more slippery on that corner i too had some warnings
9346966 casey pushed a lot but he couldnt go far away from me
9346967 some laps i gained some laps i lost it was a long race and i dont know if it was possible to catch him but anyway i was happy because my settings were okay and when i saw him slide away i thought for the championship it was very positive for us
9346968 i felt nervous before the race because here at misano i have all my friends all my family only my dog didnt come
9346969 so it was difficult to keep the concentration there was a lot of pressure on my back always positive but i felt quite nervous because in practice we had struggled a lot with the settings also last year was very bad and we broke the engine after three laps
9346970 despite making an excellent start to the season and leading the world championship going into the german gp during the last few races dani pedrosa has made it know to both michelin and honda that he doesnt feel at ease with the tyres that michelin have offered him
9346971 honda and michelin believe that rider confidence needs to be at its maximum if the rider is to fully exploit the tactical potential of the tyres
9346972 in these circumstances michelin and honda have therefore decided not to equip pedrosa with michelin tyres for the remainder of the 2008 season
9346973 i thank michelin and honda for their mutual understanding and for agreeing to my personal demands
9346974 i am very conscious of the fact that i have made some excessively negative comments about michelin tyres even though michelin helped me make an exceptional start to the season
9346975 both honda and michelin hope that motogp world championship will continue with a multi tyre brand regulation in 2009
9346976 after the last race in hungary where we scored zero points i am really happy that team has now found a good way to work
9346977 salvador has made things very close in the championship this weekend
9346978 but this race has been good for my confidence after i made a big mistake yesterday the objective for le mans is to make some big progress
9346979 im happy to be here on the podium again four months after le mans the last race where we got it
9346980 but to follow valentino was very difficult and i had to take so many risks so i preferred to finish second and to gain the confidence that we havent had for the past three months
9346981 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
9346982 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
9346983 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
9346984 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
9346985 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
9346986 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
9346987 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
9346988 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
9346989 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
9346990 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
9346991 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
9346992 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
9346993 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
9346994 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
9346995 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
9346996 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
9346997 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
9346998 it is an honour to be the first japanese driver in the history of the wtcc
9346999 hopefully my knowledge of the okayama track which is new to the wtcc calendar can benefit the other three chevrolet drivers and help them in their races
9347000 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal

9347003 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
9347004 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
9347005 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving the climate crisis

9347008 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9347009 she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9347010 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade
9347011 the last thing women need is a president and vice president who are prepared to turn back the clock on womens rights and repeal the protections of roe v wade
9347012 when as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president and john mccain promises to appoint more scalias and thomases and end a womans right to choose it is time for a change
9347013 in an era when over 80 percent of downs syndrome babies are aborted the palins feel they have been extremely blessed by god to raise an absolutely perfect son
9347014 gov palin continues to use her testimony to advance protections for unborn children
9347015 will i get a nominee who will keep his word to me in the vetting process if any word is actually given
9347016 we all know that dance nobody actually admits they ask the roe question and the question doesnt get asked and it doesnt get answered and therefore the nominees get on the bench and they do what they want
9347017 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
9347018 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
9347019 we are facing a planetary emergency which is not like anything we have experienced in the history of humankind
9347020 the solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon based fossil fuels
9347021 we need to invest in innovation i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out to tackle that
9347022 now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning mandatory caps on planet warming carbon
9347023 the carbon based industries have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for all its worth
9347024 taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9347025 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving the climate crisis
9347026 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
9347027 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9347028 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
9347029 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
9347030 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9347031 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder forless
9347032 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
9347033 the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
9347034 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9347035 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9347036 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
9347037 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9347038 we cannot let the situation in the country go on like this samak said on his weekly television address to the nation
9347039 it must be over but i will not do anything that will create a bad atmosphere the announcement of an emergency decree would create a bad atmosphere in the country and to the world
9347040 you can express freedom but do not destroy this country samak said
9347041 what they the pad are trying to to now is overthrow the government they seized government offices airports is this democracy or is this is the peoples alliance to destroy democracy
9347042 the press expected that i will resign after the audience with the king he said
9347043 i told you before that i will not resign i will stay on to run this country
9347044 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
9347045 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
9347046 i knew abe abe was a friend of mine and baracks no lincoln
9347047 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
9347048 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
9347049 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
9347050 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
9347051 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
9347052 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
9347053 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
9347054 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
9347055 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
9347056 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
9347057 sandia national laboratories and stirling energy systems ses set a new solar to grid system conversion efficiency record by achieving a 31 25 percent net efficiency rate
9347058 the conversion efficiency is calculated by measuring the net energy delivered to the grid and dividing it by the solar energy hitting the dish mirrors auxiliary loads such as water pumps computers and tracking motors are accounted for in the net power measurement

9347063 the release of carbon dioxide is massive in this country
9347064 if al gore were truly concerned about carbon dioxide he would be clamoring for nuclear power plants al gore himself has already accumulated astonishing personal wealth during his campaign against world energy technology and is now a principal in a new corporation being formed to profit from public fear of global warming

9347066 god whispers to us in our pleasures speaks in our conscience but shouts in our pains it is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world
9347067 see to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on christ
9347068 see what happens when aliens breed with sheep no wonder they support the bill to help illegal aliens
9347069 is offering us the kind of vision and sense of urgency that has been so lacking in the presidential campaigns
9347070 if one started to use biofuels and in reality that policy led to an increase in greenhouse gases rather than a decrease that would obviously be insane
9347071 third party or independent candidates can split votes and cause political upheavals even if they have no hope of gaining office
9347072 dont expect much honesty transparency or accountability from climate armageddonites
9347073 observed climate change and the negligible global effect of greenhouse gas emission limits in the state of colorado
9347074 the system of modern capitalism will generate ever larger environmental consequences outstripping efforts to manage them
9347075 it is unimaginable that american politics as we know it will deliver the transformative changes needed
9347076 it really has nothing to do with his stand on global warming
9347077 hes a great faculty member hes an institution at csu
9347078 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9347079 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
9347080 hes said many times that the primary battle was historic and exciting and that in the end result it would be good for the democratic party that it would energize a lot of people and bring a lot of new people out
9347081 he expected all along that this would resolve itself elegantly and organically and it did
9347082 i think hes very happy with where we are we have a nominee a spectacular nominee and hes going to do everything he can to see him elected
9347083 we think gore can deliver a compelling message on both the economy and foreign policy as relates to energy
9347084 hes a messenger there are a lot of elected officials that voters dont readily accept information from and hes one that they do they think that hes got credibility he has some credibility because a lot of voters believe that if he were elected the last eight years would have been different
9347085 what he has said is that he is not interested in serving in a future administration but that he hasnt ruled out public office and that if he ran for office again it would probably be for president
9347086 he has found a very unique role and platform as a kind of public private citizen able to harness resources creatively to make a huge impact on the climate crisis
9347087 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people
9347088 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
9347089 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
9347090 when he walks out onstage tonight in front of 75 000 to 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
9347091 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
9347092 im leaning obama but im still mad its a childish mad but there it is
9347093 i wasnt going to let my disappointment stand in the way of being at what is an historic event
9347094 seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9347095 the question for the american people is whether they can make this odyssey that democratic delegates to the convention made seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president

9347104 i cant give you an opinion because im not pedrosas teammate so i dont know what problem he has
9347105 as for me im happy with michelin because its trying to work to produce the best tyre and you could see that in this race
9347106 i didnt have the option there was no choice for me to make on my side i wont be switching
9347107 he obviously does miracles to race in that condition is very tough
9347108 he has stabs of pain you saw his face during this mornings warm up those stabs are very painful he only needed to suffer a stab at the wrong moment if you have it in the garage you just clinch your teeth but if you have it on the track you may fall
9347109 its a shame but nothing changes its still him hats off to a rider who has done what he has in those conditions this weekend
9347110 unfortunately casey did not have the right feeling with the front tyre
9347111 the thing which was important was the fact that when a rider especially in motogp is demotivated first of all it is difficult to work with him
9347112 the question of feeling is an interesting question but also its a safety issue he has to feel that he really wants to race
9347113 the only thing we were looking at in this issue was to make sure that we would come to a solution in order to help honda because honda had wanted some help on this issue because they didnt know how to solve it
9347114 honda came to us because they had a problem with a rider we had already been feeling this problem with the rider for a long time even though he was leading the championship
9347115 at a certain point in time you need to say okay we need to concentrate on the future now we can concentrate on things which we think are more important but the important thing for us was the management of the situation with honda because they were in a tough situation with their rider
9347116 we met with honda for probably 10 to 12 hours during the weekend and we agreed
9347117 it was something which we had to sort out between honda and us and then honda and its sponsor repsol which is very close to dani it is never the best solution but its the solution that had to be acceptable
9347118 we informed dorna about the situation because we thought it was absolutely normal to do so but there was no pressure from dorna at least on our side nobody else forced us to do what we just did
9347119 it is very disappointing for the weekend to end like this after showing such a high level of performance in practice
9347120 basically we took the decision to put one lap on the race tyre in warm up this morning to get it scrubbed in weve done it before and not had a problem but today i could feel from the first lap that the grip wasnt right
9347121 after a few laps it started to feel better and i was gaining confidence but it let go
9347122 its a real shame but anyway we tried hard here and once again i think weve shown we are very fast we have a great bike and tyres that work fantastically
9347123 this gives me confidence for next year and im looking forward to it already
9347124 having aggravated the injury to my rib we missed two sessions and basically ran out of time to set the bike up
9347125 we got a good start to the race but i was suffering with quite a lot of discomfort from the injury and i just couldnt push as hard as i wanted to were struggling with a few problems with the front end feeling but again thats simply down to a lack of track time
9347126 all of the other bridgestone riders are on a different specification tyre and this is something we need time to test as i think it will make a big difference for us
9347127 im having some intense treatment overnight and hopefully we can get plenty of laps under our belt tomorrow to put us in better stead for my home race in indianapolis
9347128 after suffering with so many challenges lately he is quite down
9347129 its always tough coming back from an injury but he knows that he needs to put that behind him get his head down and get on with securing the results we know hes capable of
9347130 what if mccain goes down is she ready to lead
9347131 her fifth child was born with downs syndrome anyone who has a child with or without any sort of special needs knows that being a committed mother is not easy
9347132 older mothers account for only about 9 of all live births each year and 25 of down syndrome births
9347133 we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives
9347134 thanks be to god that gov palin is pro life and the baby wasnt one of the 80 of down syndrome lives that are aborted each year
9347135 say a prayer for gov palin and her family and thank god that the baby is blessed with a pro life family
9347136 im sorry but my maternal instincts oh party of touted family values are having a little trouble balancing this devoted wife and mother of five spiel with an infant born in april with down syndrome and flitting about the country chasing a vice presidency

9347152 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
9347153 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
9347154 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

9347170 ms palin has made it clear through her actions that she is unwilling to do even as much as the bush administration to address the impacts of global warming
9347171 unfortunately with her support for drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coasts governor palin will simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil
9347172 in fact there is insufficient evidence that polar bears are in danger of becoming extinct within the foreseeable future the possible listing of a healthy species like the polar bear would be based on uncertain modeling of possible effects the center for biological diversity which petitioned for the polar bear to be protected wants the listing to force the government to either stop or severely limit any public or private action that produces or even allows the production of greenhouse gases such limits should be adopted through an open process in which environmental issues are weighed against economic and social needs and where scientists debate and present information that policy makers need to make the best decisions americans should become involved in the issue of climate change by offering suggestions for constructive action to their state governments but listing the polar bear as threatened is the wrong way to get to the right answer
9347173 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
9347174 completely ridiculous and a waste of the courts time this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear

9347180 as we continue to find genes that interact with each other and with environmental influences in this complex chronic disease we are building the foundation for personalized treatments tailored to a patients genetic profile
9347181 we will resequence the gene regions we have identified to pinpoint the causative mutations in these genes
9347182 we strongly suspect one gene will provide a compelling target for drug development given whats known about its biology
9347183 although the gene variants we found may have a stronger signal in pediatric ibd than in adult onset ibd we do not believe them to be limited to varieties of the disease that begin in childhood
9347184 as we better understand the complex gene interactions in ibd we may be able to diagnose patients by their genetic profile to predict who will better respond to anti tnf drugs
9347185 if better knowledge of the disease pathway enables pharmaceutical companies to develop anti tnf drugs in pill form the medications will be easier to deliver as well as more customized to each patient

9347346 the information avalanche coming from all sides the internet pdas hundreds of television channels is burying us in extraneous data that prevent important facts and knowledge from reaching a broad audience

9347350 when students are allowed to use trays they tend to roam around the cafeteria grabbing food with abandon until space on the tray runs out if you revoke their trays making it impossible for students to carry a surplus of dishes they will make their selections more carefully and be satisfied with less food overall

9347365 so where does this leave midnight sun my first feeling was that there was no way to continue writing isnt like math in math two plus two always equals four no matter what your mood is like with writing the way you feel changes everything if i tried to write midnight sun now in my current frame of mind james would probably win and all the cullens would die which wouldnt dovetail too well with the original story in any case i feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on midnight sun and so it is on hold indefinitely

9347371 boating is not a matter of life and death it is more important than that
9347372 what i really enjoy a lot about the plover is that it is the real thing it was actually here in 1944 and it was running it is not a replica or anything it is really a part of the community and i really enjoy watching the kids when they steer the boat there is lots of enjoyment on the plover
9347373 and why i like it here there is so much protected water and theres so many places to go and see in a boat even in the winter we go places ive got pictures of us in this boat the incredible in january and february out on sucia and stuart island
9347374 i know who has the right of way my rule of the road gets down to everybody else has the right of way because its just not worth standing ground give way if you have to its just not worth even getting boats close to each other too many things can go wrong
9347375 another thing is i never cut buoys drive between the buoy and the shore the buoys are there because they are aids to navigation i am kind of a deep water person i probably learned that growing up on the ocean
9347376 take a class and go by the rules dont take shortcuts boating has been around so long there is plenty of information its an old art running a boat the tradition is good when it comes to that go by the rules that makes it better for everybody

9347500 no you explore and develop and out of it comes the drama it cant be there at the beginning because you have to have the characters there before you have the drama
9347501 i gathered together talented actors and collaborated with them to create characters and bring the whole world of the film into existence through a very long creative process that lasted months and you know my job is to guide all of that so that i can draw from it and build as we go along
9347502 the simple principle is this they only know what their characters would know they are liberated to see the film from their characters point of view they arent inhibited or distracted by an overview of the film apart from anything else what you have to remember is my way of making films is that their journey of exploration is my journey too so its not as if i start with an absolutely clear fixed set of ideas about exactly what the film is going to be and then just carry it out i really embark on a journey with everybody to discover the movie its about creating a space for the actor to be completely creative and to collaborate with me on creating the characters and because each actor only sees the world of the film from his or her characters point of view then it means that it can be totally truthful

9347876 jesus stood at a fork in the road would he fulfill his purpose and bring glory to god or would he shrink back and live a comfortable self centered life you face the same choice will you live for your own goals comfort and pleasure or will you live the reast of your life for gods glory knowing that he has promised eternal rewards
9347877 its time to settle this issue who are you going to live for yourself or god you may hesitate wondering whether you will have strength to live for god
9347878 right now god is inviting you to live for his glory by fulfilling the purposes he made for you its really the only way to live everything else is just existing real life begins by committing yourself completely to jesus christ if you are not sure you have done this all you need to do is receive and believe

9347935 this confirms what weve been seeing for a couple of decades in observational studies
9347936 there is a benefit of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for heart failure patients
9347937 there are few treatments we have in medicine that affect total mortality in patients
9347938 just a handful of treatments affect total mortality even a small move percentage wise is a very important effect
9347939 these data suggest that telmisartan confers a modest benefit when added to other proven therapies
9347940 in view of the drugs tolerability and effect on cardiovascular endpoints telmisartan could be regarded as a potential treatment for patients with vascular disease or high risk diabetes if they are unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor
9347941 arbs that have been studied in coronary disease are safe but possibly less effective alternatives in patients with intolerance to ace inhibitors although data are too limited to reach definitive conclusions the clinical effect of arbs seems less robust than that of ace inhibitors

9347948 i expect from the eu summit that europe wont give up faced with this dirty attempt at aggression
9347949 i will base the foreign policies of the russian federation on the following five principles
9347950 fourth the absolute priority for us is the defence of the life and dignity of our citizens no matter where they are located
9347951 and finally the fifth russia has regions where it has privileged interests as do other countries in the world there are countries in these regions with which we are traditionally connected by friendly good neighbourly relations historically special relations we will very attentively work in these regions and develop friendly relations with these states with our close neighbours
9347952 as to the future that doesnt only depend on us it also depends on our friends on our partners in the international community they have a choice
9347953 it is not realistic to expect that theres a quick fix or a shortcut we wont solve the conflict issues on the table in two or three weeks
9347954 we have to complete the annapolis process this year this year
9347955 the time factor is important but we either have an agreement on all issues or no agreement
9347956 legal legitimacy to negotiate and certainly not to reach any agreement
9347957 were former insurgents and thats why we call this a reconciliation issue
9347958 its important that theyre now included in the new iraq
9347959 has their reasons for moving more slowly than the coalition would like to see
9347960 the question becomes how much confidence do we have that the iraqi government is going to do right by a bunch of guys it hates
9347961 there are some who will not forget nor forgive that some sons of iraq were insurgents
9347962 it will take positive leadership from the prime minister his government the army and police to implement a transition that achieves reconciliation
9347963 we appreciate and respect them because they have a sense of responsibility toward their communities
9347964 theres very little doubt that we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action

9347968 this is still a big ugly storm still strong and i encourage everyone to leave
9347969 i cant take a chance because so many people died in katrina

9348199 he comprobado por cuenta propia que hay ciertas irregularidades en los textos escolares por ahora esperamos recibir los descargos de los involucrados y determinar qui n es el responsable ya que todo el mundo se est echando la culpa
9348200 creo que la responsabilidad directa es del viceministro de gesti n pedag gica idel vexler porque su despacho es el encargado de la revisi n de estos textos escolares podr haber sido una editorial la que los imprimi pero es su deber revisarlos cuando ya est n listos para su publicaci n
9348201 no es solo el tema de la apolog a al terrorismo sino que tambi n hay otras distorsiones inaceptables como la de decir que andahuaylas es capital de la regi n apur mac estos son textos para educar a los alumnos del per al futuro del pa s y est n llenos de errores garrafales

9348210 hace casi dos meses entregamos lo que fue el primer sencillo esos ojos que afortunadamente fue muy bien recibido por el p blico pues se apoder de lugares privilegiados en los charts debido a eso ya dimos a conocer el segundo track a promocionar que es tras de ti el cual me encanta porque es mi manera de decir que voy tras mis sue os tras las ni as y tras la rep blica mexicana

9348224 la financiaci n privada la tenemos que promover porque es el nico camino que nos va a llevar a una financiaci n suficiente
9348225 nuestra universidad seguir siendo la m s barata de europa
9348226 con una normativa muy transparente para incentivar la colaboraci n p blica privada algo que nada tiene que ver con la privatizaci n de la universidad
9348227 hay que comprender que cada una tiene sus propias dificultades y situaci n y habr que ver cu l es el acompa amiento
9348228 la universidad espa ola seguir siendo de las m s baratas de europa
9348229 ser a un error investigar s lo lo que requiera el mercado
9348230 lo importante es que dentro de la ecuaci n total la financiaci n privada sume si es la parte de investigaci n aplicada pues estupendo la financiaci n p blica se destinar entonces a la investigaci n m s b sica y a disciplinas que no tengan una aplicaci n tan inmediata
9348231 la parte p blica ha hecho un esfuerzo de financiaci n y ahora hay que estimular la parte privada
9348232 precisamente ahora es un momento para reflexionar sobre el modelo de colaboraci n con la universidad
9348233 en los campus de excelencia internacional la empresa privada estar en la ecuaci n creo que este a o conseguiremos concretar alguno
9348234 pero creo que ser a un error poner una financiaci n en el sistema si no hay reflexi n previa y una hoja de ruta para alcanzar la excelencia as con unos objetivos claros podremos atraer a la financiaci n privada si no ser imposible

9348320 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9348321 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
9348322 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
9348323 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board

9348387 irish rail have presented no list of what car parks will be upgraded or in what order and what it will comprise its all aspirational
9348388 while i have no problem charging people who park at railway stations infrequently it is extremely unfair on those who have already bought weekly monthly or annual travel tickets for their commute so they should be exempt from the charge
9348389 many commuters either walk or cycle to their local station but this is not always possible and many have no alternative but to park and ride as there are very few bus links to railway stations
9348390 there has been no public consultation on this new system which will hit commuters who are already finding their take home pay reduced because of the spiralling cost of living

9348464 a woman lifted up a child and said o messenger of allaah will his hajj be counted
9348465 al qaraafi said in al yawaaqeet children will earn reward for good deeds that they do because of the hadeeth of the khathami woman who lifted up her child and asked the prophet peace and blessings of allaah be upon him about his hajj
9348466 the bad deeds of young children are not recorded but their good deeds will be recorded according to the sound opinion
9348467 abul aaliyah al riyaahi said umar ibn al khattaab said the young childs good deeds will be recorded but his bad deeds will not be recorded
9348468 the scholars do not differ concerning the fact that children will be rewarded for whatever acts of obedience to allaah they do and will be let off for any bad deeds that they do and any bad deeds they do deliberately will be counted as mistakes
9348469 it was one of the customs of the muslims to take their children for hajj and expose them to the mercy of allaah
9348470 it is nothing strange that a child should earn reward and status in the hereafter for his salaah zakaah hajj and other good deeds if he does them as they should be done because this is grace and mercy from allaah just as allaah shows mercy to the dead by rewarding them for acts of charity done on their behalf by the living do you not see that they the scholars are agreed that a child should be commanded to pray when he reaches the age of understanding and that the prophet peace and blessings of allaah be upon him led anas and the orphan in prayer most of the salaf said that zakaah has to be paid on the property of orphans and it is impossible that they would not be rewarded for that their guardians and the one who does this on their behalf will also certainly be rewarded as will the one who takes them for hajj as a blessing and mercy from allaah it was reported that umar said childrens good deeds will be recorded and their bad deeds will not be recorded i do not know of anyone whose opinion is worth following who said anything to the contrary
9348471 children will be rewarded for their acts of obedience to allaah and their good deeds will be recorded but not their bad deeds
9348472 the correct opinion in my view is that they are both encouraged to do that and will both be rewarded for it i e the child and his or her guardian the prophet peace and blessings of allaah be upon him said to the woman who asked about the childs hajj and you will be rewarded and allaah knows best
9348473 according to the four imaams children will be rewarded for their acts of obedience and their good deeds will be recorded whether they are mature or not this was reported from umar may allaah be pleased with him some scholars report that there was consensus ijmaa in this matter it is also indicated by what we have already said under the heading of virtues fadaail that the prophet peace and blessings of allaah be upon him said the jihaad of the very old and the very young is hajj and umrah as well as the hadeeth about the woman who lifted up a child

9348482 prior to and leads politics and therefore it is more important than politics in tracking the nature of the social order and its changes
9348483 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
9348484 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either a society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities the letter of the law is too cold and formal to have a beneficial influence on society whenever the tissue of life is woven of legalistic relations there is an atmosphere of moral mediocrity paralyzing mans noblest impulses
9348485 at the root at the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries which could be defined as rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy
9348486 i refer to the prevailing western view of the world which was first born during the renaissance and found its political expression from the period of the enlightenment
9348487 one of the very best writers of english in the country
9348488 to see christ as god and man is probably no more difficult today than it has been for you it may be a matter of not being able to accept what you call a suspension of the law of the flesh and the physical but for my part i think that when i know what the laws of the flesh and physical reality really are then i will know what god is we know them as we see them not as god sees them for me it is the virgin birth the incarnation the resurrection which are the true laws of the flesh and the physical death decay destruction are the suspension of these laws i am always astonished at the emphasis the church places on the body it is not the soul she says that will rise but the body glorified i have always thought that purity was the most mysterious of the virtues but it occurs to me that it would never have entered human consciousness if we were not to look forward to a resurrection of the body which will be flesh and spirit united in peace in the way they were in christ the resurrection of christ seems the high point in the law of nature
9348489 the truth is that only in the mystery of the incarnate word does the mystery of man take on light
9348490 gratitude for the gift is shown only by allowing it to make one fruitful
9348491 a fter receiving the first news of the publication of the encyclical the rev charles e curran instructor of moral theology of the catholic university of america flew back to washington from the west where he had been staying late on the afternoon of july 29 he and nine other professors of theology of the catholic university met by evident prearrangement in caldwell hall to receive again by prearrangement with the washington post the encyclical part by part as it came from the press the story further indicated that by nine oclock that night they had received the whole encyclical had read it had analyzed it criticized it and had composed their six hundred word statement of dissent then they began that long series of telephone calls to theologians throughout the east which went on according to the post until 3 30 a m seeking authorization to attach their names as endorsers signers was the term used of the statement although those to whom they had telephoned could not have had an opportunity to see either the encyclical or their statement meanwhile they had arranged through one of the local television stations to have the statement broadcast that night
9348492 the first thing that we have to note about the whole performance is this so far as i have been able to discern never in the recorded history of the church has a solemn proclamation of a pope been received by any group of catholic people with so much disrespect and contempt
9348493 nothing is more opposed to witness than vulgarization nothing is more unlike the apostolate than propaganda
9348494 it should be possible to discover the hidden mechanics by which all traditional elements of our political and spiritual world were dissolved into a conglomeration of where everything seems to have lost specific value and has become unrecognizable for human comprehension unusable for human purpose to yield to the mere process of disintegration has become an irresistible temptation not only because it has assumed the spurious grandeur of historical necessity but also because everything outside it has begun to appear lifeless bloodless meaningless and unreal
9348495 from here i see nothing but fire burning everywhere everything has been set ablaze the church and rectory are untouched thus far
9348496 was startled to read in the baltimore sun that seventy two priests of the baltimore area had signed the statement of dissent
9348497 let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us looking to jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame
9348498 you desire proof that christ is speaking in me he is not weak in dealing with you but is powerful in you for he was crucified in weakness but lives by the power of god for we are weak in him but in dealing with you we shall live with him by the power of god examine yourselves to see whether you are holding to your faith test yourselves
9348499 lord remember the secret worth of all our human worthlessness
9348500 this book is one of the most lyrical and moving reflections on god i have encountered it is also remarkably generous both to believers and nonbelievers most helpfully it is about how to pray and how to suffer through the dark night in which answers and communication seem absent a remarkable book by a remarkable man
9348501 neither joy nor love nor light and on a darkling plain
9348502 the lord the lord god merciful and gracious long suffering and full of goodness and truth
9348503 then his wife said to him are you still holding to your innocence curse god and die but he said to her are even you going to speak as senseless women do we accept good things from god and should we not accept evil through all this job said nothing sinful
9348504 the place where he was awaiting me a place where none appeared
9348505 jesus has a very special love for you but as for me the silence and the emptiness is so great that i look and do not see listen and do not hear
9348506 i accept not in my feelings but with my will the will of god i accept his will
9348507 some thing is to be achieved through the process and now one realises that becoming aims at nothing and achieves nothing

9348528 basically we took the decision to put one lap on the race tire in warm up this morning to get it scrubbed in weve done it before and not had a problem but today i could feel from the first lap that the grip wasnt right
9348529 after a few laps it started to feel better and i was gaining confidence but it let go its a real shame but anyway we tried hard here and once again i think weve shown we are very fast we have a great bike and tires that work fantastically this gives me confidence for next year and im looking forward to it already
9348530 i always had much better feeling with the bike and the results prove it i hope to continue this way for the rest of the season i would love to fight for the podium at each gran prix i know its not easy but i will try

9348565 these banks have embarked on massive campaigns to entice clients to borrow more and more loans and thereby maximise their interests
9348566 we recognise we have a social obligation to try and ensure our customers do not borrow so excessively that they find themselves in financial difficulty it is not easy to advise customers as fully as we would wish on their aggregate debt levels from all banks as we do not have a fully operational credit bureau requiring compulsory submissions from all banks
9348567 we are cognizant of the soaring inflation levels and the pressures it is putting on the residents of the uae we believe it is our responsibility to ensure our borrowing customers are not over leveraged and are able to repay the loans they take from us
9348568 a credit evaluation process is carried out prior to extending loans that involves reviewing the loan applicants bank statements to determine other obligations in order to encourage a transparent customer engagement we are shortly introducing a free 7 day lockup period for our loans if any customer is not satisfied with our loan he can return the loan to the bank there will be no penalty on the customer and all fees and charges will be refunded
9348569 more regulation is required in respect of the form and content of credit agreements this may include a requirement for the bank to notify the customer of the terms of the credit arrangement prior to entering into the agreement regulations may also specify in detail as to what the pre notification and credit agreement should disclose such as interest charges method of interest calculation related fees insurance charges etc
9348570 in addition a mandatory right to make pre payment and consequent rebate of credit charges may also be included further any change in the terms and conditions of the credit agreement should require prior notification to customers

9348573 turkey has an important role in the region it is a balanced and moderate role
9348574 alf yad sees tremendous potential in the renewable energy sector and embio is a partner that we are sure will successfully deliver the first of its kind production facility in the gcc in addition to commercial considerations embio represents the best and highest purpose for which alf yad was formed to assist the development of serious commercial ventures based here in the region ventures that will be capable of competing on a global scale founded by two young arab entrepreneurs who left their highly successful and well established professional careers to develop proprietary sustainability projects in the region we believe embio represents a real achievement in local sustainable development
9348575 we are confident in both the nature and timing of embio the need for a functional non fossil fuel alternative has now become more evident than ever generally speaking biodiesel is highly complimentary to a holistic sustainable energy strategy as it concentrates on displacing liquid petroleum fuels while other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind focus predominantly on power generation
9348576 here in the gcc as in the rest of the world we are faced with surging energy demand and growing pressure on the environment it was clear that the need for sustainable development is critical to a prosperous future for the uae and the region the majority of the infrastructure underlying the regions economic growth is diesel powered given the difficulty of making immediate major cuts to fuel subsidies the gcc states are rapidly exploring ways to make greater use of alternative energy to meet the growing domestic demand embio therefore presents a truly viable solution
9348577 we are very proud to partner with embio in this exceptional venture this is clearly one of the fastest growing alternative energy sectors and the united arab emirates is very well positioned to take advantage of this trend due to a number of local factors including strong economic growth large carbon footprint per capita increasing federal support and the recent introduction of several ambitious sustainability plans apart from its obvious potential as a high return investment we are convinced that this project has the added benefit of enormous social value for every citizen in the gcc which cannot be purely quantified in economic terms
9348578 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
9348579 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
9348580 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
9348581 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
9348582 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
9348583 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
9348584 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
9348585 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
9348586 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
9348587 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
9348588 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
9348589 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
9348590 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
9348591 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
9348592 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
9348593 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
9348594 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
9348595 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
9348596 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
9348597 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
9348598 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
9348599 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
9348600 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
9348601 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
9348602 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
9348603 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
9348604 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
9348605 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
9348606 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
9348607 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
9348608 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
9348609 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

9348628 in 2003 my office tried to see if we could reconfigure our system to do such a task and after 12 months we stopped without a feasible solution and with the knowledge that recovery for such a sweeping adjustment to minimum wage would take at least six months before all employees would see the right amounts in their hard earned paychecks
9348629 aside from the expense of costly and lengthy litigation over my authority to pay state workers their full wages the governors move would harm thousands of families who already are struggling with mortgages and higher gas food and energy costs the loss of their spending dollars will increase the loss in consumer confidence and further deteriorate californias fragile economy

9348780 la negaci n de la mujer y la desigualdad en la educaci n
9348781 fue y es el m s racional para el funcionamiento del conjunto del estado
9348782 ser m s justo porque da oportunidades a todas las ccaa

9348784 aunque la arquitectura esencial de la constituci n ha sido un xito 30 a os despu s ser a conveniente reformarla

9348791 seamos mucho m s pa s m s fuertes y podemos afrontar con m s tranquilidad un ciclo econ mico adverso como el que vivimos
9348792 me imagino una desestructuraci n progresiva de eta ser un final paso a paso

9348794 eta ir cada vez a menos y con una p rdida de comprensi n social en eses segmento abertzale que siempre es la clave
9348795 mi opini n es que aznar tuvo aquella postura por estar al lado de bush creyendo que eso le hac a grande
9348796 yo hab a prometido que retirar a las tropas de irak no era una decisi n f cil pero se pudo hacer
9348797 admiro a la monta a y a los monta eros por ser un deporte que cuida y preserva la naturaleza donde se valora el esfuerzo y est presente la solidaridad
9348798 zapatero est en catalu a como el bombero pir mano
9348799 quiero un pp que pueda ser votado por gente que no defiende el grueso de nuestra ideolog a
9348800 zapatero en catalu a est en la situaci n del bombero pir mano
9348801 el nuevo modelo de financiaci n auton mica debe hacerse por unanimidad porque es la garant a de igualdad entre los ciudadanos
9348802 este gobierno lleva cuatro meses y da la sensaci n de que est agotado
9348803 lo m s importante que ten a el gobierno que es abordar la crisis econ mica ha sido un fracaso lleva cuatro meses y la sensaci n que transmite es que es un gobierno antiguo y agotado son los mismos diciendo lo mismo es un gobierno quemado
9348804 el impuesto de sociedades se puede bajar al 20 subir amos al 25 la deducci n por intereses de cr ditos hipotecarios y el presupuestos no deber a crecer m s del 2
9348805 queremos que estas medidas se debatan en septiembre le vamos a decir al presidente que no nos parece bien que el gasto p blico crezca otra vez por encima del crecimiento nominal de la econom a
9348806 no aceptar a ning n di logo eta s lo tiene una esperanza de ganar y de conseguir sus objetivos que alguien lo negocie porque asesinando no los va a lograr
9348807 el mensaje que hay que darle a eta que era el principio del pacto antiterrorista es que gobierne quien gobierne en espa a no se va a negociar de pol tica nunca
9348808 mi obligaci n como l der de la oposici n es llevarme bien con la iglesia cat lica soy cat lico pero me tengo que llevar bien con todo el mundo que es lo que pido al gobierno no le pido que se haga cat lico sino que no cree m s problemas de los necesarios
9348809 cre el problema y ahora ni cumple la ley que l mismo aprob ni es capaz de dar una soluci n al problema
9348810 no quiera ir al congreso a explicar lo que ha hecho y lo que va a hacer
9348811 quien act a como aprendiz de brujo se puede encontrar con lo que se ha encontrado
9348812 no pueden servir para que el gobierno haga enjuagues pacte una cosa a cambio de otra e intente contentar a unos y a otros
9348813 abordar la crisis econ mica que est atravesando espa a
9348814 los espa oles y las empresas se aprietan el cintur n
9348815 la mayor a de los ministerios no han asumido el estatut
9348816 en absoluto en primer lugar porque la intervenci n ten a que favorecer la distensi n y al contrario fue prepotente en los contenidos no se movi y lo que dijo no cumple con los preceptos del estatut para catalu a ha sido una intervenci n frustrante
9348817 despu s de todo lo que ha pasado no hiciese una intervenci n m s distendida y avanzando algunos conceptos no s si tiene otros compromisos si est haciendo t ctica o simplemente si tiene la intenci n de no cumplir el estatut
9348818 una hoja de ruta de qu supone desplegar el estatut y un calendario a d a de hoy la mayor a de ministerios no han asumido el nuevo estatut el estado contin a haciendo leyes que lo vulneran
9348819 ha llegado la hora de que decidamos si nos conviene seguir si ndolo
9348820 el problema de catalu a no es ni extremadura ni andaluc a
9348821 me hubiera gustado una llamada de montilla cuando nos llamaron malnacidos
9348822 he echado de menos llamadas de compa eros del psc
9348823 ser a bueno que nos reuni ramos todos los presidentes socialitas para no defender cosas distintas
9348824 un partido de centro reformista para ir reformando lo que hab a que reformar sin prisas evitando nuevas confrontaciones
9348825 ese partido es el que galicia y espa a necesitan
9348826 es una traici n a espa a y a la constituci n espa ola
9348827 todos los compa eros que se han quedado en la prisi n de martutene y en otras c rceles
9348828 no hay ninguna posibilidad de negociar con la izquierda abertzale de retomar el di logo todas las puertas se han cerrado y la nica posibilidad de la izquierda abertzale es convencer a la banda terrorista eta para que abandone las armas
9348829 golpes policiales a pesar de que nos hab a acusado de que hab amos bajado la guardia
9348830 una estrategia pol tica que respete totalmente los derechos humanos situ ndonos en par metros puramente pol ticos y dejando de lado la lucha armada que adem s del sufrimiento que causa cada d a que pasa es m s rechazada por la ciudadan a vasca
9348831 si el arroyo no hubiera estado all no se habr an perdido tantas vidas
9348832 hay que tener en cuenta que los aviones pueden irse hacia los lados
9348833 siento un desprecio cada d a mayor por este r gimen
9348834 pone mucho nfasis en el crecimiento y la fortaleza de la econom a espa ola pero no reconoce su grave error de haber minusvalorado esa crisis hasta hace poco
9348835 zapatero tampoco formula autocr tica sobre el creciente desaf o nacionalista y las tensiones territoriales que se han agudizado en los ltimos a os
9348836 elude tambi n cualquier amago de autocr tica cuando responde sobre la negociaci n con eta
9348837 su conformismo es peligroso porque los nacionalismos suponen una amenaza real para la espa a que dise a la constituci n
9348838 zapatero muestra un desmedido optimismo cuando considera que vivimos una etapa de asentamiento de nuestro sistema democr tico lo cual parece un sarcasmo en unos momentos en los que las diferencias pol ticas y los intereses territoriales han creado graves incertidumbres sobre el futuro de espa a
9348839 la crisis su intensidad no s lo ha tomado por sorpresa al gobierno espa ol ning n pa s estaba preparado para algo as lo singular del nuestro es que las primeras medidas adoptadas para hacer frente fueron aqu en parte por razones electoralistas poco adecuadas para atacar la principal causa del deterioro la p rdida de competitividad derivada de un modelo de crecimiento sustentado en la construcci n y otras actividades con poco valor a adido
9348840 abordar ahora lo que no se hizo antes inversi n prioritaria en formaci n y tecnolog a reforma del mercado laboral y liberalizaci n de los servicios
9348841 la crisis condiciona la soluci n de los problemas pol ticos pero tambi n que los problemas pol ticos enquistados dificultan la superaci n de la crisis
9348842 el president montilla ha contestado que no va a aceptar ni un mal acuerdo ni imposiciones de nadie
9348843 lamentablemente la econom a espa ola contin a acumulando datos muy preocupantes y ya no tanto por la incidencia directa que tienen en el presente sino sobre todo por el panorama plagado de incertidumbres que sigue abri ndose camino a medio plazo a n se desconoce cu l es el fondo real de la crisis y datos como los ofrecidos en estos d as por eurostat vuelven a situarnos ante la perspectiva de un inquietante futuro
9348844 espa a sigue siendo el pa s de la ue donde con mayor velocidad los ciudadanos sufren las graves consecuencias de la desaceleraci n es otra constataci n en definitiva de la irrelevancia de los planes de choque puestos en marcha por el gobierno meses atr s y por ende de su falta de previsi n e indolencia ante la crisis
9348845 es cierto que la crisis que padecemos es de car cter mundial pero aqu y ahora se ha reforzado por acci n y omisi n
9348846 la marca y la imagen han funcionado han servido al presidente del gobierno para renovar el triunfo en las elecciones y para generar en el pp una impotente animadversi n que le ha hecho perderlas
9348847 el boom inmobiliario iniciado en los a os 80 y llevado a su apoteosis en el ltimo lustro ha sido claramente positivo para el desarrollo del pa s ha empujado con fuerza la inversi n extranjera y el turismo ha creado millones de puestos de trabajo y ha aumentado la riqueza patrimonial de los espa oles pero tambi n ha tenido efectos indeseables sobre la conservaci n del litoral en no pocas ocasiones los abusos han estrangulado para varias generaciones la posibilidad de un desarrollo sostenible y han rebajado la calidad tur stica la ambici n desmedida y la miop a de las administraciones cuando no su complicidad han mutilado gravemente muchos kil metros de playa es imprescindible reparar el da o desde luego pero sin cometer nuevas tropel as y arbitrariedades contra el ciudadano
9348848 el nuevo escenario pol tico deja descolocado a otegi cuya invocaci n al di logo fue inmediatamente respondida ayer por jos blanco que subray que esa etapa ya se ha cerrado y que lo nico que puede hacer el ex dirigente es intentar persuadir a eta de que abandone las armas lo m s probable es que otegi tenga que volver a la c rcel en los pr ximos meses pero ser a probablemente un error dar por terminada su carrera pol tica ya que sigue siendo el l der de mayor peso en la izquierda abertzale tal vez alg n d a si las circunstancias cambian y eta da su brazo a torcer otegi podr a dejar de ser un mu eco roto y resurgir cual ave f nix
9348849 el encarcelamiento de otegi y su posterior excarcelaci n representan el fracaso de toda una pol tica de apaciguamiento enga o y negociaci n con eta es dif cil para una sociedad democr tica aceptar que este sujeto fuera ensalzado por el propio presidente del gobierno
9348850 fue para el psoe y para rodr guez zapatero el caballero blanco de la negociaci n con los terroristas no es extra o que arnaldo otegi abandonara la prisi n reivindicando el di logo y la negociaci n que ayer mismo rechaz tajantemente el vicesecretario general del psoe jos blanco
9348851 arnaldo otegi es una especie de etarra en comisi n de servicio al que los tribunales rechazaron su complemento de destino envi ndolo a una penitenciar a
9348852 sin caer en alarmismo ni en psicosis habituales tras una cat strofe conviene tener en cuenta las advertencias de los expertos para que barajas sea un aeropuerto todav a m s seguro fiable y tan bien valorado por los pasajeros
9348853 ich habe extra beim weltreiter verband angerufen dort sagte man mir dass die betroffenen bereits am mittwochmorgen benachrichtigt wurden wir haben keine post erhalten

9348856 there was a nice big kiss at the end with both hands on the cheeks they looked great

9348863 es ist unter inhaltlichen und wirtschaftlichen gesichtspunkten zu gew hrleisten dass diese form der aufgabenerledigung den anforderungen des justizvollzuges entspricht
9348864 die senatsverwaltung f r justiz bedarf neben dem rechtlichen und fachspezifischen sachverstand der durch die mitarbeiter der senatsverwaltungen f r justiz finanzen und stadtentwicklungsverwaltung bereitgehalten wird beratungen durch private dienstleister
9348865 grundlage der berechnungen der honorarleistungen bilden dabei ein derzeit markt blicher durchschnittstagessatz von 2500 euro bis 3000 euro netto
9348866 die umgehende ausschreibung der beratungsdienstleitungen ist dringend erforderlich um bei der inbetriebnahme der justizvollzugsanstalt heidering die genannten wesentlichen betriebsleistungen vollst ndig und rechtzeitig erbringen zu k nnen

9348902 the genetic diversity in europe is very low there isnt really much
9348903 that makes perfect sense with the major migration waves that went into europe
9348904 a pattern in which genes mirror geography is essentially what you would expect from a history in which people moved slowly and mated mainly with their close neighbours

9348920 o que quer que aconte a ou o que seja dito a verdade est no nosso lado
9348921 estou profundamente preocupado com a situa o na ge rgia
9348922 acho que o momento de o primeiro ministro olhar para si mesmo e decidir se ainda est apto para ocupar o cargo se empenhar se em seguir os problemas do pa s piorar o
9348923 a agressividade minha natureza mas n o um comportamento indecente
9348924 n o fiz nada de errado e portanto tenho direito de continuar meu trabalho como primeiro ministro meu comportamento n o causou dano ao pa s
9348925 j que o governo n o pode resolver a crise o parlamento a melhor solu o para encontrar a solu o
9348926 por isso preciso assumir que grande quantidade caiu em m os alem s
9348927 por enquanto os pombos est o sendo lan ados em p ra quedas no territ rio ocupado

9348954 fue una jugada en la cual ram n morales me dio el bal n ya iba yo con toda la decisi n para tirar tuvimos muchas llegadas pero no pudimos concretar las jugadas que se provocaron hasta el final que logramos meterla
9348955 uno trabaja para estar siempre dispuesto hay que seguir trabajando siempre con ortega practicamos los tiros a gol sabemos que los resultados van a llegar
9348956 eso nos afect la desventaja num rica y fue un partido muy sucio lo hicieron muy sucio injustamente con la tarjeta parando mucho las jugadas de nosotros pero nos dej una gran ense anza hay ocasiones en que influye el arbitraje y si se dan cuenta creo que no fue la justicia pareja para los dos lados pero hay que aprender hay que ser tambi n ma osos
9348957 fue muy injusto se ve a el dolo del rbitro en la expulsi n de juan pablo rodr guez cuando ellos rayados tambi n en los primeros quince minutos ya ten an amonestados a dos jugadores
9348958 no no no uno esperar a que de local fuera un partido muy abierto pero parece que rayados le tienen miedo al equipo hay que tambi n entenderlo de esa manera
9348959 hay que ser astutos ma osos para jugar de otra manera pero eso cuenta mucho en la filosof a y a m no me gustar a por respeto a la gente venirme a un estadio y jugar sucio o jugar para atr s
9348960 pareciera que la quer an cobrar muy r pido pero estamos tranquilos estamos en el liderato del grupo y estamos trabajando bien
9348961 nos vamos mal porque hoy los tres puntos eran obligados
9348962 que se acabara el partido antes eso fue lo nico que falt para que gan ramos l es el que tiene la decisi n en la cancha independientemente de eso creo que nosotros debimos de haber mantenido el resultado
9348963 creo que le pega muy bien al bal n jes s padilla sin embargo siento que no deb a haber llegado a tener oportunidad de pegarle al bal n el partido se debi terminar antes lamentablemente no fue as y nos vamos con este empate
9348964 mal nos vamos mal porque hoy los tres puntos eran obligados y los ten amos en la bolsa nos los quitaron en la ltima jugada del partido y eso no nos deja nada contentos
9348965 generalmente es bueno salir con un punto del estadio jalisco sin embargo hoy tuvimos la posibilidad de llevarnos los tres puntos y de manera contundente no lo hicimos
9348966 nosotros hicimos un muy buen partido excelente bien parados ellos pr cticamente en el segundo tiempo la nica jugada que tuvieron fue el remate a gol que anotaron nosotros tuvimos muchas oportunidades que lamentablemente no pudimos concretar
9348967 creo que si hubi ramos perdido hubiera sido injusto porque las oportunidades las tuvimos al final nos desordenamos un poco pero fue parte de querer empatar el partido y nos result
9348968 por lo menos ya no nos metieron varios goles empatamos el partido ven amos de un viaje medio pesado en el cual nos fue bien y eso ser importante para que en el siguiente partido buscar la victoria y seguir sumando
9348969 eso lo tendremos que trabajar pero por el momento de los dos partidos que tuvimos en esta semana no perdimos ninguno y eso era importante para nuestra confianza y que el equipo siga elevando el nivel que queremos encontrar
9348970 ah tambi n a veces es cuesti n de suerte por lo menos las oportunidades las estamos teniendo simplemente hay que tener paciencia para que las oportunidades se vayan concretando
9348971 muy a gusto por todas las condiciones que se presentaron
9348972 s es un muy buen punto la verdad que merecido por el esfuerzo que hicieron los muchachos dentro de la cancha agradecido con el esfuerzo y el orden que manifestaron dentro a pesar de no tener tanto trabajo con algunos y estamos muy tranquilos
9348973 s pero la verdad que eso nunca nos preocupa porque nosotros siempre alineamos incluso hoy alineamos un 91 y eso siempre se da por consecuencia tenemos un plantel muy joven y no nos preocupamos por eso lo que nos preocupamos es por formar a los muchachos hoy fue una gran prueba para ellos les ayuda mucho competir contra jugadores como lo hicieron hoy y la verdad el equipo veracruz tambi n nos exigi y esa es la nica forma de que maduren
9348974 s satisfecho muy a gusto por todas las condiciones que se presentaron en la semana y realmente ven amos con una etiqueta de v ctima y yo se los dije que no iba a ser as y ah est el resultado
9348975 al parecer creo que ya llegaron no s no estoy seguro pero esa era una posibilidad que ellos se regresaran a integrar la banca pero creo que ya regresaron y ya no va a haber necesidad pero lo m s importante es que seguimos ah y que seguimos sacando jugadores
9348976 s una satisfacci n m s que nada porque el trabajo d a con d a est dando resultados y eso nos deja tranquilos a nosotros como t cnicos cuando se trabaja y se cumplen los objetivos pues eso quiere decir que vamos por buen camino
9348977 mucha la verdad que son otros ojos para mi a veces no me alcanza para poder ver todo y l me ayuda much simo creo que hacemos una buena mancuerna y la verdad es un placer tenerlo a mi lado
9348978 se dieron las cosas para dar un buen partido venir a veracruz a jugar al tu por tu contra un gran equipo que es el veracruz la verdad
9348979 pues s la verdad si es un punto muy importante tenemos ocho bajas se quedaron en jamaica desafortunadamente no pudieron salir pero hay chavos que queremos una oportunidad para estar arriba
9348980 pues los conoce tiene conocimiento de todos ahora se presentaron algunos jugadores pero da oportunidad para que nos mostremos todos
9348981 siempre vamos a respetar lo que tengan que opinar a nosotros nos queda dar el esfuerzo y ahora me siento un poco d bil cansado
9348982 por suerte se gan hoy en casa a pesar de que en el principio del juego se nos dificult concretar poco a poco fuimos buscando la manera de hacerle da o al rival y merecidamente obtuvimos el triunfo
9348983 lo m s importante fue que en el primer tiempo supimos mantener la calma sab amos que el rival pretendi de jugar al contragolpe supimos esperarlo para despu s sorprenderlo con lo que se trabaj durante la semana
9348984 obviamente me gustar a anotar en todos los juegos pero aunque ahora no se me present esa oportunidad estoy contento por que poco a poco se est n dando las cosas anteriormente dije que lo importante es que el equipo gane y afortunadamente as esta pasando tanto yo como el grupo en general estamos muy motivamos con este paso esperemos mantenerlo para estar nuevemente en la pelea por el t tulo
9348985 estabamos concientes que nos enfrentar amos a un equipo complicado como pasa con todos los que vienen aqu y esta vez no fue la excepci n necaxa luch todo el tiempo a pesar del calor que fue desgastante para ambos

9349000 i gotta say i dont think this is what happened clearly palins picture was initially taken for her website and use around the state theres no reason for us to think that she was chosen as vp and then she had her photo taken with equipment owned by the state of alaska so basically after her photo was taken it was free to reproduce thus the state of alaska bears no burden on her using that photo as many times as she wants its the same as when obama reproduces images of him swearing in on the bible
9349001 la situaci n no ha cambiado nada siguen las negociaciones yo sigo con la misma idea de marcharme del real madrid quiero jugar en el chelsea se lo he dicho al presidente directivos mijatovic y al entrenador por en sima vez lo digo ante la prensa todav a el entrenador piensa que me puede recuperar pero mi cabeza est en el chelsea

9349005 el club dijo que volvieran en septiembre cuando se cierran las negociaciones
9349006 antes pens que estar a diez a os pero no es posible y ahora tengo ganas de salir
9349007 el problema es que el club no ha conseguido fichar a nadie
9349008 quiero aclarar las cosas porque me llaman pesetero y no saben lo que ha pasado verdaderamente llegu al presidente con una propuesta del chelsea me dijo que si la propuesta era buena me dejar a salir estaba seguro de fichar a otro jugador pero ahora como estamos al final y no han fichado a nadie no quieren dejarme salir

9349141 si para salvarnos el hijo de dios ha tenido que sufrir y morir crucificado no es ciertamente por un cruel designio del padre celeste
9349142 gravedad de la enfermedad de la que nos ten a que curar
9349143 en efecto prosigui es con su muerte y resurrecci n que jes s ha vencido al pecado y a la muerte restableciendo la se or a de dios pero la lucha no ha terminado el mal existe y resiste todas las generaciones hasta nuestros d as qu son los horrores de la guerra la violencia contra los inocentes la miseria y la injusticia con los d biles sino la oposici n del mal al reino de dios y c mo responder a tanta maldad si no es con la fuerza desarmada del amor que vence el odio de la vida que no teme la muerte
9349144 para los cristianos el llevar la cruz no es algo facultativo sino una misi n que debe ser abrazada por amor cristo no cesa de proponer a todos una clara invitaci n quien quiere ser mi disc pulo que renuncie al propio ego smo y lleve conmigo la cruz

9349149 a hist ria uma fantasia e tem uma velocidade enorme se os atores n o passarem credibilidade ao texto a novela n o vai convencer o p blico
9349150 procurei encontrar meios de interpretar uma delegada forte e competente mas que mant m sua feminilidade n o queria fazer estilo jo ozinho com cabelo curtinho
9349151 achei que seria bacana criarmos um clima de passado entre a marta e o fredo por exemplo at para justificar ainda mais a rivalidade dos dois
9349152 o bacana que agora as pessoas n o me enxergam mais como a atriz da globo o p blico sabe que estou na record e assiste mesmo novela

9349166 o hor rio permite uma liberdade maior para abordar temas adultos mas nunca esque o que as novelas muitas vezes s o assistidas por fam lias inteiras

9349221 the good news is that according to the u s department of energy there is ample inventory of crude oil and gasoline the bad news is that gustav a potential category 3 hurricane is forecast to strike the heart of the oil producing and refining gulf coast region oil platforms in the storm path were being evacuated last week and some land based refineries will temporarily shut down
9349222 for now we can expect the forecast to diminish travel plans for some and it remains to be seen how the weather will impact the fuel supply

9349237 acho que o segundo gol que a gente toma de bola parada o primeiro foi contra o vasco temos de ter mais aten o n o podemos acreditar que temos o jogo na m o
9349238 como todos os jogadores que est o em campo ele tem que trabalhar ainda o z rate precisa de um pouco de ritmo de jogo
9349239 cito o gil como exemplo que fez uma excelente partida hoje
9349240 acho que um resultado para dar moral e confian a viemos de um empate em casa com o gr mio que l der e com um gol sofrido no final agora empatamos com o botafogo que a equipe que mais evoluiu nos dez ltimos jogos
9349241 ele thiago neves tem mais ou menos as mesmas qualidades do van der vaart um excelente jogador para a posi o de um camisa 10

9349261 yo no tengo nada contra cristiano ronaldo me parece un excelente jugador pero yo tambi n tengo mi valor y mi orgullo y ahora como el club no ha fichado a nadie ya es un problema mi salida y robinho ya vale tanto
9349262 yo he hablado con pedja mijatovic con el presidente ram n calder n y l me dijo que me liberar a y la nica persona que no me est dejando salir es bernd schuster por lo que y s porque no ha fichado a nadie y tampoco quiere dejarme salir

9349265 es ist gut dass dinge auf den tisch kommen aber im augenblick sind es nicht mehr als verdachtsmomente
9349266 das ist in spielerkreisen nie ein thema gewesen und ich kann mich auch an keinerlei auff lligkeiten erinnern
9349267 theoretisch k nnen vereine in einer sp teren spielzeit zum beispiel noch mit punktabz gen bestraft werden
9349268 ich kann mir so etwas absolut nicht vorstellen ich war t glich mit der mannschaft zusammen und habe nichts von irgendwelchen absprachen mitbekommen
9349269 hes not the best pitcher in the game for nothing
9349270 hes not going to leave the ball in the middle of the plate hes not going to throw too many straight pitches hes so good hed be the ace on any team in the big leagues
9349271 its real disappointing but that was a game we needed to win
9349272 thats an unfortunate loss for us because thats a game we have to win
9349273 if its not going well we wont hesitate to play richie
9349274 i think its pretty clear you need two functioning quarterbacks in this league and were lucky to have that
9349275 michael owen has been offered an extended and improved three year contract
9349276 the proposed terms of the new deal include an increased salary for michael and demonstrate the clubs commitment to keeping him
9349277 the club hopes that this enhanced contract offer will keep him at st james park
9349278 im very proud of myself and pleased with the weekend especially friday afternoon
9349279 i think at least it proved to people i can do it when i need to
9349280 i think that was the key week getting me on the team
9349281 i certainly stalled in the middle of the campaign and it became hard work
9349282 im disappointed with that but i still have a smile on my face because of the ryder cup
9349283 i felt a lot of pressure today my drive at the last was my worst of the week
9349284 we needed something to kickstart the season to lift the season and give the players some confidence
9349285 we need to respect tottenham they are a very good team and play very well and sometimes makes it impossible to win
9349286 we had more chances but we made mistakes with the final shots they put five six seven eight nine players in the back and its difficult to create
9349287 in the first half maybe we were paying a little bit too much respect to our opponents maybe even overawed by chelsea and the stadium
9349288 but by the second half that was a thing of the past we managed to keep hold of the ball a lot more regularly and our performance in the second half pretty much deserved the point
9349289 this is why we made more mistakes we need to try to work more with the ball
9349290 there is no secret antichrist agenda by the masonic society
9349291 the use of secrecy to conceal thoughts from certain of the members of an organization or from the public is the device of those have something to hide that something is so horrible so terrible that knowledge of that secret must be kept from those would have the most to lose by knowledge of that secret
9349292 the united states is in no manner founded on christian principle
9349293 paul vi made us of a sinister symbol used by satanists in the sixth century that had been revived at the time of vatican two this was a bent or broken cross on which was displayed a repulsive and distorted figure of christ which the black magicians and sorcerers of the middle ages had made use of to represent the biblical term mark of the beast yet not only paul vi but his successors the two john pauls carried that object and held it up to be revered by crowds who had not the slightest idea that it stood for antichrist
9349294 within a few days of pauls return to rome pope paul let it be known that rome was ready to take a new look at secret societies
9349295 in fact many of those close to paul vi were masons such as monsignor pasquale macchi who was paul vis private secretary initiated april 23 1958 monsignor mario rizzi initiated september 16 1969 cardinal ugo polatti initiated february 17 1969 and monsignor franceso marchiasano initiated february 4 1961 paul vi himself has been purported to be a mason
9349296 they said if you dont show us id and get your picture taken we will arrest you and take you away
9349297 they never said what the basis for arrests would be we were waiting for a meeting for gods sake i cannot tell you how much like a police state that felt to me
9349298 the cause for the search warrant is not public at this time
9349299 aided by informants planted in protest groups authorities raided at least six buildings across st

9349312 mainstream interpretation of how we should expect reality to work
9349313 what does such and such a theory say about such and such a situation
9349314 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9349315 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9349316 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9349317 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9349318 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9349319 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9349320 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9349321 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9349322 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9349323 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9349324 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9349325 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9349326 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9349327 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9349328 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9349329 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9349330 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9349331 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9349332 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9349333 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9349334 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9349335 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9349336 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9349337 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9349338 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9349339 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9349340 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9349341 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9349342 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9349343 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9349344 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9349345 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9349346 this is inevitably going to change the convention in some way
9349347 yea i just finished up childcare for the day you sound as if something is wrong is everything okay
9349348 do you know what is going on today in my hometown
9349349 you need to call home right away call your family
9349350 what is going on you need to tell me before i call
9349351 please i need to know what im calling home about
9349352 i got a call today i heard betty was killed in a car accident this morning
9349353 we came into this year knowing that renewal would be a longshot
9349354 with 100 episodes under our belts rising production costs and the us dollars steep decline the odds were stacked against us
9349355 the successes of the two original stargate movies the ark of truth and continuum have shown us the opportunities that the movie format offers we have plans for both sg 1 and atlantis to remain vital as we expand the franchise
9349356 simply put stargate atlantis is the best comic book television we have
9349357 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor
9349358 while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home
9349359 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9349360 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9349361 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9349362 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9349363 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9349364 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9349365 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9349366 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9349367 who are open to doing something on the production side
9349368 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9349369 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9349370 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9349371 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9349372 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9349373 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9349374 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9349375 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9349376 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9349377 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9349378 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9349379 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9349380 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9349381 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9349382 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9349383 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9349384 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9349385 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9349386 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9349387 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9349388 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9349389 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9349390 james is obviously an extremely tough out here it feels like hes got 20 000 friends screaming in my ear
9349391 i got a little tight there to be honest fish said
9349392 right now im just thinking about the loss she said
9349393 she said you were 12 so youve changed a lot coin said
9349394 i didnt think i was out of it but i knew it was going to be tough to come back because he was playing really really well murray said
9349395 he was serving close to the lines and hitting the ball so hard and flat and very deep taking a lot of risks and it was going in for the most part just had to try and hang on
9349396 its just me doing my job thats how i look at it jones said
9349397 a lot of players arent lucky enough to play this long but i have been that lucky and relatively healthy during that run and able to produce
9349398 youre expected to go out and entertain and represent your team a lot of guys in here are trying to find something to motivate themselves for me its easy
9349399 it was bothering me before i went on the dl jones said
9349400 i thought the dl stint would help it because i didnt do any throwing during the dl stint
9349401 the timing wasnt very good general manager marty hurney said
9349402 we think that hell continue to improve hurney said of taylor
9349403 that was an extremely difficult decision because terrence came in and played extremely well and really brought a lot of intangibles into our locker room hurney said
9349404 im dealing with a very difficult very personal issue and i know this is not the solution
9349405 i didnt think in spring training that id be part of anything like that
9349406 i wanted to but i didnt think it was a possibility sometimes you get things that you dont expect so it was nice
9349407 i know that everybody feels especially happy for him he looks really comfortable out there and i like that
9349408 little bit of nervousness in my first game in my hometown
9349409 thirty people here to see me and i just let it overwhelm me
9349410 i think were making it a whole lot more difficult than we should
9349411 its one of those situations where youre trying to do your best and you come in against a lot of good hitters
9349412 its nothing to disrespect the opponent its just the fact that you get into a situation that you want to do your best and on top of that i got one of my hometown friends geovany soto
9349413 i had a huge at bat there in the eighth inning and didnt come through
9349414 its part of the game sometimes you hit a big homer and you kind of stand there and look and enjoy the success at that moment i think it was a big strikeout for him
9349415 i had a good year get hurt then have a bad year then dont play one year then turn into a platoon kind of a bench player all of a sudden hopefully this sets me back in the right direction
9349416 we just squandered too many opportunities and left a lot of people on base
9349417 the home plate umpire said that he wasnt tagged the first base umpire said he was tagged in the hip
9349418 one of them was right and one of them was wrong
9349419 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too
9349420 he said she cant play simply because shes a girl
9349421 we can make an 8 1 game as exciting as anything in the world
9349422 we do probably have to find out what we can do to be a little more consistent than we have been
9349423 weve got to come out sunday and win too we cant lose that many more games and we know that
9349424 a walkoff anything ranks high because that means your team wins the game
9349425 you load the bases and hopefully you get a groundball and give your infielders a chance to go home and maybe turn two if its hit hard enough
9349426 you just have to keep working working working and eventually its going to turn around
9349427 the best way to respond is with the bats and we did
9349428 i said i might just be writing my career off right now
9349429 ive had 17 great years and theres no guarantee what the future holds but you wont know unless you take that chance and i was thinking that
9349430 i think now that im here that part is over and done with
9349431 no one in that locker room is worried about it not once has a guy said hey sit down and tell me what happened they may want to know or whatever but were too busy and im having a blast
9349432 its been hard but really i know i made the right decision
9349433 everyday i would wake up and say boy id like to play at some point in the day id go ahh i dont know with each day that passed i got more and more committed to do it and that was all i was looking for from day 1
9349434 as time passed by i said you know ive still got the fire
9349435 i finally got to a point where i was committed and to me that includes everything
9349436 ive always considered myself the ultimate teammate regardless of how ive been portrayed this year
9349437 the day i told mccarthy i was going to retire he said are you sure
9349438 i said no im not sure but you want an answer and im giving you an answer im not sure
9349439 now i couldve told them all right ill come back even though at that time i didnt want to
9349440 and then july rolls around and we start camp and i go god i just aint got it and then just walk away well to me that was worse than saying guys if you want an answer right now im just not 100 percent committed and because of that im retiring i was just honest with them
9349441 i always liked ted and i dont want to say i dislike him now
9349442 what the hell am i going to do with a locker anyway
9349443 i started getting the impression in may that boy i feel like i need to play
9349444 the tough part was how do i get myself out of this jam
9349445 its a functional cast from what ive been told meyer said
9349446 our medical staff was great enough to come in on a sunday and get it done so his probability of playing has increased for saturday
9349447 we have made contact we have spoken with him we are just waiting to see whether its possible
9349448 weve got three matches left and we need something to happen
9349449 they overseas players have to be here for a period of 21 days
9349450 but he is keen hes desperate to get back into the pakistan side and is hoping this could be a springboard to do that
9349451 if it does go through we hope it could be of great benefit to us all
9349452 its not likely that there will be any update until probably monday after some initial treatments and therapy
9349453 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9349454 chris is a tough guy i hope its not serious you hate to see a guy of his caliber laying on the ground
9349455 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9349456 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9349457 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9349458 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9349459 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well
9349460 hes young and a winner with an olympic gold medal to prove that but more so he will provide us with great balance in the side
9349461 id met him mark hughes previously and was really impressed with him but having talked to him about manchester city i had to come here and be part of his plans
9349462 im very confident of helping the first team to achieve their goals for the season and after walking around the stadium i cant wait to play in front of the city fans there it is very impressive
9349463 auf der insel der jugend hat es noch nie eine solche naturkatastrophe gegeben
9349464 es lief einfach alles gut wir haben all das umgesetzt was der trainer uns vorgegeben hat wir h tten noch h her gewinnen k nnen
9349465 ich hab in den letzten wochen gut gearbeitet und dieses spiel mit meinem tor war ein gutes zeichen f r mich
9349466 dass wir so klar unterlegen waren habe ich selten erlebt
9349467 wir waren ber 90 minuten klar unterlegen es war viel zu viel respekt bei uns da dass wir so klar unterlegen waren habe ich selten erlebt
9349468 es ist wichtig dass luca zur ck ist weil wir mit ihm vorne mehr qualit t haben
9349469 wir gehen nicht mehr in die festgeldabteilung wir halten das geld beisammen und schauen wie sich die mannschaft bis weihnachten entwickelt
9349470 i was in danger in both matches but i felt like today melzer was playing so well that it was going to be really tough for me to get back into the match
9349471 gasquet was obviously playing great too but i still felt like i had a shot of getting back in there and i had known in the past that he had struggled to close big matches out and struggled a bit over five sets
9349472 im not that good of a player that i can just blitz guys but i said it was going to be a difficult match and hes very talented
9349473 i am really happy here at the club and especially enjoy working with david capel and the coaching staff
9349474 there are exciting times ahead for english cricket with the ashes tour next year and also for northants cricket and i am pleased to be a part of it
9349475 im on vacation i dont got nothing to lose i got one more month left you know go to the house relax and see what my situation is going to be
9349476 as far as how we pitch him were missing our location on him is what were doing right now
9349477 but again ive watched this for a number of years hes one of the best right hand hitters that has played the game in my lifetime he doesnt give an at bat away
9349478 the other side is the best team in the national league we play everybody hard
9349479 i struggled a little bit in first inning and didnt get into a good rhythm
9349480 i kind of found it and started pounding the zone with all my pitches
9349481 ive already did what i am going to do in my career
9349482 even though im not walking guys my command just isnt there
9349483 im throwing plenty of strikes but the strikes just arent as quality as theyve been in the past
9349484 the message from gordon from alistair from colleagues like myself has been the same
9349485 we have had a very good period of economic success which has for sure provided us with a very serious platform to weather these problems
9349486 i am very happy to come here and play in the premier league playing in england has been a lifelong dream which has finally come true by moving to city
9349487 a second post mortem will take place before the results are released we are also waiting for toxicology results
9349488 when there is a suspicious death there are always two post mortems
9349489 i can confirm the 15 year old being questioned was not arrested at the scene but handed himself in at a police station
9349490 the situation is still the same i want to play for chelsea as i have told the president ramon calderon the coach and the sporting director predrag mijatovic
9349491 i want to play there i dont know what more i can do
9349492 no if schuster wants to keep an unhappy player then the responsibility is his
9349493 since may ive been trying to renew my contract but they didnt want to because they were so sure they would sign cristiano ronaldo
9349494 newcastle united can confirm that captain michael owen has been offered an extended and improved three year contract
9349495 the proposed terms of the new deal include an increased salary for michael and demonstrate the clubs commitment to keeping him
9349496 employers have had to put a hold on recruitment as the credit crunch bites it is understandable that businesses want to be in good shape coming out of this economic uncertainty and so redundancy just cannot be ruled out

9349500 the position of the management of zoom is that that is not an accurate reflection of the debts of the company we dont know how this figure has been arrived at
9349501 our estimate is that its likely to be in the 20 25 million category but its not possible for anyone at this time to give a definitive figure

9349504 it is important we make positive impressions with everyone we deal with

9349509 the pleasing thing was that we stood up to the bombardment that came our way and there are hopefully a few other additions to come that will help us cope with teams like bolton and the questions they ask you
9349510 i think it was a game we could easily have got three points from but we could easily have lost it as well
9349511 im not interested if the ball was over the line or not
9349512 the referee is the one who makes the decision along with the linesman so it doesnt matter what i think
9349513 alter egos cognate a humble that vandals took the antecedence excluding the housetop atom couldnt take stock in i while ruach heard the special and profound better selfd express a cheque in contemplation of sovereign remedy though farther inner man streak of lightning pneuma could attain perfect except that and ended ahead a motorbike rag grabbing top the sublime smiths landmarks we plum for rising ground intentiveness in relation with the sisterhood and untwist considering voluminous clansman for instance dormant implicated ba brood number onell gravy subconscious selfs colonize in respect to a based on dodder who hankering vie with position in favor this logical outcome
9349514 i felt we could get seven points from the first three games so in a sense i am a little bit disappointed we have ended up with six we have been good value for at least seven points from three games but thats a good start for us
9349515 its our best start for a number of years and we know the team can grow together and improve together and they will have to take on different challenges like they did today
9349516 the sending off changed the game without a question of a doubt it was a good decision we have had a mandate round telling us if people leave the ground with two feet then they will be sent off so we have got no qualms there mike dean made the right decision

9349518 its a tough one to swallow i didnt think the gulf in the two teams was five goals
9349519 everybody tells you about the premier league and what its going to be like and wigan have had five shots on target and beaten us 5 0
9349520 were only three games in of course but arguably its the worst weve played it sounds stupid enough but it is
9349521 i thought the outstanding player on the pitch was valencia he had a fantastic match
9349522 i will probably stay until someone with a rifle and uniform shows up i am staying here because of what happened to my pub when katrina rolled in looting and mindless destruction
9349523 this neighbourhood is like a small village the families with small children have already left but i know there are at least 20 of us planning to stay on my house is at the back of the pub and i am probably going to stay there the general consensus here is the mayor is covering his back after the colossal muck up over katrina
9349524 no way is craig fit for international football and ive told him and john toshack the wales manager exactly that even though hes called him up
9349525 he has just come back and 20 minutes was all he could do even then he kept asking me to wait and wait its a similar story with george mccartney even though he was capable of 45 minutes after his injury
9349526 its always like a circus when i come back here today i thought it was pretty tepid it was great there are probably 15 000 fans out there that were not even born when it happened
9349527 i hooked up with a guy last night and said your name by accident
9349528 feel that sting thats pride fucking with you fuck pride
9349529 these guys got a bad rap a few weeks ago for what happened but they dont deserve it said busch who started from the pole
9349530 this one means a lot these guys have had a lot of adversity on them the past few weeks
9349531 i think the biggest challenge was just being good on the restarts and getting away he added
9349532 it was a great points night for us edwards said
9349533 nobody was going to touch that no 18 those guys were scary fast it was a lot of fun but he was in a different zip code
9349534 tomorrow will be ours weve won two in a row and i believe our car will be real good
9349535 i take him as being probably the best driver on the circuit you never know what he can come up with during a race or what him and crew chief chad knaus can come up with in their cars to make it fast
9349536 we talked about it this week my trainer and i
9349537 we looked at the big tracks and know thats where weve been behind and weve been working hard to catch up said defending race champion johnson who will start from the pole sunday
9349538 i think were there i really do you would always like to be ahead and thats why were still testing and doing all we can we should be a factor in this thing
9349539 thats the thing about the new format with the chase is all it takes is two bad races and all of the sudden youre chasing gordon said
9349540 those guys seem to have the chemistry they seem to have the momentum and they have their cars and the talent to really pull it off gordon said
9349541 those are definitely the guys to beat and ill be surprised if one of them dont win it
9349542 that team theyre dangerous because they can turn things around theyre a two time champ and theyve got a lot of confidence even though those guys theyve been getting beat by the 99 edwards and the 18 busch i dont think they ever count themselves out
9349543 i just know how dangerous hendrick motorsports is in general we just always are working to find whatever deficit we have or how we stay on top and you can never count them out
9349544 it really puts a lot of pressure on those guys when it all evens out and they have to pick it right back up again gordon said
9349545 we went through that last year and pretty much prevailed the best teams and cars going into it were me and jimmie

9349674 eu ou o frequentemente dizerem que jornada referida como um remake o que n o na realidade
9349675 um outro filme um outro filme da s rie a miss o cont nua
9349676 o que acontece com as coisas que duram muito tempo que elas se tornam multiplicadas e sem seriedade e as coisas mudam a elas s o adicionados e adicionados elementos para tentarem faz las melhor mas terminam por trope arem nas pr prias pernas como uma par dia de si mesmas eu sei que existe uma certa consterna o dos f s mas eles ver o uma nova jornada com os personagens originais eu n o sei como n o ficar muito excitado com isso eu estou e a franquia est nas m os de uma pessoa que se preocupa com isso n s t nhamos conselheiros no set de filmagens o tempo todo se precis vamos saber o que conteceu sobre uma coisa por exemplo se havia uma miss o fora e somente uma certa quantidade de pessoas a para l ent o quem carregava o tricorder n s peg vamos tudo das pessoas que realmente sabiam e j j abrams procurava estar absolutamente convicto para certificar se de que era totalmente e completamente certo existe muito dessa coisa para os f s h um pouco de ironia que voc captar se conhecer a s rie e conhecer da mitologia
9349677 eu n o sei creio que uma pena se isso for o caso porque eu acho que foi o que marcou a s rie quando come ou gene roddenberry criou essa vis o de um universo integrado que estava a frente de seu tempo o primeiro beijo interracial na tv foi em jornada eu adoro o fato de um engenheiro scott ser escoc s porque a esc cia tem uma hist ria incr vel de engenheiros inovadores gene pintou esse lado inteligente do futuro desse modo sugerir que n s ainda n o poderemos chegar l como se estiv ssemos abrindo m o dele ent o espero que n o seja esse o caso
9349678 obviamente na jornada nas estrelas de j j abrams estar estampada a sua marca ela ser contempor nea e corajosa mas muito jornada a ponte de comando da enterprise era a mesma ponte era incr vel mas de um certo modo n o igual a que foi constru da nos anos 60 o design de produ o ficou inteligentemente com um determinado tom e completamente convincente mas ainda muito parecido com o que voc esperaria

9349680 nossa vers o de jornada n o exatamente um prequel
9349681 isso de algum modo mas voc ter de v lo para classific lo exatamente o c non que uma palavra inventada por jornada significa situar se dentro da continuidade desse quebra cabe a de 40 anos mas ficou maravilhoso quando voltamos a olhar jornada onde ningu m havia feito a hist ria sobre como a tripula o original se reuniu
9349682 existem 5 000 horas de jornada e nenhuma abordou como eles todos se encontraram assim esse caminho estava livre j que ningu m estabeleceu como isso aconteceu exatamente e tamb m porque temos sido verdadeiramente f s e que sab amos que todos esses anos sentados em frente da tv assistindo transformers e jornada n o seria um tempo em v o foi intimidante mas imagin vamos que se n o pud ssemos fazer isso ningu m poderia risos n o n o foi exatamente isso foi como se tiv ssemos sido chamados ao dever e que n o poder amos covardemente recuar apenas porque a franquia tinha 40 anos

9349836 it would appear that bryans may be taking part in unofficial discussions
9349837 bryans idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world
9349838 i am not sure that this is a very desirable point of view to publish at the present time
9349839 bryans is a talkative and indiscreet fellow who is in possession of a story which he delights in telling and which if told publicly would be likely to cause embarrassment to the foreign office
9349840 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities afforded him to go to italy
9349841 it occurs to me that this is a possible means of putting deception over to the enemy by the careful framing of the questionnaires as presumably the germans must if they capture some of these birds take notice of the type of question which is being asked

9349899 for big dogs being captured by the police almost always leads to a dead end
9349900 we are carrying out measures as we did in the past
9349901 driven by the need to maintain social stability the government has softened its stance on the problem of dog keeping
