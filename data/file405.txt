4050000 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4050001 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4050002 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4050003 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4050004 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4050005 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4050006 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4050007 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4050008 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4050009 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4050010 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4050011 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4050012 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4050013 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4050014 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4050015 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4050016 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4050017 the website mobisitegalore users can swap between mobile and pc laptop to edit their websites the portal created using mobisitegalore though ideally suited for viewing on the small screen of a mobile phone can also be viewed using a pc or laptop
4050018 it is for the masses we want all the active mobile internet users to use this website
4050019 i will not just be performing on my songs but also all blockbuster numbers which have a punjabi flavour
4050020 apart from shooting for sunny deols the man and work on my home production i have to start shooting for big boss season 2 from tommorrow even though i am required to be on the show once a week only for the eviction round i have to travel all the way to lonavala
4050021 they will be a mix of western and indian outfits in one of the songs i will be performing there will be three change of outfits i have heard that the tour so far has gone off very well i am looking forward to joining it
4050022 we have tied up with 15 20 people dealing in scraps in each of the cities that we are present
4050023 ever since we have started accepting 15 20 year old cars exchange has gone up from 12 per cent to 20 per cent and it has helped an entry level product like alto to become a replacement model
4050024 the aai can create these two airports into models and compete with the private sector to develop world class airports they can even compete in the international arena
4050025 we are targeting a turnover of rs 1 000 crore by 2010 11 and then would take it further to rs 2 500 crore by 2013 14 the increase would come on the basis of our expanding business in both our glass and ceramic businesses
4050026 this would take our total glass production to 18 lakh tonnes our existing glass facility also in andhra pradesh has an annual capacity of 10 lakh tonnes
4050027 the expected employment generation under the new scheme would be 37 37 500
4050028 as soon as we are getting information of water logging in any of the village team are being dispatched to such places
4050029 people as well as party workers know who i am based on what i have done what i am carrying out as chief minister are the issues which i took up when i was leader of the opposition
4050030 i did not see the medal we only met in the dinner hall where i congratulated him of course it was very inspiring to see an indian coming on top in the biggest stage in the world
4050031 at the most i could have had a look at it probably touched it and then returned but i want a gold medal that would be just mine and would stay with me
4050032 its a sheer coincidence that my crucial bout coincides with indias independence day im someone whos very emotional about my country and i have to rise to the occasion
4050033 its quite a possibility in other events already a number of world champions and medallists have bitten the dust i just want to continue with the trend
4050034 being the senior most member its only natural that you would help the juniors jitender specially is very fond of me and in fact both of us have a similar style
4050035 to be honest im banking more on him to win a medal hes young faster and even stronger than me the only thing he lacks is experience otherwise he would have been a sure shot for a medal here
4050036 ive set the goal high for myself and thinking only about gold nothing less representing the country in olympics is a dream and i want a fairytale end to it
4050037 we have taken a serious note of the inquiry report and action will be initiated against some more employees
4050038 their tanks are 40 kilometers from tbilisi this is where we are
4050039 sch n habt ihr s hier das ist wirklich ein super stadion
4050040 das neue stadion versetzt borussia in eine h here klasse
4050041 der kader ist so ausgeglichen dass sich keiner zur cklehnen kann es geht schon im training zur sache von der aggressivit t werden wir sicher profitieren

4050044 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4050045 mir ist wichtig dass die justiz sich nicht erst dann intensiv mit jugendlichen straft tern befasst wenn diese ber 100 straftaten auf dem kerbholz haben sondern dass schon fr her interveniert wird
4050046 wir haben jetzt gemeinsam mit der staatsanwaltschaft sichergestellt dass eine entlastung erfolgt

4050066 we expect a considerable number of people to return home today since late wednesday they were slowly going back we are assuring them of their safety
4050067 the security situation has improved but it will probably take a bit of time before people feel secure enough to return home en masse
4050068 we have to be looking ahead to people having to potentially rebuild their lives a lot of houses villages have been destroyed
4050069 the relationship has been tainted but our brother muslims agreed we can rebuild it for the sake of our children
4050070 this obviously is one of the most important movies of the year
4050071 its a canadian production and a lot of fun and its great to find a movie that is big and a real crowd pleaser
4050072 its not based on the joe dante or james cameron movie at all
4050073 its a piranha movie there is absolutely nothing from those movies
4050074 i cannot say too much right now because we are really starting making the movie in time we will release designs
4050075 there are many designs online that i dont know where they are coming from but they are not coming from us

4050084 while we are cutting costs across the organization it is important to note that we intend to increase our investment in research and development projects which will remain the lifeblood of the company
4050085 we are also actively evaluating a number of companies as potential acquisition targets
4050086 for sure congratulations to everybody in here working hard this is a beautiful course i can say so far its my favourite place on tour i love that its old and its very traditional the greens are going to be a challenge with different levels the grass is quick
4050087 i really like the setup too i dont think there are going to be many low rounds i think you know for sure its going to be under par but i dont think 15 or 18 or 17 under par so i think thats a good challenge for all us
4050088 on the back nine no 10 and no 18 if you have the driver you can reach the green in two so thats an advantage
4050089 what im trying to do is take advantage of that little extra distance and give myself a few eagle chances
4050090 uh huh i think its an advantage you know thats one of my priorities i always work hard in the off season to get a little more distance im light but im strong i think i have strong legs i do a lot of exercise i have a quick turn that helps me to create speed
4050091 i was ready a few weeks ago yeah i mean im doing okay
4050092 of course its impossible to win every week i got a great start and i slowed down a little bit its the way sport is and life is up and down i played pretty good the last two weeks i finished top 10 in the two weeks and im putting good and hitting the ball good
4050093 you know i just have to be patient like i said im ready for a win hopefully we can do it this week

4050099 there was anecdotal evidence that there were increasing incidents with school boards and jurisdictions and even outside of school boards
4050100 increasing incidences where numbers of people were being transported in vans without the safety they would have expected in a school bus
4050101 theyre trying to say if youre going to use a vehicle for the purpose of moving kids to sport outings it has to meet the same standards as a school bus
4050102 in a collision it provides greater protection to the occupants
4050103 the two innocent canadians were set upon by a gang of 15 youths some of whom were armed with knives and sticks
4050104 sultan and mohamed were running for their lives from their attackers they did not plan or initiate the murder
4050105 canadian consular officials and the canadian government must increase their efforts in raising the case to the highest levels of the saudi government
4050106 consular officials continue to closely monitor the cases of mohamed and sultan kohail
4050107 there is no business as usual in the connected era
4050108 boundaries for businesses are virtual this is a new class of worker who maybe doesnt have an office and who maybe visits 10 offices in a day and visits several different customers
4050109 the majority of people coming online and buying their first computer today are doing it in emerging countries like china india and brazil
4050110 if you look at india about 67 or more of their workforce is going to be entirely mobile and that is driving the demand for new features in the laptop like all day connectivity long battery life high level security and uncompromising design and durability
4050111 performance leaders and something the tech community will absolutely die for
4050112 with 17 000 notebooks being lost left unattended or reported missing at airports around the world many with important information on them our customers asked for the notion of a vault to secure their information
4050113 we have defined mobility for the business computer we are at that forefront of being different
4050114 i think what it comes down to is that for most of those customers highly mobile highly robust and highly secure systems are critical for large organizations ease of management and administration
4050115 i think what dell has done here is really very much focused on meeting the needs and wishes of this different class
4050116 i am not sure this is going to do it for dell the differentiation in this space is based on the tiniest of differences still it gives apple hp toshiba and lenovo a target to strike at
4050117 theres not a whole lot of options left for these guys
4050118 there are clearly political considerations here the law doesnt offer protection to these guys it will take a discretionary political decision to save them
4050119 every solider who has refused to fight in iraq hasnt contributed to killing innocent people
4050120 its a terrible thing that the government of canada doesnt listen to the parliament of canada or the many people who support war resisters in canada
4050121 this sends a chilling message to those going through the same process
4050122 its creating a wave of stress among everybody if jeremy hinzman who has a wife and kids can be kicked out what about the single guys who have been here for a shorter period of time
4050123 that the party has told them all to decline all invitations and that he declines to appear
4050124 it sets a terrible terrible precedent for all future committees if people can thumb their noses at this committee and ignore a summons
4050125 i dont know the reasons what if somebodys on vacation what if somebody had a heart attack what if somebody needs a kidney replacement or dialysis
4050126 were being told that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
4050127 we have consistently said that this is an internal matter for the pakistani people
4050128 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
4050129 wir werden sicher stellen dass die stimmen aller die an diesem historischen prozess teilgenommen haben respektiert werden
4050130 people are dying because of the inadequacy of our current transplant system so why arent we reaching out to find the best solution why is this being done secretly in the smoke filled backrooms
4050131 imagine if they asked a bunch of transplant people to run the blood transfusion system that would be laughable
4050132 this is a joke but its not a joke for the canadians who are dying
4050133 this is clearly a major step forward toward providing comprehensive organ transplant services to canadians
4050134 there are questions and appropriately so about what this new system will be
4050135 we dont see blood and organs as similar products because theyre not but there is a service delivery model in place that can be taken advantage of to improve the organ donor system
4050136 this is in no way shape or form a power grab
4050137 we knew we were going to the quarter finals before the game and that was a bit of a factor in our strategy
4050138 i dont think there is any reason for us to lose confidence over the results because the results havent shown how weve been playing
4050139 weve been head to head with them so many times especially recently we are in the mindset now that its our turn to win
4050140 wir waren w tend auf die raf weil sie das was wir anstrebten durch ihr tun zerst rten aber trotzdem waren wir sympathisanten weil wir den staat als mindestens genauso schlimm ansahen

4050172 die frage ist ob die spd noch die kraft hat sich der politischen geiselnahme von frau ypsilanti zu erwehren
4050173 das ist nicht wie 1968 bei der invasion der tschechoslowakei als russland seine nachbarn bedrohen eine hauptstadt besetzen eine regierung st rzen konnte und damit davonkam
4050174 die frage ist ob die spd noch die kraft hat sich der politischen geiselnahme von frau ypsilanti zu erwehren
4050175 das aufkommende f nf parteien system zwingt die spd zur linkspartei prinzipieller stellung zu nehmen
4050176 wenn sie es falsch macht wird es dazu f hren dass die linkspartei st rker wird als die spd

4050181 my address will be incomplete if i dont speak about what is happening in srinagar or indian held kashmir i know and all of you know as well that in the past few days 22 innocent civilians have died including sheikh abdul aziz i condemn this act of human rights violation there is no doubt that every pakistani is with their brothers and sisters in kashmir on this occasion i have no doubt that kashmir beats in the heart of every pakistani and that kashmir runs through pakistans veins therefore every pakistani is with the people of kashmir
4050182 hay desconfianza hacia la gente que nos est dirigiendo y as es imposible centrarse y hacer nada
4050183 en cuanto acaben los juegos me voy a mi casa la relaci n con los jugadores y con los dirigentes es muy dif cil y faltan muchos medios para poder hacer un trabajo en condiciones a unos juegos ol mpicos no se puede venir con estos problemas
4050184 son gente dif cil no se puede vivir all en venezuela hay demasiados problemas de todo tipo deportivos y no deportivos
4050185 victoria no es del rea de deportes y no sab a nada de lo que estaba ocurriendo tardamos 20 d as en conseguir hablar con ella la presidenta de la federaci n de voleibol judith rodr guez le mand a decir que navajas hac a millones de exigencias imposibles de satisfacer en el mediano plazo y que s lo ir a a beijing si stas eran cumplidas es puro chisme
4050186 colocamos una media por lo bajo de cu nto gana un t cnico nacional y la ministra lo consider absurdo el problema es que ellos tienen un convenio con cuba el gobierno de venezuela regala petr leo a cuba y a cambio sta les ofrece profesionales en el rea de salud y deporte los t cnicos de cuba trabajan por casa y comida y cobran 100 d lares por mes
4050187 the aiff president congratulated all the players the coach and the support staff for the historic win yesterday he expressed happiness that india qualified for the elite asian tournament in 2011 after 1984
4050188 though there are three most beautiful girls in the film ranbir simply rocks in the film be it the music video or the khuda jaane song
4050189 ranbirs dresses and looks change with time and have been worked upon a lot he can be seen trying all sorts of clothes that one can expect a guy from the age of 19 to 30 to wear
4050190 styling was very exciting and challenging as all three actresses are of different types and come at different times in ranbirs life so the styling had to be unique for everyone with no overlapping but one thing i can assure you all the looks would be unique and will have an aki stamp on it
4050191 minissha plays a small town girl from amritsar so i kept in mind the influences on fashion in amritsar her look in the film with the patiala salwars ganjee tops and jackets have already become a rage
4050192 she is the most fashionable girl from a metro with all the latest trends in fashion she can be seen wearing shorts jeans and other trendy dresses
4050193 there is always a bonus if we have an actress like bipasha in the film she is one of the best looking women with great attitude and an amazing body and her fashion background does makes a difference
4050194 her clothes are very functional its shirts high waist skinny jeans white legged jeans and has a tough look deepikas skinny jeans are the hottest thing right now
4050195 siddharth anand the director asked me to keep the look of the film young trendy and vibrant he said it has to be a hip hot and sexy looking film which it has finally turned out to be
4050196 kareena has a fantastic sense of attitude and style and she can carry off anything in the world
4050197 she is fabulous in any costume she wears be it saris shorts or any other amazing dress
4050198 if not the court at least god was on our side
4050199 we are stunned and profoundly saddened by this tragic loss
4050200 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
4050201 words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan
4050202 we shall be giving our response to each of the recommendation of the committee in our report
4050203 a decision on this point however will primarily rest with the expenditure department which will have to see the availability of funds
4050204 no existe ninguna relaci n de parentesco entre esta mujer y salvador dal
4050205 me dijo relata que no quer a tirarse piedras sobre la tumba
4050206 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
4050207 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal
4050208 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4050209 we always have a back up for supply from other warehouses in case there is some problem in any particular warehouse
4050210 we dont think that the need will arise since we are appealing to the bombay high court at the earliest and are confident that the matter will be resolved soon
4050211 we have a total of three warehouses in maharashtra pune nagpur and mumbai comprising around three lakh square feet

4050278 im not asking about how well the games are being run or how wonderful the games are
4050279 are you embarrassed by china i dont think anyone thinks you have answered the question
4050280 the olympic games is largely about the athletes and they have given us extremely strong feedback about how things are going
4050281 are the ioc embarrassed about the chinese governments record on human rights one more chance
4050282 we have to note the enormous steps in the wider area the world is watching and the ioc is appraising

4050287 i did not promise that china would promise to do whatever with the games in china i did not say that he said

4050306 even now athletes have diabetes especially type 1 and they are playing there are people that play with pumps on so it definitely can be done i am managing it right now and it is going well
4050307 the trainers had sugar on hand for me all the time
4050308 sometimes you work real hard or its hot out and you might be a little low so youd drink a gatorade or have a couple of peppermints and youd be good to go
4050309 theyre going to judge you on your performance whether youre a diabetic or an asthmatic or if you have no health issues at all

4050321 half of louisiana is under water and the other half is under indictment
4050322 over the course of many decades louisiana and new orleans have earned a reputation as being exceptionally tolerant of corruption
4050323 this fueled the demise of the local economy as it drove many companies away and kept them away
4050324 the assumption has been that if you want to do business here you need to set aside extra money to grease the wheels
4050325 we have some issues with corruption and bureaucracy but no more than any other urban environment
4050326 we have promised an end to corruption and incompetence in state government make no mistake about it this is a massive first step
4050327 this would rank louisiana among the top u s states for public disclosure rules and enforcement of those rules
4050328 people get so frustrated with the system here that its no wonder they opt to pay their around it
4050329 hes the greatest olympian in the world and hell be able to earn money everywhere as hes an international brand
4050330 hes a billion dollar man he wont have to get a job ever he can live off this for 50 years
4050331 in the heat and intensity of this event it may seem that his earning power is limitless but you have to pull back and look at someone like tiger woods who has performed at a top level for years and years in front of the world
4050332 the olympics is only held once every four years after a year to so americans forget about the olympics and move to stars they see more kids want someone else on their weetabix box
4050333 you need to be out there early and establish your affiliation with the property michael phelps
4050334 his performance here will benefit us as it will add to the visibility we will get through this affiliation and his earning ability will increase theres no question of that
4050335 in the short term he is a gold mine because he represents everything that is pure young strong and visionary about america we havent had anyone of this significance since mark spitz
4050336 guaranteed there will be marketers wanting a piece of him that make no sense and it will interesting to see how his handlers cope with this and if they get greedy because the olympics has a narrow avenue of marketability
4050337 well thats cool what in the world do i use it for though

4050397 de god nu des vredes die onze here jezus de grote herder der schapen door het bloed van een eeuwig verbond heeft teruggebracht uit de doden bevestige u in alle goed om zijn wil te doen
4050398 alleen god weet wie den brief aan de hebree n heeft geschreven
4050399 en verder dan origenes zijn we nog altijd niet gekomen
4050400 dat is volbrenge in u hetgeen daar nog zou ontbreken gelijk het griekse woord eigenlijk beduidt
4050401 hij heeft u bekendgemaakt o mens wat goed is en wat de h ere van u vraagt niet anders dan recht te doen en getrouwheid lief te hebben en ootmoedig te wandelen met uw god
4050402 na de vrijmaking kreeg deze doorgaande reformatie meer ruimte en mogelijkheden om zich te ontwikkelen zo wilde men als kerk en als gelovigen antwoord geven op de vragen de noden en de uitdagingen van de eigen tijd zowel inter kerkelijk als in staatkundige sociale en culturele situaties
4050403 wordt van meerdere kanten gewezen op de dwingende manier waarop door de meerderheid in de gereformeerde kerken vrijgemaakt werd gesproken over de doorgaande reformatie
4050404 want het woord gods is levend en krachtig en scherper dan enig tweesnijdend zwaard en het dringt door z diep dat het vaneenscheidt ziel en geest gewrichten en merg en het schift overleggingen en gedachten des harten
4050405 dat harinck een intelligente en integere man is die gewoon is zijn standpunten te toetsen aan de bijbel maar wat veel lezers stoort is die volgorde en daarin voel ik wel met hen mee ik kies er voor uit te gaan van de schrift in plaats van die te gebruiken als toetssteen achteraf mij althans dunkt dat harinck die tweede weg volgt hij weet heel goed wat homoseksualiteit is en toegerust met die ervaringskennis gaat hij dan naar de bijbel en komt vervolgens tot zijn standpunt dat homoseksuele mannen een relatie mogen aangaan met elkaar ik vind het beter bijvoorbeeld eerst romeinen 1 te lezen over mannen die in wellust voor elkaar ontbranden en dan vanuit de schrift je vragen te stellen en je gedachten te vormen een christen doet er goed aan eerst de bijbel te laten spreken en pas daarna de wereld op zich af te laten komen
4050406 want zoals de regen en de sneeuw van de hemel neerdaalt en daarheen niet weerkeert maar doorvochtigt eerst de aarde en maakt haar vruchtbaar en doet haar uitspruiten en geeft zaad aan de zaaier en brood aan de eter alzo zal mijn woord dat uit mijn mond uitgaat ook zijn het zal niet ledig tot mij wederkeren maar het zal doen wat mij behaagt en dat volbrengen waartoe ik het zend
4050407 ik kreeg het geloof met de paplepel ingegoten in mijn jeugd lag de nadruk sterk op de uitwendige consequenties van het geloof met name de kerkkeuze we waren vrij strijdbaar als jongen legde ik in discussies uit waarom de vrijgemaakte kerk de ware kerk was het ging bijna altijd over de kerk of over ethische zaken wat mag wel en wat mag niet maar niet over de vraag hoe je zelf tegenover god stond met het geloof werd vooral op een verstandelijke manier omgegaan er lag een sterke nadruk op de verbondsprediking en de doorgaande reformatie
4050408 rust in de wetenschap en ervaring dat zij door deze genade van god van harte geloven en hun verlosser liefhebben
4050409 gij zult de here uw god liefhebben met geheel uw hart en met geheel uw ziel en met geheel uw verstand dit is het grote en eerste gebod het tweede daaraan gelijk is gij zult uw naaste liefhebben als uzelf aan deze twee geboden hangt de ganse wet en de profeten
4050410 hoort het woord des h eren o volken verkondigt het in verre kustlanden en zegt hij die isra l verstrooide zal het verzamelen en het behoeden als een herder zijn kudde want de h ere maakt jakob vrij en verlost hem uit de macht van wie sterker is dan hij zo komen zij jubelend op de hoogte van sion en stromen toe naar het goede des h eren naar koren most en olie naar schapen en runderen hun ziel zal zijn als een besproeide hof zij zullen nooit meer versmachten

4050413 de strijd tussen remonstranten en contra remonstranten had al dadelijk een gevaarlijke kant omdat de regenten erbij betrokken waren onder leiding van het hoofd van de regering oldebarneveldt op vele plaatsen grepen de regenten in om de arminiaanse minderheid te steunen het gevolg was dat de gereformeerden apart gingen vergaderen met eigen voorgangers als dat niet mogelijk was liepen ze op zondag grote afstanden over de slechte modderwegen om trouwe woordbediening te horen vandaar hun naam slijkgeuzen
4050414 de strijd om de waarheid was ten gunste van de gereformeerde leer beslecht de aanvallen van de satan waren met gods hulp afgeslagen de kerken waren bewaard bij de zuivere leer van de schrift

4050416 i remember my very first lesson at the end of the lesson the instructor asked me to imagine what i would look like as a black belt i saw myself standing strong and tall i was focused and i saw a determined look in my eye today i received my recommended black belt at graduation my heart leapt when i saw that black belt package i look at myself now exactly one year after i started and i see myself as a black belt leader standing strong and tall

4050418 i like learning the techniques it helps me get ready for my belt test and learn how to memorize a lot of moves my teacher at school says it is important for me to memorize things too she lls out a paper that says if i have been meeting my goals in school i think karate makes me better at school

4050653 with the tax rebate effects dissipating and the labor market weakening we should see consumer spending slow through the remainder of the year
4050654 the figures are disastrous the economy is being hit on all fronts consumption which had been the main contributor to growth for some time is being hit by soaring inflation and tighter lending conditions
4050655 the bad thing is that we do not see a significant change in this situation in the coming months indeed most of the negative factors affecting the economy will remain in place for the rest of 2008 against this backdrop the recession in france defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth is an increasingly likely scenario

4050670 because it is in west belfast protestants were too frightened to visit the cemetery during the troubles
4050671 living in this new environment that we are today we now hope to bring them back to the cemetery with this special event
4050672 in those days the unionist politicians refused to meet with sinn fein and so we would have met with protestant church leaders to get a feeling for the protestant community
4050673 it was to further understand the history of protestants that i first went along to the city cemetery
4050674 after that first visit a whole new world opened up to me
4050675 among the many fascinating discoveries was evidence of people buried there who were involved in the early formation of the unionist community
4050676 there are also over 270 commemorative inscriptions for soldiers who died during the first world war
4050677 through sizeable headstones and monuments it is possible to glimpse the lives of those who helped shape belfast back in the 19th century
4050678 for instance william james perry who is responsible for building the titantic is buried there so is thomas sinclair who wrote the first draft of the unionist solemn league and covenant of 1912
4050679 the cemetery shows the city very much as a presbyterian city in the 19th century and a progressive city but also the worst for health of any city in britain
4050680 in one month alone in the 1890s 370 children were buried
4050681 one headstone has the names of seven children in the same family who all died very young which shows the terrible poverty in belfast at the time
4050682 as a whole the city cemetery reveals the depth of our history which i believe we should claim and try to understand
4050683 it has given me a much clearer understanding of the development of unionism in belfast as well as a better grasp of the history of the protestant community as a whole in ireland
4050684 the many magnificent irish stone crosses range from amazing examples of funeral architecture to wall art so intricate are the carvings
4050685 when i first visited the cemetery i was really taken back by the state of it due to vandalism and a lot of undergrowth
4050686 i just kept the pressure on over the years as a councillor until steps were finally taken to start restoring it in early 2000
4050687 our city cemetery manager and his staff will be on hand to assist visitors in the renovation of family members graves and plots
4050688 while we particularly hope that protestants will be encouraged to visit on the day the event is open to everyone
4050689 we already have been having inquiries from people wanting to find their relatives lost plots including one from as far away as canada
4050690 sds never gave up karadzic his withdrawal from the party was only a condition for the party in order not to be banned
4050691 the condition was that the sds change its statute in order to remove all those tried for the war crimes from the partys membership that shows that the sds would never give up its founder if there was no pressure
4050692 i dont think too many people would have given us a prayer but everything came together for us
4050693 it was my first goal for the club and theres no better place to score than at windsor against the champions
4050694 i havent scored too many goals in my career so i have very fond memories of that day
4050695 i was something else when the blues fans applauded us off the pitch too
4050696 hopefully i get the nod on saturday but the most important thing is that we get off to a good start and beating linfield would be a massive boost
4050697 the blues have lost a few players like peter thompson and thomas stewart but i dont believe they will be a weaker side to play against
4050698 they have winkie murphy michael gault and paul mcareavey amongst others and they have added a few players like michael carvill and robbie white
4050699 they will still be a top side this year and i know it sounds like a cliche but who ever finishes above them will probably win the league i just hope it is us
4050700 we have finished third for the past two years and we want to improve on that this season
4050701 i believe the lack of strength in depth in our squad was the major factor on both occasions because most the players were playing every game which was over 5o
4050702 the gaffer has brought more players into the club this summer and there will be great competition for places which will hopefully improve everyone
4050703 well be raring to go on saturday and hopefully this can be the year we can bring major trophies to solitude
4050704 ive been at the manx grand prix and the tt but this is something else
4050705 i would love to get a high placing in saturdays race and eventually im hoping to ride at the macau grand prix
4050706 my idol was david jefferies who was sadly killed in the isle of man tt practice a few years ago but i also admire sir richard branson who is my idol as im involved in all sorts of businesses
4050707 we have had a core of eight players available all season and that hasnt happened for many years at this club the last five games have all been won very comfortably a couple by seven wickets two by 180 runs and the other by 150 so were in a good spell and we aim to continue it on friday
4050708 we havent got professional ewen thompson but allan coulter is bowling very well john costain is not going for too many im chipping in with a few wickets and i can then call on regan west colin andrews and wayne horwood so that is the bowling well covered
4050709 in the batting we had gary wilson back for the semi final and he scored a classy century west also played a special innings and wayne and myself will be looking for big runs
4050710 he has a great future and although he has had a 30 and a 20 not out in recent matches he has been unlucky he has not had the opportunity to show his potential
4050711 we know what to expect but im not sure how valuable it will be theres plenty of experience in the csn team and they are coming into the game on a good run and weve no form at all
4050712 because of the weather weve had an enforced break after losing to north down and bangor in a double weekend hopefully the break will have freshened us up
4050713 graham gave me a call when the lads were back to training a couple of weeks so we sat down and went about putting a few structures in place
4050714 we have introduced a number of new things to the players and have pushed them quite hard and to be fair to them they have responded very well
4050715 while in london i worked with london harlequins and spent time on speed coaching with their backs and worked with quite a lot of international rugby players
4050716 athletics certainly employ techniques which were beneficial to rugby and hopefully it will prove the same to football
4050717 i enjoyed my time in athletics but there are so many other things that people dont see that you have to go through
4050718 you have to put yourself through a lot in the lead up to big events like that then the medicals afterwards and dealing the press
4050719 we were checking fences when this thing just jumped out at us
4050720 it had big teeth a big head short legs in front and long legs in back
4050721 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and reflects revision to a mindset that has led to no good consequence for pakistan in the past
4050722 all the police bureaux have instructions to prevent petitioners reaching beijing
4050723 all the local party units at street level in beijing have orders to prevent petitioners demonstrating this is a comprehensive attempt to airbrush away any sign of discontent
4050724 the party secretary told me even if you report this matter it will be as useless as farting we are in control of this matter
4050725 the chinese communist party are purely fake communists before the bandits lived deep in the mountains now they are the security police
4050726 there are a few guys around in the jwrc at the moment especially ogier aaron burkart and martin prokop who are being tipped as the next big things so it will be good to see how my times compare against them
4050727 but i wont have the pressure of having to think about championship points which is always great on an event my plan is to go and drive at my level and take it from there
4050728 ive had a first and second place in the jwrc in germany so i have fond memories of the event
4050729 munaretto and myself were all keen to go to germany with a super 1600 clio so a deal came together for me to go if i could find the cash its been the usual rush to put the budget together and i cant thank the sponsors enough for giving me this chance to return to the wrc

4050748 la presse rock fran aise racontait cette dr le de tendance qui secouait la culture pop britannique se souvient il on regardait a avec un peu de m pris pour nous c tait un truc de bo te de nuit mais quand nous sommes all s la grande rave des transmusicales de rennes en 1992 on a enfin compris de quoi il sagissait ce fut un vrai choc culturel tout le monde souriait dansait a nous changeait des ambiances de concert rock sinistres des ann es 1980
4050749 au contraire estime mathieu guerre berthelot je crois quon ne comm more vraiment que ce qui a compl tement disparu or la culture rave et lectronique est particuli rement vivante aujourdhui il suffit de regarder la mode de la tektonik dans les cours d coles ou le courant nu rave chez les jeunes rockers anglais une nouvelle g n ration a pris le relais
4050750 le seul truc que les autorit s ont encore du mal comprendre constate mathieu guerre berthelot cest pourquoi on sobstine terminer 7 heures du matin et pas 3 heures comme un festival rock mais ici on ne vient pas voir un simple concert on vit une exp rience globale et le lever du soleil en fait partie
4050751 were being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
4050752 we are very clear that we have no role to play in this impeachment process britain has no interest in talking about the fate of individuals
4050753 there is a link between musharraf and the army so humiliating him is like humiliating the army
4050754 the us administration would have much preferred to see a workable political arrangement between musharraf and the government not another looming transition
4050755 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
4050756 this is a man who stood up against al qaida who will face al qaida after musharraf certainly not this coalition
4050757 tomamos nota de la rectificaci n relativa al desbloqueo del funcionamiento normal de las instituciones constitucionales

4050764 at first when he came with a little knife i didnt realise he was trying to rob my shop i thought it was a joke
4050765 i thought he couldnt do much with his little knife so i went to the back of the shop and got a mop and started hitting him
4050766 i was just trying to defend myself and the shop i work from 9am until we close at 10 30pm seven days a week
4050767 i took my hands up and said go ahead and take everything

4050769 i think we did pretty well you cant let him get away with a little knife

4050774 rosemount sydney fashion festival 20082 in sydney schickten die veranstalter kleine kinder als models auf den catwalk
4050775 wer einmal die streicher so hat singen h ren wie bei karajan wird das nie vergessen zum vorwurf der gl tte wenn eine musik glatt klingt weil dem dirigenten nichts einf llt w re das etwas anderes doch karajan hat immer genau gewusst was er tat
4050776 wir haben dank karajan heute eine neue qualit t erreicht ich sa einmal hinter den h rnern bei einem brahms konzert in der berliner philharmonie und dachte mir das hat doch nichts mit dir zu tun das ist ein v llig anderer beruf als der den du aus bst
4050777 karajan war f r mich immer wie ein vogel der h her fliegt als alle anderen wir stehen auf der erde und sehen zehn oder zwanzig meter weit er sieht da oben kilometerweit
4050778 karajan war die fortsetzung toscaninis er hat die figur des dirigenten zu einer art supergestalt gemacht vollkommen neu war seine einstellung zur technik da war karajan blitzartig man hatte das gef hl die medien seien eigens f r ihn erfunden worden
4050779 die historische auff hrungspraxis heute ist eine reaktion auf den karajan klang nur richtet sich das meiner meinung nach nicht gegen karajan selbst sondern gegen seine epigonen
4050780 tens of thousands of alpha users and thousands of communities around the world are actively sharing millions of files
4050781 groups of people aligned around an idea connected to a leader and to each other tribes make our world work and always have
4050782 chance to showcase some of the initiatives we launched here in virginia
4050783 people in the know know what a dynamic leader he is and what an accomplished governor he was
4050784 most of the country doesnt know exactly who he is and so i think this is an amazing opportunity for him to be introduced to a wider group of people
4050785 in his very person he suggests dynamism an ability to look forward to the future
4050786 for them its kind of doing an obama type thing
4050787 young and interesting and doesnt look like a typical republican
4050788 the keynote is that time when you can really come in in primetime and put your best party face on
4050789 and in general present the personification of the party as it stands today
4050790 as a result of preliminary investigations we have suspended four students and those students will remain suspended until we have further details from the police he said
4050791 that anyone could come into the school after hours and take advantage of defenceless animals that have been lovingly cared for by our students is disappointing he said
4050792 there will be consequences for the students according to their level of involvement
4050793 the college has put procedures in place to manage the wellbeing of all students
4050794 it is run for years 9 12 and we would have 150 plus kids involved including vce level to prepare them for university it is not a mickey mouse subject he said
4050795 the premier spending a week or two there in china doesnt hide the fact nsw is unrepresented for the remaining 50 weeks of the year
4050796 given the huawei deal alone is a multi million agreement for sydney the cost of the mission is relatively small
4050797 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good

4050800 weve obtained statements that support the offences that were putting before the court and weve certainly had that support and the involvement of a number of victims and witnesses
4050801 the longer the court delays in enforcing the settlement between the parties the more like the value of the consideration subject of the settlement will change
4050802 any further delay in enforcing the settlement will create a serious risk of prejudice to facebook as well as to connectu
4050803 this means the status quo cannot be preserved with a stay
4050804 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4050805 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4050806 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4050807 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4050808 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4050809 i shoved all my shoes and crap under my bed or in my wardrobe
4050810 i spent a loving hour ordering things and cleansing my mind and room of all the crap surrounding my life
4050811 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4050812 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4050813 wahai manusia sesungguhnya allah swt itu suci dan tidak menerima kecuali yang suci dan allah swt telah memerintah orang mukmin dengan apa yang diperintahkannya kepada para rasul yaitu wahai sekalin rasul makanlah dari harta yang suci dan kerjakanlah perbuatan shaleh kemudian beliau bercerita tentang seseorang yang dalam perjalanan panjang lalu memanjatkan tangannya ke langit sambil berdoa mengucap ya tuhan ya tuhan namun makanannya haram minumannya haram pakaiannya haram dan mengonsumsi yang haram bagaimana doanya bisa dikabulkan
4050814 kaumku telah mengetahui bahwa pekerjaanku keahlianku mampu menopang kesulitan keluargaku dan sekarang saya sibuk dengan urusan kaum muslimin apakah kemudian keluarga abu bakar akan makan dari harta ini baitul mal sementara saya bekerja di dalamnya untuk kaum muslimin
4050815 tidaklah seseorang memakan makanan pun yang lebih baik daripada ia makan dari pekerjaan tangannya dan bahwa nabiyallah daud a s makan dari pekerjaan tangannya
4050816 salah seorang dari kalian lebih baik mengantar sesuatu barang di atas punggungnya menjadi kuli itu lebih baik daripada ia meminta kepada seseorang lalu ia memberinya atau tidak memberinya
4050817 saya akan membagikannya maka thalhah pun kemudian membagikannya hingga tak tersisa sedirham pun untuknya
4050818 thalhah menjual tanahnya seharga 700 ribu pada malam harinya ia tidak bisa tidur karena uang itu masih ada padanya keesokan harinya ia membagikan semua uang itu
4050819 thalhah bin ubaidillah menjual tanahnya dari utsman seharga 700 ribu
4050820 ketika aisyah r a berada di rumahnya tiba tiba ia mendengar suara yang mengagetkan kota madinah ia lalu berkata ada apa ini mereka menjawab kafilah abdurrahman bin auf datang dari syam dengan 700 unta aisyah berkata saya pernah mendengar rasulullah saw bersabda saya melihat abdurrahman bin auf masuk surga dengan merangkak ucapan ini sampai kepada abdurrahman ia kemudian menemui aisyah dan bertanya atas ucapan itu aisyah kemudian berkata kepadanya abdurrahkam lalu berkata saya bersaksi kepadamu bahwa kafilah dengan muatan pelana dan alas pelananya saya infakkan di jalan allah azza wa jalla
4050821 bahwa abdurrahman bin auf diberi makanan sementara ia tengah berpuasa ia berkata mushab bin umair terbunuh sementara ia adalah seorang yang dermawan pemberi ia dikafani dengan kain yang bila kepalanya ditutup kakinya terlihat dan bila kakinya ditutup kepalanya terlihat
4050822 hamzah terbunuh sementara ia seorang dermawan yaitu tidak terdapat untuk mengkafaninya kecuali sehelai kain kemudian dunia dilapangkan untuk kita selapang lapangnya
4050823 kami diberi dunia apa yang telah diberikan kepada kami dan kami khawatir bahwa itu adalah kebaikan yang disegerakan untuk kita kemudian ia menangis sehingga ia meninggalkan makanan hr bukhari
4050824 saya datang bersama paman saya kepada salman al farisi di madain sementara ia bekerja sebagai penjual daun kurma
4050825 saya membeli daun kurma satu dirham lalu aku kerjakan dan aku menjualnya dengan tiga dirham satu dirham saya jadikan modal satu dirham saya berikan kepada kelurga dan satu dirham saya infakkan meskipun umar menghentikanku tapi aku tidak menghentikannya
4050826 anak salman berkata kepada salman berilah saya wasiat ia bertanya apakah kamu mempunyai sesuatu ia menjawab tidak ia berkata dari mana ia menjawab saya meminta manusia ia berkata kamu ingin memberiku kotoran manusia
4050827 ibnu mubarak dicela karena tidak memberikan jamuan dari hartanya baik di negara lain maupun terhadap penduduk negerinya
4050828 saya mengetahui tempat dari orang orang yang memiliki keutaaman dan kejujuran dalam mencari hadits dan telah melakuan pencarian dengan baik mereka adalah orang orang yang membutuhkan bila kami meninggalkan mereka ilmu mereka akan hilang sementara bila kami menolong mereka ilmu akan tersebar kepada umat muhammad dan saya tidak mengetahui setelah kenabian yang lebih utama daripada tersebarnya ilmu
4050829 saya mendengar ibnu mubarak berkata penduduk dunia keluar dari dunia sebelum mereka makan yang terbaik di dalamnya orang orang bertanya apa yang terbaik di dalamnya ia menjawab makrifah kepada allah azza wa jalla
4050830 saya menolak satu dirham dari yang syubhat itu lebih saya cintai daripada bershadaqah dengan seratus ribu dan seratus ribu hingga enam ratus ribu
4050831 seandainya salah seorang dari kalian mengambil tali kemudian mengumpulkan sampai membelakangi punggungnya itu lebih baik daripada ia berdiri di atas kepala saudaranya memintanya atau mengharapkannya
4050832 barang siapa di antara kalian yang bekerja maka kami memujinya dan bila ia tidak bekerja kami menuduhnya
4050833 wahai para pembaca tinggikan kepala kalian dan janganlah menambah kekhusyuan atas apa yang ada di hati berlomba lombalah dalam mencari kebaikan dan jangan menjadi tanggungan manusia jalan sudah jelas
4050834 sesungguhnya orang yang hidup dari tangan manusia seperti orang yang menanam pohon di tanah orang lain
4050835 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4050836 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4050837 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4050838 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4050839 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4050840 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4050841 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4050842 se est n asumiendo una serie de pol ticas que no van lo deprisa que deber an ir
4050843 todas las pol ticas que desde el gobierno de la ciudad se puedan acometer para erradicar y solucionar el problema del chabolismo en el vacie
4050844 le tender mi mano y estar siempre ayudando para que los ni os del vacie puedan vivir en mejores condiciones para que convivir entre ratas pase a la historia
4050845 como vea que no est n ejecutando el plan de erradicaci n del chabolismo se denunciar aunque mientras tanto se le seguir dando apoyo
4050846 desde el momento en que se puso encima de la mesa el plan lo ayudarnos pero tambi n tengo que llamar a la conciencia porque se va muy lento
4050847 la soluci n del vacie no pasa por poner unas duchas ni tardar m s de un a o en resolver el problema de la guarder a
4050848 m s de un a o para restaurar el servicio es mucho tiempo
4050849 no debe perderse ni un minuto m s en una demora injustificada porque un a o de retraso en un despacho oficial pasa en un minuto pero un minuto de demora entre cartones suciedad y ratas es como un a o
4050850 no hay derecho a que quien lo padece vea pasar a os y a os como si fueran minutos sin que se resuelva su problema
4050851 arrimar el hombro al equipo de gobierno para intentar solucionarlo
4050852 para resolver el problema del vacie no hay ning n tipo de color pol tico sino determinaci n y compromiso presupuestario no solo para sacar a las familias de all sino para darles el apoyo y dedicaci n que necesitan
4050853 seguir yendo al vacie como he hecho infinidad de veces
4050854 si somos capaces de remover la conciencia para resolver el problema que tienen tantos vecinos del vacie me dar por satisfecho
4050855 we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4050856 very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
4050857 most service stations have the infrastructure and buying power of supermarkets like asda which led the recent price cuts at the supermarket pumps and has now introduced a fuel pricing policy but they dont seem to be using that commercial strength to help motorists
4050858 meanwhile as we hit the peak summer holiday driving season and with fuel prices at current levels every penny counts
4050859 around 100 people have been sick with this specific strain of salmonella agona since around may
4050860 during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
4050861 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4050862 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
4050863 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4050864 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4050865 essentially it is the wests worst nightmare that this is squaring up into some kind of proxy confrontation between america and russia
4050866 russias foreign minister said america now has to choose between georgia and russia so the situation is getting more and more serious and critically russia is saying quite clearly that it believes the solution the way forward must not involve america
4050867 die nachfrage der reedereien nach umschlagskapazit t ist nach wie vor hoch
4050868 trotz der eintr bung des weltwirtschaftlichen umfelds halten wir an seinen zielen f r umsatz und ergebnis fest
4050869 in einem solchen kontext ist es nach wie vor von entscheidender bedeutung breit angelegte zweitrundeneffekte bei der lohn und preissetzung zu vermeiden
4050870 the street is flooded as far as the eye can see in both directions we still cant get the car out of the drive it flooded badly on saturday night too and we couldnt get out
4050871 the forecast is rain again tonight so im hoping that this drains away because if it doesnt theres going to be a big problem
4050872 throughout the winter we get permanent flooding preston crescent is on a curve and our house just lies at the lowest point of the curve
4050873 we really need a concerted effort from the council and scottish water we have reported it on numerous occasions but both say its the others responsibility its a recurring problem that weve had for a number of years and its getting worse
4050874 we can get out on foot but its not ideal with a pram wading through water which has sewage in it
4050875 when i ran emilys bath at the weekend the water was brown scottish water said it was just sediment but nevertheless its not so good we have had some pretty unpleasant things left when the water goes which is a bit concerning
4050876 earlier this year we had sanitary towels condoms and used toilet paper on the street
4050877 i followed the flow of water to barr crescent where theres now just open ground and the surface water is running off from that
4050878 its making the flooding in preston crescent 10 times worse
4050879 earlier in the year we were being passed backwards and forwards between fife council and scottish water they passed the buck
4050880 its a bit of a nightmare we were supposed to be going to newcastle today for a meeting my husband is having to work from home because he cant get the car out to go to work
4050881 my car mercedes was parked outside on saturday night and that was full of water the entire interior has got to be replaced which is a bit of a disaster
4050882 its a serious issue i almost had a fit this morning i was quite astonished because its the biggest flood i have seen here
4050883 theres got to be a long term solution other streets are able to cope and i cant see why we shouldnt its at the bottom of a hill so when the water comes flooding down its like a monsoon
4050884 the main problem is the inefficiencies with the sewage pumping station at the junction of fraser avenue and preston crescent
4050885 the water is also coming down barr crescent like a waterfall and thats contributing to the flooding at preston crescent
4050886 the very heavy rain in the area over the past day or so has caused problems in preston crescent
4050887 we are seeking to alleviate these problems as quickly and efficiently as possible
4050888 we will also look at the operation of the pumping station in preston crescent to establish if we can alleviate any future problems
4050889 we apologise for any inconvenience caused to customers in the area
4050890 scottish water is investigating an ongoing issue with the local pump station
4050891 when i go to glasgow dundee or edinburgh i can get right into the toilet
4050892 its just in dunfermline that i have to show the key as theyve got the wrong locks
4050893 there was a woman who worked there who was never very happy about william coming in with me
4050894 and another attendant told me that he couldnt come in its ridiculous
4050895 they said to me you cant get in its only for one person but its all right everywhere else
4050896 if it could be done quite quickly and without fuss then lets do it
4050897 we need to realise that we do live in the 21st century and we should provide a 21st century service
4050898 when the building was constructed radar locks were not specified
4050899 there are two disabled toilets in the building one in the main toilet area and a second adjacent to the kiosk to prevent vandalism the second toilet is kept locked but it can be accessed by asking the duty supervisor to open it
4050900 i couldnt get enough doctors or nurses so i had to cancel it its probably something that you wouldnt actually need a doctor for but thats the rules because its an endurance thing
4050901 im quite disappointed i was really looking forward to it
4050902 we got maybe 13 or 14 nurses but it wasnt enough we would have needed about 30 or 40
4050903 the customers were all up for it and its a shame that we wont be able to do it
4050904 john was a rock for me so the minimum i could be was strong for him
4050905 they doctors had no idea how long he had because everybody is very different
4050906 sitting down to watch a recorded rugby international with dad was often frustrating as he replayed many tackles scrums and tries in slow motion often pointing out the inaccuracies in the referees decisions
4050907 he was an industrious kind of person he was a family man but he also had quite a sense of humour
4050908 hes one of eight brothers and sisters there was quite a clan family was important to him having been part of a large family and then having his own children
4050909 die nachfrage nach unseren produkten ist unver ndert hoch daher k nnen wir unsere prognosen f r das gesamtjahr 2008 deutlich anheben
4050910 i didnt think this would happen to me its just something that i dont think that people think is going to happen to them is what it amounts to it happens very quickly too
4050911 the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated
4050912 we usually have about 20 dog meat dishes on our menu it will certainly have an effect on our sales
4050913 if it applies to us the effect will be huge
4050914 if we get an order like that i have no idea what we would do
4050915 meat from dogs is the healthiest of all it has shorter fibers than cow meat has no hormones like veal no antibiotics like pork
4050916 the arrests are the result of a protracted investigation into organised prostitution and corrupting public officials
4050917 we can confirm that one of those arrested is a serving woman officer from northumbria police
4050918 those arrested eight women and six men range in age from early 20s to late 50s

4050921 it is bitterly disappointing for luke and we wish him all the best for a speedy recovery but both brett sheehan and sam cordingley have been putting up their hand and are itching for the opportunity to play in the number nine jersey
4050922 the demand for green collar jobs is really exploding especially as the cost of energy continues to climb
4050923 students need to start thinking about developing skills that will give them an edge for these types of careers that did not even exist until recently
4050924 im very happy with the support ive received so far
4050925 its been particularly pleasing to gather nominations from across all parts of the country and across all sections of the party
4050926 however its obviously a very tight race and in the end it will be votes and not nominations that win this election

4050937 if you concede two goals in the first 20 minutes then you cant say the match was good but at the same time it is good to get back to 2 2
4050938 im sure that we will be in form for the return because my team will play the super cup and a league match beforehand
4050939 a 2 2 away draw gives steaua an advantage so we have to improve
4050940 we were surprised by the speed of partizans play in the first 25 minutes
4050941 but we recovered began to create and the goals came naturally im not happy with the result though as i am a coach who would like to win every time
4050942 im a bit disappointed as we had some excellent opportunities to score and win the match
4050943 it surprised me a bit but we played well and liverpool played less well than expected we did our best and showed them what standard are all about
4050944 it was a real pity for us that reina has such an excellent match but maybe we will have better luck at anfield in two weeks we did everything perfectly the only thing that is wrong is that were empty handed thats a shame but we cannot complain as its still a good result
4050945 that was a compliment in itself to the way we were playing
4050946 as gerrard was injured they normally wouldnt have wanted to risk him but the fact that they did was good for us although it would have been better if wed scored
4050947 i hope that we can win our domestic matches and be ready for the return some might say that well pay for those missed chances but after that penalty miss they might have been saying that about the game too but that didnt happen we kept going kept fighting and that was a big positive hopefully we can do the same thing in two weeks

4050972 any team that can win their groups at the olympics are quite strong these teams are basically chinas primary opponents
4050973 maybe overall china is stronger but on an individual basis theyve beaten us before in singles matches or other contests
4050974 the olympics isnt any ordinary competition theres definitely more pressure
4050975 i didnt play to my full potential but it was good training for me psychologically
4050976 when i was behind 1 0 and even when i was trailing in the second game to be able to come back from that psychologically that was good for me i think itll be helpful for the upcoming games

4050989 you have to go play and play well even if you know how they play
4050990 the next match against the united states is very important for us
4050991 our major task now is to calm down and focus on it
4050992 the u s team also lost earlier in preliminary play to undefeated cuba their trip to the olympics has thus far been marked by tragedy
4050993 i think we are very much under pressure for this game we need to focus on ourselves
4050994 china plays fast they play a lot of combinations how much we can play under the pressure and play well thats more important
4050995 lang was an outside hitter for the chinese national team from 1978 85 and then again in 1990 credited with the ascent of the chinese womens program she helped the team to its first title in 1981 at the world cup

4051001 i raised nikki s three kids for 10 years and came to love them very much
4051002 when we separated i rented a house large enough for all of them to come visit they never came i was devastated and couldnt understand why until i found out he was telling them things about me that werent true he told them i kept them from their biological mom that just wasnt true but it made a good story and made me look bad he is very good at manipulation and using words to his advantage nikki was always making up stories about me that were just outrageous and i felt i had to rebut each one it became scary to see how he defined me with his stories
4051003 finally i would like to close with a comment about the valuation of gulfports assets versus the current valuation of the company by the market at year end 2007 pricing 92 50 for oil and 6 80 for natural gas our engineering report showed a pv 10 of 821 million based on the increased price of oil and natural gas to yesterdays close of 118 58 per barrel of oil and 8 69 per thousand cubic foot we estimate our proved reserves alone to have a pv 10 of approximately 1 2 billion moreover this number does not even begin to take into account the enormous upside we derived from grizzly the bakken and other investments

4051022 the money which the government gives to young mothers is not an incentive to make more babies so that they could then buy themselves nice clothes and fancy hairstyles
4051023 the money is meant to help the children who are the real beneficiaries behind this policy
4051024 if our churches can instill in young people discipline and correct behaviour i am confident that we would not have a situation where people fell pregnant when they are not ready or able to start families

4051188 holtoms correct and you are the queen of wishful thinking
4051189 a big difference here is the conservatives didnt set out to defraud taxpayers

4051208 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4051372 were proud of the cologne assembly plant and the vehicles produced here not only does the new fiesta bring innovative design and engineering to the small car market but it brings new manufacturing technologies as well

4051374 what was really weak was private consumption because of the increase in consumer prices
4051375 this effect will be less strong over the next quarter as inflation probably peaked in july but this is also a cyclical slowdown so the labor market will start to worsen
4051376 the market has already priced in the weak data over recent weeks this has now reached a level quite low compared to fundamentals

4051448 diane harper who spent 20 years developing the vaccine says it has not been tested for effectiveness in young women and there are questions about how long it will last
4051449 we believe that gardasil is a useful vaccine but we are uncomfortable with girls under 15 being vaccinated there have been no clinical trials for very young women and no systematic examination of the effects on their growing bodies at this age parents are giving consent without any requirement for the young women themselves to be informed the vaccine is still 100 percent effective when given to women who are already sexually active and who may already have been exposed to hpv we feel it would be so much better to offer it to women 15 years and over we have good information on the effectiveness of gardasil for these women and they are able to make the decision for themselves and consent in their own right

4051474 we believe it will remain unchanged but its going to be a close call it actually wouldnt surprise us if the reserve bank gives the interest rate one last hike
4051475 the rand has remained reasonably resilient and south africas trade deficit margin has narrowed whether this means south africa is exporting more or importing less we are not sure but the trade deficit margin has decreased
4051476 the inflation trajectory at the moment remains on the upside and the reserve bank could hike one more time to drive home the point that the revision of the cpix basket does not have such a great effect as inflationary pressures are still evident
4051477 we predict an unchanged repo rate because we have almost reached a peak in inflation the reserve bank has also achieved what it set out to do which was to cool consumer demand
4051478 although the reserve bank does not directly take the oil price into consideration the knock on it has on prices will definitely have an effect and the decline in oil prices will improve the economic environment
4051479 the economy has responded overwhelmingly to the interest rate hikes so far as there has been a significant slowdown in consumer demand such that households are under stress and the effects are evident
4051480 we believe the interest rate will remain unchanged because food prices are past their peak the rand shaky at times is steady and oil prices have also peaked
4051481 as the council starts its work on thursday we are really hoping that by the end of the summit as the incoming chairperson of the council of ministers of sadc we would definitely have a clear mandate of what sadc needs to focus on in the following year
4051482 we need to have the right infrastructure and free movement of people and on the other hand free movement of goods to make our region more effective
4051483 we believe that sooner or later zimbabwe can go back to playing its role in terms of economics in our region you may recall that zimbabwe was the second economy in this region
4051484 it is therefore important to remind our heads of state that we need to push hard to ensure that the appropriate measures were are in place to ensure an extension of the lifespan of those who are infected and we avoid infection among the youth in particular
4051485 so far we do not have conflict or war sadc continues to be a reference on how we move from confrontation to peace stability and security

4051500 this year its been pretty calm theres a definite level of expectation amongst our supporters and theyre expecting the best
4051501 but not so much the frenzy there was last year more a gradual buildup
4051502 it could be a preview for a qualifying final in a months time
4051503 its a showpiece game for the afl and we wont be taking our foot off the accelerator at all
4051504 we are on a hot streak and youve got to cash your cheques when theyre due

4051526 we found out yesterday and to be honest it sucks
4051527 to see this happen to someone who came out here and worked his ass off and wanted it so bad and is a great guy to have this happen to him is unfortunate we loved having him around

4051553 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4051554 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4051555 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4051556 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4051557 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4051560 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4051561 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4051562 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4051563 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4051564 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4051578 when i first heard about this new austrian death machine i thought hey its about goddamn time somebody started an arnocorps tribute band right i got a hold of this guy tim to congratulate him and he told me his project was not a tribute to arnocorps at all come on dont bullshit me arnocorps have been rocking exclusively about austrian action adventure for the length of his entire music career he comes to us for advices so its not that hard for us to give him the wrong advices
4051579 the real arnold is now a politician and we dont get involved in politics
4051580 even though we give arnold a hard time about exploiting the fantastic ancient heroic austrian tales in hollywood and for not giving credit to the alpine communities back home for all his success he did endorse arnocorps and put an article about us on his official website back in 2002 we have met in person and we didnt try to ram our fists into each others stomachs or break each others goddamn spines i think he admires what arnocorps does because were like a public service similar to what hes trying to do now no doubt he appreciates that weve never use his likeness to promote any of our products like others do we sell albums based on our own handsome features and symmetrical physiques
4051581 a tribute to a particular man actor or politician is not the idea behind arnocorps at all our goal has always been to empower the listener to help them realize that they themselves can be goddamn heroes and sheroes maybe there is room for both bands theres an old austrian saying that milk is for babies and when you grow up you have to drink beer well we think austrian death machine can be like milk you know help all the youngsters get introduced to some of these ideas but when they grow up they drink beer and most important listen to arnocorps

4051621 it is very difficult to get accurate situational awareness in real time in a crisis that is fast moving
4051622 this is a motorized conflict in a relatively small area and that means the situation on the ground can change very quickly

4051888 following forensic tests and a post mortem on the cat it is believed that the animal was drowned recently probably in the washing up bowl in which it was found
4051889 given the recent nature of the cats death and where it was found it is reasonable to assume that those responsible for the two murders also killed the cat
4051890 it pains us to take this measure however we need to avoid placing undue burden on our company and our service
4051891 even with a limit of 250 messages received per week it could cost twitter about 1 000 per user per year to send sms outside of canada india or the us it makes more sense for us to establish fair billing arrangements with mobile operators than it does to pass these high fees on to our users
4051892 im still here tweeting so obviously im not narked off enough to leave altogether
4051893 too much of a downgrade but at least i have an iphone now
4051894 the end of sms is a blow but wont be fatal now the patchy service has improved
4051895 we dont have any specific plans for a payment system though thats interesting
4051896 but we definitely are striving for and believe we can achieve a built in revenue model that is compatible with the open nature of twitter and its ecosystem rather than something tacked on
4051897 given the recent nature of the cats death and where it was found it is reasonable to assume that those responsible for the two murders also killed the cat

4051913 tyson made this request on behalf of its shelbyville plant employees some of whom had expressed concern about the new contract provisions relative to paid holidays
4051914 in an effort to be responsive tyson asked the union to reopen the contract to address the holiday issue and the union agreed to do so the union membership voted overwhelmingly thursday to reinstate labor day as one of the plants paid holidays while keeping eid al fitr as an additional paid holiday for this year only this means that in 2008 only shelbyville employees will have nine paid holidays
4051915 this issue concerns only the plant at it says union leadership made this request makes you wonder who runs the union

4051990 rummikub is a tile based game for two three or four players it won the 1980 spiel des jahres award german game of the year and the spel van het jaar award the dutch game of the year in 1983 also known as rummy o or rummycube
4051991 battered by rising rents and taxes one third of the citys supermarkets about 500 have vanished in the last 10 years big box stores and drugstore chains are fast replacing traditional supermarkets which in too many cases can no longer afford to stay in business
4051992 i have lived here all my life and i know that many people are on tight budgets they especially the elderly need a supermarket in their neighborhood
4051993 these club stores put everybody out of business when they are no longer profitable they close leaving behind an empty building and a neighborhood in decay
4051994 as it is things are already tight with the high cost of electricity and rent
4051995 the bjs wholesale discount clubs anti union policies and the 45 membership fee it charges an astronomical figure for many residents of these areas are troublesome enough even worse is that as a matter of policy bjs stores do not accept food stamps or subsidies under the women infants and children wic program this makes it all but impossible for the community to benefit from their discounted prices
4051996 one of our issues with the warehouse club stores is also an issue with the mayor
4051997 the city did a study and determined that we need at least 100 supermarkets in the city not more bjs
4051998 according to the neighborhood retail alliance bjs stores gross more than a million dollars a week in sales and attract around 7 000 cars a day their impact on the existing supermarkets would be nothing short of devastating
4051999 most of them are minority owned independent key foods associateds pioneers and c towns they came into these neighborhoods in the 1970s when the national chains fled and helped bring back the local economies the bloomberg administration has taken an interest in promoting and preserving the citys supermarkets a worthy goal that the proliferation of discount club stores makes almost impossible to achieve
4052000 though mr bloomberg is no laissez faire diehard by any means the three projects the revitalization of coney island the redevelopment of the industry heavy willets point area by shea stadium and the creation of up to 5 000 units of mostly middle income housing at hunters point south by long island city seem to have far more city involvement and restrictions than those typical of the economic development agenda of the self described fiscally conservative mayor
4052001 we ve moved beyond the low hanging fruit and these involve i guess what i would call a more aggressive government position because these are really harder more involved projects

4052047 dude thats in play get the heck off the wall
4052048 id go id probably go like milan or something like that where i grew up or something like that peace out do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars because i grew up in italy it has more significance to me because im more familiar with it ive been there and i still have friends there im thinking about buying a house out there it would be nothing to me to be able to do that
4052049 if someone wants to throw 50 million on the table for me we can talk
4052050 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down i think right now its very exciting theyre starting a new buzz you start to do a little research and they got money over there you stay in the states you make the max you make 18 million take out taxes and you have 9 10 you have an opportunity to go somewhere and make 25 30 tax free we might have to pack our bags
4052051 it would definitely be something id consider you can never say never to anything the olympics have shown how this game has grown its not just the united states game anymore its the worlds game
4052052 as a businessman i would have to consider it if my wife was down and the money was right
4052053 from a business standpoint you have to at least listen to every offer
4052054 youre right only cska dynamo and khimki are the teams with huge money in europe along with olympiakos and panathinaikos from greece so if we are talking about lebron or kobe or any other superstar it all comes down to these five teams bc triumph formerly dynamo moscow region surprised everybody by signing krstic to a three million euro per year deal but its their only big buy so far and nobody knows what will happen next i think it is possible that one of these teams will find the money for an nba superstar yet 50 million is still outlandish were not talking about going roughly from 25 million team payroll to 32 million as was the case with childress but going from 25 million to 75 million it would make a little more sense if we were talking about what would be a 50 million a year nba contract which would equal about 17 million euros per year im sure that teams are preparing for talks and nobody is actually ready to just throw out 50 million now anyway its hard to predict anything because this will be an unprecedented move that will change the way we think now about sports contracts cska used to be the team paying crazy salaries compared to other teams in europe but for the last several seasons they have been coached by ettore messina and instead of chasing big names they try to get players that will fit the system this season when everyone is signing superstars the biggest names cska got are zoran planinic and erazem lorbek they are not the team that puts all their eggs in one basket messina is only signed until next summer though so well see what happens also cska has the most success in terms of public relations is well known everywhere in the world and they may be ready to spend to make the next step in these terms if youre nike youd want your player to be in moscow which is one of the world capitals playing for a well known team khimki have been big spenders for several years and this summer they went over the top the reason for that is they are hoping to get a contract with euroleague next summer when it could become a closed league it was announced that euroleague will look at marketability of the teams so khimki signed not just quality players but well known players from nba teams and successful national teams in carlos delfino and jorge garbajosa they went for the biggest names they thought they could target each player received what would be a 9 million a year nba contract the euroleague contract talks will continue next summer and if khimki are desperate to sign the deal they will have to spend crazy money actually if i were the euroleague i would quietly put pressure on the team and say you get lebron and well sign you to a euroleague contract on the other hand this is a smaller city in moscow region dynamo has a reputation of an underarchieving team here in russia they spend cska like money on their roster yet the results are very different this year they finally got a great coach in david blatt and also signed bostjan nachbar to what would be again a 9 million nba contract they are rumored to be targeting ben gordon now that its known that players of this caliber are available for the right money once again its impossible to tell how far the team can go in terms of spending because whats happening now is unprecedented for years dynamo has been the richest team that is not in the euroleague and they are desperate to get in the league still it is not surprising that it was a greek team which was the first to hand out a huge contract their owners have the most freedom to act because they are just that owners one person for each team russian teams have to find sponsors for each deal either from businesses or local governments which takes time and pursuasion sic if a greek owner feels like spending it will take him a second to give a go ahead to team management eccentric billionaire fan owners is not what russia is about
4052055 even more enticing to james has to be the revelation that earl boykins recently signed contract with italys virtus bologna includes income from bolognas sponsorship and marketing arms due to the nbas collective bargaining agreement this sort of arrangement is off limits in the nba but its exactly what lebron james inc is looking for james is right he wont become a billionaire by playing basketball so he and his management team have begun to look for more than endorsement dollars theyre now interested in equity stakes in the companies lebron lends his name to what if the owners of cska moscow or olympiacos the two teams reported to have contacted james offered him equity stakes in the teams and or outside business ventures they accumulated their billions in in addition to his playing salary an equity stake in a billion dollar business would pay dividends long after james called it quits on the hardwood and it would inch james closer to his stated goal of becoming the richest man in the world if the nbas collective bargaining agreement allowed it you can bet that james would negotiate an ownership percentage in the cavs or the soon to be brooklyn nets or the new york knicks any discussions between james and olympiacos or cska moscow will begin with what the euroleague can offer that the nba cannot
4052056 i wonder if the nba will be forced to adopt an mls style
4052057 european teams have rules that limit the number of non european teams that can be on their roster

4052068 we are always going to be a side thats going to be a little bit patchy because kids give you those inconsistencies
4052069 weve been very fortunate to have two or three very good senior players hold their consistency and im talking about shane wakelin and scott burns who are our oldest players
4052070 but then youve got jack anthony nathan brown john mccarthy chris dawes tyson goldsack sharrod wellingham
4052071 what are you going to get i want to have an enthusiastic group play good football but they are kids and they will be like that when youve got the inconsistency of youth you put up with it
4052072 its exciting its fantastic when you win i dont blame youth for losing but the inconsistency is sometimes a factor
4052073 you cant manufacture anything more than that finals are one of the greatest carrots in front of anyone and obviously collingwood have got it this week and for our guys its going to be motivationally very difficult
4052074 we did the right thing and the best thing for our club moving forward and thats as bad as it might seem the no 1 thing we have to consider the good and the life and the continuity of the club and you make decisions for long term rather than short term

4052104 denise says it is a declaration of war explosive stuff a national security issue
4052105 think it will be far more controversial than the satanic verses and the danish cartoons
4052106 i have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about islam and mohamed
4052107 i envisioned that my book would be a bridge builder
4052108 i wanted to honour aisha and all the wives of mohamed by giving voice to them remarkable women whose crucial roles in the shaping of islam have so often been ignored silenced by historians
4052109 the series of events that torpedoed this novel are a window into how quickly fear stunts intelligent discourse about the muslim world
4052110 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
4052111 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
4052112 to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
4052113 i wanted to honor aisha and all the wives of muhammad by giving voice to them remarkable women whose crucial roles in the shaping of islam have so often been ignored silenced by historians

4052117 the initial concept for prey b arf had been incubating for a while waiting for the right opportunity to come along
4052118 we jumped at the chance to create this game with a talented developer like human head studios wait i thought i was doing this on my own and next generation technology like the doom 3 engine game maker 7
4052119 prey is special for many reasons including several new and original gameplay features and a tightly integrated story that packs an emotional punch unlike other first person shooters
4052120 with their help prey is sure to breathe new life into the first person shooter genre with a compelling story innovative gameplay mechanics and dazzling imagery which is powered by our significantly enhanced version of id softwares original doom 3 engine
4052121 a significant number of your residents are not satisfied with how this has been handled
4052122 if mr campagna thinks there could be a conflict then 2 500 is a small price to pay to make sure everything is checked and balanced
4052123 as far as im concerned were not practicing fair bidding practices its not the american way
4052124 take it to court and we lose every single penny
4052125 i was in this small office with a desk a chair a typewriter and a telephone
4052126 and my job was a open a public library in 12 months
4052127 the goals we set 40 years ago have been met and the community still cares so much about the library and we are still busy what more can you ask for
4052128 i remember the first employees saying that at the time they wondered what if no one comes to the library and we end up with a big white elephant
4052129 said joan fancher who lives in ross and has worked at the library for 32 years
4052130 but it didnt take long to answer that question the people came and they have kept coming
4052131 deep down i knew it was going to make it it was going to succeed
4052132 if i thought it would fail i would not have taken the job the key to it was the community was completely behind us
4052133 im just extremely pleased and proud to have played a part in it
4052134 the creation of this library is the closest thing i could have done to giving birth to a baby to me this library was my baby
4052135 this place is my second home and these people are my second family
4052136 i told my children when they started out find a career you wouldnt mind doing 40 years from now and youll be happy im happy
4052137 she was never without a smile through thick and thin
4052138 she used to tell us not to worry because things would work themselves out no matter how bad they seemed at the time
4052139 i like to say mother led a pretty stress free life
4052140 she had two husbands who worshiped the ground she walked on and she was a wonderful christian woman
4052141 i cant ever remember her being sick a day in her life
4052142 in fact she took care of herself until she was 98 then she went to a home
4052143 she never weighed more than 120 pounds in her life
4052144 even after i made her quit driving she still would go to the womens meetings and always to sunday school because she enjoyed that
4052145 i just started driving her and made sure she got where she wanted to go
4052146 and she always saw that we were involved in that when we were children
4052147 for years she had a nice garden and in her younger years she canned a lot
4052148 the initial task will be to generate funds for a legal fund
4052149 in this type they essentially challenge the rationale of the creation of the overlay district and whether it was done for a legitimate purpose
4052150 my experience is that if there is a community group it generally carries more weight
4052151 if we go the distance we would need to generate 4 000 and this would require a tremendous effort and generosity on everybodys part
4052152 last week when i was training on the mountain three people had to be rescued by paramedics
4052153 this is an opportunity for us to show the true spirit of american people
4052154 the complaint he made is irrelevant he was fired for being a poor administrator
4052155 a very casual method of officers accounting for the their time
4052156 im also the lowest paid member of the department at 40 000 a year
4052157 there are about 650 000 acres in the county and half is forest and 128 000 acres are in farmland
4052158 thats a big piece of the county and who we are
4052159 westmoreland county is classified as urban and to still have a fair like we have is a unique opportunity
4052160 a lot of members are doing agriculture projects where its not necessary to live on a farm
4052161 the fair is one of the few places that agriculture has to show its products
4052162 it has always been an important part of the farmers lives
4052163 things like the tractor pulls that are a long tradition going back to the horse pulls are the epitome of the fair experience
4052164 one of the neat things is its multi generational involvement
4052165 it becomes a family tradition and is truly a community in its own right people come together to renew long lasting relationships when they come out to the fair
4052166 its like youre in paradise the music water food and drink camaraderie and beach like ambience
4052167 i love to boogie woogie to the old time music
4052168 its nice being outside and i love the festive atmosphere
4052169 i love watching other people dance it brings back memories of my carrick high school days
4052170 as a single parent i have to watch my finances i buy an annual pass and all this is included
4052171 its crucial that i spend the coming season without any injury

4052174 the annual rent of one symbolic euro cannot be considered in the circumstances as a disguised subsidy the constitutional principal of la cit which implies the neutrality of the state and collective territories and equal treatment for all religions does not in itself rule out the granting in the general interest of certain types of assistance for activities or equipment connected to religions

4052198 half of louisiana is under water and the other half is under indictment
4052199 over the course of many decades louisiana and new orleans have earned a reputation as being exceptionally tolerant of corruption
4052200 this fueled the demise of the local economy as it drove many companies away and kept them away
4052201 the assumption has been that if you want to do business here you need to set aside extra money to grease the wheels
4052202 we have some issues with corruption and bureaucracy but no more than any other urban environment
4052203 we have promised an end to corruption and incompetence in state government make no mistake about it this is a massive first step
4052204 this would rank louisiana among the top u s states for public disclosure rules and enforcement of those rules

4052216 china is developing quickly people enjoy more freedom and they have a lot to say if you ask the ordinary chinese on the street they will say the same
4052217 you have to believe the majority of the people otherwise you are misled
4052218 everybody can see that the olympic games are a great platform people are optimistic about their own future
4052219 i feel people come here to be critical that doesnt mean we are not fulfilling our promises
4052220 i say the games will open up the horizon about china

4052264 originally only 50 scholarship slots were made available for the entire davao city but due to the effort of speaker nograles the department of education added 500 more scholarship vouchers for students of the first district of davao
4052265 once a student qualifies under the program the financial assistance will be used to pay for his yearly tuition every school year until he finishes high school provided they do not receive any failing grades
4052266 the financial assistance will greatly help in the education of my children especially nowadays where everything is expensive

4052277 they made a presentation and we certainly appreciate that every effort has been made by the pakistan cricket board and the government to ensure the security plans are at the highest level
4052278 but the fact remains we still have concerns about threats particularly in light of the political situation in pakistan at the moment and the events of the last 12 24 hours
4052279 our biggest concern is the ability of the pakistan authorities to deliver the security plans and our concerns in those areas have not been eased following the visit of the taskforce
4052280 right from the word go weve had concerns about going and we dont think it was the right decision at this point in time to continue with the event in pakistan and nothing has changed there
4052281 it will be interesting to see what the icc delegation report back after their visits once theyve got pretty strong feedback from those four groups and see what the icc are going to do next week
4052282 the discussion weve had certainly hasnt changed the view of our players and our players were quite vocal in the meeting and i couldnt see how it would change the view of other players around the world either
4052283 while the champions league twenty20 is a domestic tournament not affected by icc event rules we have agreed to the icc request as a gesture of goodwill
4052284 we are happy that we were able to find a window during the first week of december for the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4052285 there was a gap in between the one day internationals and tests against the touring england squad and that will enable both the rajasthan royals and the chennai super kings to regroup and focus on the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20

4052288 i would like to go to amman to stand trial however what i fear is that i am convicted in advance
4052289 i made the cartoons to highlight that there are some terrorists who misuse islam and they take it as their spiritual ammunition i wanted to depict the terrorists as if they were taking the prophet mohammad as a hostage
4052290 i have no problem with islam but with the terrorists
4052291 i respect islam and its followers and i have nothing against it i have respect for other peoples religions however i will not apologise we have freedom of the press and religion in denmark
4052292 i am against the cartoons i am critical of them and they were a kind of anti muslim intended to humiliate and provoke muslims not only here in denmark but also abroad however i defend the freedom of press
4052293 we used them as a kind of documentation to show the public what we are talking about in the stories
4052294 i cannot apologise i respect islam and i did not target it
4052295 even though the internet sites of the danish media concerned are written in danish they are theoretically accessible to jordanians but i find it hard to believe that jordanian law applies or should apply in this case but that is for the lawyers to decide

4052308 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4052309 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4052310 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4052311 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4052312 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4052313 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4052314 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4052315 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4052316 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4052317 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4052318 who are open to doing something on the production side
4052319 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4052320 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4052321 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4052322 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4052323 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4052324 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4052325 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4052326 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4052327 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4052328 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4052329 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4052330 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4052331 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4052332 no penile mutilation in my threads the penis is an object of worship not sacrifice
4052333 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4052334 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4052336 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4052337 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4052338 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4052339 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4052340 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4052341 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4052342 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4052343 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4052344 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4052345 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4052346 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4052347 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4052348 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4052349 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4052350 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4052351 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

4052358 i cant believe it i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten
4052359 i didnt panic when i looked at the board i thought wow i did it
4052360 its so exciting its me and brontes last swim and what a great way to finish with a gold medal and a world record
4052361 for us to break the record by so far is amazing
4052362 we went in knowing we had a really good chance i wasnt as nervous this time i was trying to enjoy the moment ive never led off a relay before
4052363 i feel amazing i finished such a great meet as part of the relay its amazing there wasnt a lot of nerves just a lot of excitement im so impressed with everything that happened

4052371 there is no competition as far as sales go not in a tightrope fashion which you seem to see it
4052372 yes thats the only thing who can get to the highest first thats the only real competition who can do the best who can cater to more audience alright thats not what im saying last month mgs4 came out and it increased ps3 numbers severely but doesnt that by your theory mean those people who didnt buy the ps3 would have bought a 360 so therefore wouldnt the sales of the 360 go down
4052373 no a million people dont act like one person as example one might be appealed a more than b and he will get a but for that same exact reason a person across the globe will be appealed to b more than a and will buy b so did the person selling b or a lose a sale no because before that neither a or b would have been sold
4052374 so in practice when the littlebitplanet campaign sets in people who will look at the system and if it interests them buy the guy while the people who bought the wiis so far arent going to look at littlebigplanet and ask themselves whether they should get the wii or not theyll do it anyway

4052392 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4052400 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4052401 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4052402 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4052403 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4052404 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4052405 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4052406 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4052407 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4052408 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4052409 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4052410 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4052411 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4052412 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4052413 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4052414 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4052415 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4052416 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4052417 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4052418 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4052419 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4052420 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4052421 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4052422 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4052423 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4052424 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4052425 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4052426 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4052427 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4052428 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4052429 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4052430 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4052431 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4052432 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4052433 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4052434 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4052435 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4052436 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4052437 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4052438 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4052439 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4052440 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4052441 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4052442 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4052443 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4052444 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4052445 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4052446 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4052447 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4052448 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4052449 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4052450 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4052451 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4052452 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

4052458 alexander called me on tuesday and told me that magath called him in and told him about celtics interest
4052459 he said celtic wanted him and asked how he might feel about that alexander told him he was open to all possibilities but that scotland would not be his first choice
4052460 other big clubs are also interested but celtic are playing in the champions league the only concern for the player would be the scottish league
4052461 richard underwent an arthroscopic procedure to remove a loose piece of cartilage floating in his right shoulder
4052462 the early signs are excellent and the shoulder is settling well its too early to predict an exact date for when we can expect richard on the field but he will miss the start of the season

4052465 were glad georgia has had to withdraw its forces from iraq
4052466 russias ongoing action raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
4052467 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4052468 there is a very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
4052469 i listened to george bushs statement and was surprised the facts he cited are untrue
4052470 we have discovered an undefended georgian army depot containing a significant amount of military hardware and weapons near the town of gori the military hardware is in full working order and combat ready

4052475 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4052476 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4052477 the current market situation is such that we have to continually review and adjust our overhead to ensure that the business remains strong and well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities
4052478 this strategic cost cutting exercise will ensure a stable business model which will allow us to expand relatively rapidly when the market returns to normal
4052479 the intention going forward is to preserve as many jobs as possible to maintain the skills we will need in the future

4052482 funding is not something the central bank can supply it would be a very dangerous move to move to a situation where the government saw its major role as guarantee lending
4052483 why should the taxpayer take on the risk of borrowing by individual borrowers some of whom are risky
4052484 these results demonstrate british lands resilience in the face of a weak
4052485 while values are marked down in a thin market our prime assets buildings and customer contracts provide strength in difficult times
4052486 the underlying profit is pretty bleak clearly the value of its property portfolio has fallen
4052487 i was in this small office with a desk a chair a typewriter and a telephone
4052488 and my job was a open a public library in 12 months
4052489 the goals we set 40 years ago have been met and the community still cares so much about the library and we are still busy what more can you ask for
4052490 i remember the first employees saying that at the time they wondered what if no one comes to the library and we end up with a big white elephant
4052491 said joan fancher who lives in ross and has worked at the library for 32 years
4052492 but it didnt take long to answer that question the people came and they have kept coming
4052493 deep down i knew it was going to make it it was going to succeed
4052494 if i thought it would fail i would not have taken the job the key to it was the community was completely behind us
4052495 im just extremely pleased and proud to have played a part in it
4052496 the creation of this library is the closest thing i could have done to giving birth to a baby to me this library was my baby
4052497 this place is my second home and these people are my second family
4052498 i told my children when they started out find a career you wouldnt mind doing 40 years from now and youll be happy im happy
4052499 the complaint he made is irrelevant he was fired for being a poor administrator
4052500 a very casual method of officers accounting for the their time
4052501 im also the lowest paid member of the department at 40 000 a year
4052502 last week when i was training on the mountain three people had to be rescued by paramedics
4052503 this is an opportunity for us to show the true spirit of american people
4052504 the initial task will be to generate funds for a legal fund
4052505 in this type they essentially challenge the rationale of the creation of the overlay district and whether it was done for a legitimate purpose
4052506 my experience is that if there is a community group it generally carries more weight
4052507 if we go the distance we would need to generate 4 000 and this would require a tremendous effort and generosity on everybodys part
4052508 there are about 650 000 acres in the county and half is forest and 128 000 acres are in farmland
4052509 thats a big piece of the county and who we are
4052510 westmoreland county is classified as urban and to still have a fair like we have is a unique opportunity
4052511 a lot of members are doing agriculture projects where its not necessary to live on a farm
4052512 the fair is one of the few places that agriculture has to show its products
4052513 it has always been an important part of the farmers lives
4052514 things like the tractor pulls that are a long tradition going back to the horse pulls are the epitome of the fair experience
4052515 one of the neat things is its multi generational involvement
4052516 it becomes a family tradition and is truly a community in its own right people come together to renew long lasting relationships when they come out to the fair
4052517 she was never without a smile through thick and thin
4052518 she used to tell us not to worry because things would work themselves out no matter how bad they seemed at the time
4052519 i like to say mother led a pretty stress free life
4052520 she had two husbands who worshiped the ground she walked on and she was a wonderful christian woman
4052521 i cant ever remember her being sick a day in her life
4052522 in fact she took care of herself until she was 98 then she went to a home
4052523 she never weighed more than 120 pounds in her life
4052524 even after i made her quit driving she still would go to the womens meetings and always to sunday school because she enjoyed that
4052525 i just started driving her and made sure she got where she wanted to go
4052526 and she always saw that we were involved in that when we were children
4052527 for years she had a nice garden and in her younger years she canned a lot
4052528 its like youre in paradise the music water food and drink camaraderie and beach like ambience
4052529 i love to boogie woogie to the old time music
4052530 its nice being outside and i love the festive atmosphere

4052547 it was about three feet long a foot deep and a foot wide and it contained a quantity of very old bones the party was overwhelmed by emotion one workman fainted and remained blind for half an hour after he had recovered consciousness the clerk of the works was sent to tell the archbishop though the time was 2am and woke up the place by throwing stones at the coachmans window

4052556 om een kans te krijgen bij de gevestigde media moeten jonge tekenaars eerst naamsbekendheid verwerven en daarvoor is internet een zeer geschikt medium
4052557 wat het lastig maakt is dat de oudere tekenaars bij kranten en tijdschriften lang blijven zitten cru gezegd moeten jongere tekenaars wachten tot de oudere generatie doodgaat om een kans te krijgen
4052558 als je werk leuk of goed genoeg is dan maak je echt nog wel een kans bij geprinte media maar toch zal ik altijd online blijven publiceren
4052559 toen ik begon met het publiceren van mijn cartoons was er geen vraag naar vanuit de oude media ze pasten niet zo bij de linkse tijdgeest van toen daarom heb ik mijn eigen platform gecre erd
4052560 via internet kan ik mijn cartoons en idee n binnen enkele minuten publiceren het belang daarvan is direct tot mij doorgedrongen ook hoef ik niemand om toestemming te vragen voor ik iets plaats ik heb collegas bij kranten en tijdschriften die hun tekeningen aan redacties moeten voorleggen en er wordt soms in gerommeld ook kunnen zij hun cartoons vaak niet zomaar op hun eigen site plaatsen
4052561 toen bijvoorbeeld de pers verscheen zeiden ze dat ze een spraakmakende krant wilden maken maar ik vind de cartoons die erin staan toch erg braafjes volgens mij is dat uit angst voor de adverteerders ik krijg zelf natuurlijk ook wel eens negatieve reacties op internet maar dat heeft in ieder geval geen economische gevolgen
4052562 ik zie het internet als een oneindig tekenvel je kunt het plaatje zo groot of klein maken als je zelf wilt
4052563 het online publiek waardeert het enorm als een cartoonist moeite steekt in zijn eigen website dus moeten er geregeld cartoons verschijnen die nergens anders zijn geplaatst als ik een paar weken geen tijd heb om speciaal voor nozzman nl iets te produceren krijg ik het verwijt dat ik alleen maar cartoons doorplaats
4052564 ik ben er vanaf gestapt want er kwamen allemaal gekken op bezoek die van alles schreven dat niet te zake deed of die afspraken om elkaar ergens te treffen voor relletjes bijvoorbeeld ik had geen zin om de hele dag te modereren als mensen iets kwijt willen dan beginnen ze zelf maar een weblog
4052565 we have a scale 1 5 for lets say linebacker 6 3 may be a one 6 2 a two and you go right down the scale also you have a weight criteria that is on the same scale and then you have a speed criteria that is on the same scale
4052566 so if we had a 5 11 linebacker for example and the number one scale was 240 and the running speed was 4 6 and he was 5 11 240 4 6 he is a 5 1 1 which is 7 divided by 3 because he overcomes his size with great speed and has the weight he ends up being a guy that is a potential prospect as long as you go to the position criteria and he ranks very highly because he has to overcome a deficiency
4052567 what a lovely home i just love those window treatments

4052572 imagination humour melodies and chords twangy basslines of beauty they are a loveable band the kind of band whose songs you put on all mixtapes who you urge your friends to listen to

4052601 we had to go or there would have been shooting
4052602 to show to russia that we can come to the aid of a european ally and that we can do it at will whenever and wherever we want
4052603 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4052604 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4052605 we were unhappy with the initial actions of the american officials because they were perceived by the russians as green lines basically but this one was very strong
4052606 we wont be protecting the airport or seaport but well certainly protect our assets if we need to

4052625 i just purchased some sb900s and after a couple days shooting i thought you might like to know this the nikon sb900 does not fit many cold shoes like the justin clamp or crane cold shoe it does fit the really right stuff cold shoe perfectly and of course it fits the camera hot shoes after looking at it and trying on several shoes i thought it was because the body of the flash was lower to the flash shoe and most of the shoes it would not fit were plastic and had a thicker top lip than is on a camera hot shoe or the rrs cold shoe others on the web seem to think the shoe is bigger i dont think so or if it is it doesnt affect the fit in a nikon hot shoe so i took a crane cold shoe from b amp h for nikon flashes and sanded down the top and now the sb900 fits the shoe same for the justin clamp shoe i started with coarse sand paper then to medium then to very fine and it worked great if you do it just keep the shoe level i lay the sand paper on a flat surface and work with the shoe and only do enough to get the shoe to fit too much and you will weaken a plastic shoe be sure to finish with the very fine so the flash will slide on easy while i cant guarantee this is the only solution it worked for me im sure that bogen and other companies will modify their cold shoes to work in the future i have been working to get the word out about this because its a problem for lots of photographers
4052626 july attack may have been a dress rehearsal for an all out cyberwar once the shooting started between georgia and russia

4052633 socialism means social justice and equality but equality of rights of opportunities not of income
4052634 egalitarianism is in itself a form of exploitation exploitation of the good workers by those who are less productive and lazy
4052635 social justice and equality but equality of rights of opportunities not of income
4052636 this remarkable declaration represents an embrace of a postmodern version of socialism rather than moving cuba toward european democratic socialism a capitalist economy with a socialist social services system his prescription advocates what amounts to the worst of both worlds a state controlled economy in which the government shirks its social responsibilities

4052645 we are very emphatic with the context with which the issue advocacy of federalism is being made again it is in the context of the prospective signing and moving forward of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain and the realization of our peace agenda in mindanao we hope there is no other agenda that is being acknowledged or organized by malaca ang
4052646 outside of that we dont know any other agenda nor are we authorizing or recognizing any move to discuss or take any action towards constitutional amendments that consists of agenda other than what i said
4052647 they have also agreed that regardless of political affiliation and religion they are united for the peace process they also enjoined the government and the milf to conduct wider consultations with local government units and for both sides to exercise restraint and prudence in their future actions
4052648 crude has regained some of its losses over the past few trading sessions reacting to the inventory report which showed very substantial stock draws in gasoline

4052651 the criteria for mortgages may still be strict but its nonetheless encouraging to see mortgage rates coming down like this
4052652 essentially any move in this direction bodes well for the housing market implying a return of confidence among lenders which should translate into greater confidence among would be homeowners
4052653 with lenders determined to protect themselves against potential falls in house prices the biggest drops are aimed at those with the largest deposits
4052654 at the moment of course prices are dropping because of the problems in the mortgages market theyre dropping because so many people simply cant buy
4052655 any homeowner thinking of selling their property today faces an unpleasant choice sell now if they can for an average of 9 less than their property would have fetched at the peak of the housing market in october 2007 or wait and hope the market improves

4052676 to find fault that does not mean we are not fulfilling our promise
4052677 i did not say that china will promise to do whatever with the games coming to china i did not say that but i say the games will open up the horizon about china people will see better for themselves what china is like
4052678 so you are saying you agreed that china broke its promises
4052679 we are not going to shoot we are not going to kill
4052680 we came here simply to restore order and now it is secure here see i can drive around unarmed
4052681 the russians came first then the ossetians who shot at anyone they saw
4052682 the ossetians walk into homes take any valuables they want and then burn the rest
4052683 the russians are looting everything in sight the whole city is full of marauders
4052684 who in the world is going to help us nobody cares
4052685 there were only two or three cars of ossetians that came down i personally confiscated their assault rifles kicked them in their behinds and told them that i will have them executed if they come again
4052686 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4052687 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4052688 scud missiles can be purchased inexpensively for about 100 000 by anyone including private collectors in the worlds arms markets terrorists might buy steal or be given a no fingerprints nuclear weapon for example north korea has demonstrated willingness to sell both missiles and nuclear materials
4052689 known to have successfully test launched a scud missile from the caspian sea a launch mode that could be adapted to support an emp attack against the united states from the sea
4052690 the consequence of emp is that you destroy the communications network
4052691 and we are as you know and as the chinese also know heavily dependent on sophisticated communications satellite communications in the conduct of our forces and so whether its from an emp or its some kind of a coordinated anti satellite effort we could be in a very bad place if the chinese enhanced their capability in this area
4052692 saw ethnic georgian villages still burning from fires set by south ossetian militias witnessed looting by the militias and learned firsthand of the plight of ethnic ossetian villagers who had fled georgian soldiers during the georgian russian conflict over the breakaway region of south ossetia
4052693 we have had another 11 millimetres and it is still raining now
4052694 its not looking very promising but we will have the inspection and see where we are
4052695 richard underwent an arthroscopic procedure to remove a loose piece of cartilage floating in his right shoulder
4052696 the early signs are excellent and the shoulder is settling well its too early to predict an exact date for when we can expect richard on the field but he will miss the start of the season
4052697 christian played against kilmarnock the other night he is from germany and has experience of playing in the bundesliga
4052698 he has shown up quite well so far and we will se what happens
4052699 he was actually with us on trial before and has come back so we can have another look at him
4052700 alexander called me on tuesday and told me that magath called him in and told him about celtics interest
4052701 he said celtic wanted him and asked how he might feel about that alexander told him he was open to all possibilities but that scotland would not be his first choice
4052702 other big clubs are also interested but celtic are playing in the champions league the only concern for the player would be the scottish league
4052703 primaria sectorului 4 are specialisti care stiu sa ingrijeasca palmierii
4052704 they expressly authorize the fbi to engage in intelligence collection inside the united states
4052705 there was clear eyed and bipartisan recognition after the attacks that we needed to be able and allowed to collect intelligence in the united states
4052706 under the new guidelines the investigative steps that the fbi may take in a particular investigation will not be driven by irrelevant factors such as the type of paperwork the agent uses to open the investigation
4052707 im concerned with the way the attorney general frames the problem
4052708 he talks about arbitrary or irrelevant differences between criminal and national security investigations but these were corrections originally designed to prevent the type of overreach the fbi engaged in for years
4052709 nobodys complaining about the fbi collecting domestic intelligence when its appropriate and authorized under the law
4052710 what the attorney general is doing is expanding the bureaus intelligence collection without addressing the mismanagement within the fbi if you have an agency collecting more with less oversight its only going to get worse
4052711 the aai can create these two airports into models and compete with the private sector to develop world class airports they can even compete in the international arena
4052712 the expected employment generation under the new scheme would be 37 37 500
4052713 the pmegp improves upon the subsidy levels and the cost limits of projects compared to those available so far under the pmry
4052714 being seen next to isaf soldiers in uniform might make them more of a target
4052715 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
4052716 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4052717 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
4052718 the era of repression is over forever dictatorship has become a tale of the past
4052719 for political reconciliation general musharraf has to quit reconciliation is not possible without it
4052720 the war against extremism and terrorism is a war for our own survival
4052721 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
4052722 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
4052723 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
4052724 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
4052725 i dont know how political it was i had a high profile case
4052726 city asked whether wed be interested in selling santa cruz but were told very definitely the answer was no
4052727 theres no plans to sell him this summer particularly not to manchester city weve done all the selling we are going to do
4052728 we cant really go into the details of the owners position because if we are truthful we dont know which way it is going to go
4052729 but i was aware of this situation before i came here
4052730 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
4052731 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
4052732 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
4052733 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
4052734 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
4052735 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
4052736 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the united states deal on its own with some of the issues
4052737 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
4052738 she told him in no uncertain terms that he had to put a non use of force pledge on the table
4052739 we said be smart about this dont go in and dont fall for the russian provocation do not do this
4052740 has a responsibility to follow through its promise to halt the attacks and remove russian troops from the country
4052741 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
4052742 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
4052743 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
4052744 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4052745 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4052746 live up to the obligations it undertook just 24 hours ago
4052747 so that russia can begin to dig out of the hole that its gotten itself into
4052748 engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in south ossetia
4052749 and that is why russia is starting to face international condemnation for what it is doing
4052750 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4052751 we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4052752 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4052753 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4052754 will only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
4052755 we are not looking to nor do we need to take control of any air or sea ports to conduct this mission
4052756 you have heard the statement by the u s president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
4052757 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense ministry in order to conduct humanitarian and other missions this is a very important statement for easing tension

4052765 most prolific offerors of apparent child pornography in the comcast norths internet provider gallagher was able to use an internet protocol address assigned to north to find his home agents who preliminarily reviewed the hard drive found in norths home thursday believe some of the images both still and motion depicted a pre pubescent girl engaged in sexually explicit activities in north wasnt home during the search but gallagher went to his office in ibm providing information technology services to the department of homeland security
4052766 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
4052767 we are committed to upholding our obligations to remediate remove or upgrade them as necessary
4052768 we believe in adhering to any relevant environmental rule or law and will do so
4052769 we had a great luncheon fundraiser and i shook hands with a very enthusiastic supporter and it got me the wrong way
4052770 reserves the right to take whatever action it deems necessary
4052771 would give iran international legitimacy for its programme which it currently lacks
4052772 in an effort to see out the rest of bushs term in peace
4052773 we are truly looking forward to this partnership with century media i am encouraged that they indeed understand the spirit and integrity of loaded this first ep should shed some light on who we are what we do and how the fuck we do it
4052774 its probably more derivative of my earlier years of punk rock its a good rock n roll band its fun is what it is theres no real business and no real drama im really into no drama right now
4052775 i know and love the velvet revolver guys but there is no truth to the story about me joining their band
4052776 wow i would have never imagined that she was gonna be a mommy
4052777 i never would have thought that i would be where i am today
4052778 what about all the guys who go crazy over paris hilton lindsey lohan or tila tequilla
4052779 now if i talk it girl you know that i will walk it out
4052780 i havent heard anything about that and i havent had time to think about that issue for some days
4052781 are you asking me as a representative of elbit or of israel aerospace industries
4052782 we have two israeli cabinet ministers one deals with war defense minister david kezerashvili and the other with negotiations state minister for territorial integration temur yakobashvili and that is the israeli involvement here both war and peace are in the hands of israeli jews
4052783 we will fight to the death until the last russian soldier leaves georgian territory
4052784 if georgia falls all of the energy supply routes will be blocked
4052785 trying to take revenge on the united states but instead of attacking the sixth fleet he found himself an easier target
4052786 enabling us to train our army and giving us the possibility to withstand the russians
4052787 israel is betraying us along with the european countries and the united states
4052788 today there was a cossack pogrom against the local population as a jew that gives me a different feeling
4052789 israel did it at the russians behest it aided the terrorists the russians its a disgrace i dont know what it received in return i only see that hezbollah continues to get russian arms and plenty of it
4052790 there are many israeli businesspeople who invested money and a country should protect its citizens investments
4052791 they never believed georgia has such an army and that they would encounter such resistance
4052792 russia deployed 30 000 soldiers and a thousand tanks our people are not suicidal we dont want our soldiers to remain in the field and be killed by russian planes
4052793 the separatists fired at georgian villages we returned fire and asked the russians to order the ossetians to stop the russian representative told me we have to agree to a total cease fire and that president saakashvili had issued such an order to our army and we did not return fire even when they bombarded two of our villages i told the president we should pay the price just let there be peace but when we found out that they were continuing to transfer more weapons through the roki tunnel between russia and ossetia we had to attack it was a matter of screwing or being screwed
4052794 this plant is an example of how we are proactively pursuing two key aspects of gms global strategy
4052795 the first is the accelerated application of alternative fuels and propulsion systems to reduce global dependency on fossil fuels the second is growth in the emerging markets including the asean region as a key factor in our continued global leadership
4052796 diesel engines play a very important role in gms global advanced propulsion strategy we are leveraging expertise and resources within our company and through our technology partnerships to ensure we develop the worlds best engines this investment will also support manufacturing and grow advanced propulsion technology capability in thailand and across asia pacific
4052797 the new facility will be a state of the art highly flexible and people focused production complex that incorporates gms leading manufacturing strategies we are bringing the best gm has to offer to ensure that our customers receive the cleanest and most efficient diesel engine technology available add to this our work with cng cellulosic ethanol bio diesel and regular gasoline and it is clear that general motors is quickly becoming the energy diversity vehicle manufacturer in thailand
4052798 estamos pendientes de una reuni n que se celebrar la pr xima semana pero todo va seg n lo previsto
4052799 los n meros que he visto son los que esperaba
4052800 quedan por aclarar una serie de puntos y eso lo vamos a hacer la pr xima semana
4052801 cu nto voy a pagar no se lo puedo decir es un gran secreto pero ser mucho dinero aunque el mallorca lo vale
4052802 eso no es de mi competencia sino del presidente grande que es quien tiene potestad absoluta para decidir los movimientos que deben producirse dentro del equipo
4052803 todos los partidos me han encantado el mallorca tiene grandes jugadores y un gran entrenador con mi pol tica ambiciosa estaremos en condiciones de luchar por lo m ximo esta pr xima temporada en la liga espa ola estoy muy satisfecho
4052804 primero debo tener esta segunda reuni n con mis abogados y luego ya entraremos en la recta final de la operaci n
4052805 estamos en negociaciones pero a n no puedo decir quien es porque no est cerrada su contrataci n s lo puedo adelantar que es un importante personaje en inglaterra que tiene mucha experiencia en la premier league y que en su campo es el n mero uno
4052806 they were ambushed and murdered at 10 30 in the morning by numerous armed gunmen and it was very very fast
4052807 they were absolutely committed passionate caring and highly effective workers and they were purely on a humanitarian mission
4052808 people only travel in broad daylight in small groups we equip them with extensive communication radio equipment so they can call ahead
4052809 es posible configurar el env o para que se haga cada cierto tiempo o que no se realice a los dispositivos que ya tengamos emparejados el resultado de las operaciones de env o aparece en una columna situada junto al nombre de los m viles detectados
4052810 truth or consequence say it aloud use that evidence race it around
4052811 in the last round i knew i wouldnt get the decision unless i knocked him out
4052812 the scoring here is so bad for an olympic games its unbelievable
4052813 i felt my performance was exceptional but ive had better days i felt i should have had six or seven points for my body shots but theyre not scoring body shots
4052814 i hope to have heard the national anthem once before i leave each night
4052815 the olympic champion does have to prove that he is clean
4052816 there hasnt been such hype about the 100m in a long time the people have seen things they have never seen before people say you cant run that fast to have three 9 7 runners is amazing
4052817 given the market environment we remain alert to changes in customer sentiment
4052818 but our first half performance gives us increased confidence that 2008 pro forma revenue growth will be closer to 4 percent compared to our previous guidance of around 3 percent
4052819 from all over the darkened house childish laughter broke forth continuously
4052820 a smaller muzzle and much larger cranium finally created the new design
4052821 with a huge head dwarfing its trunk and a pair of oversized eyes with pupils and lashes disneys bambi arouses sympathy and nurturance and a sense of parenthood
4052822 it taught him about i guess on a broad scale sexuality
4052823 i was in love with thumpers girlfriend from the time i was seven until i was ten shes got all that eye shadow on and shes looking real good
4052824 the trouble with wilderness or getting back to the wrong nature
4052825 yesterday was the past tomorrow is the future and today is the present for that is what it is a present a gift
4052826 we are always going to be a side thats going to be a little bit patchy because kids give you those inconsistencies
4052827 weve been very fortunate to have two or three very good senior players hold their consistency and im talking about shane wakelin and scott burns who are our oldest players
4052828 but then youve got jack anthony nathan brown john mccarthy chris dawes tyson goldsack sharrod wellingham
4052829 what are you going to get i want to have an enthusiastic group play good football but they are kids and they will be like that when youve got the inconsistency of youth you put up with it
4052830 its exciting its fantastic when you win i dont blame youth for losing but the inconsistency is sometimes a factor
4052831 you cant manufacture anything more than that finals are one of the greatest carrots in front of anyone and obviously collingwood have got it this week and for our guys its going to be motivationally very difficult
4052832 we did the right thing and the best thing for our club moving forward and thats as bad as it might seem the no 1 thing we have to consider the good and the life and the continuity of the club and you make decisions for long term rather than short term
4052833 the united states took a series of steps that emboldened georgia sending advisers to build up the georgian military including an exercise last month with more than 1 000 american troops pressing hard to bring georgia into the nato orbit
4052834 it is curious but not surprising how the bush administration and its allies have now found renewed respect for international law in the caucasus but not when it comes to 1 the united states invading afghanistan and iraq while threatening to attack iran 2 israel invading lebanon and palestine attacking syria and threatening to attack iran 3 ethiopia invading somalia 4 colombia attacking ecuador etc from an international law perspective the real issue here is whether during her trip to tbilisi a month ago u s secretary of state rice gave the proverbial green light to georgia to attack south ossetia and thus deliberately provoke an overreaction by russia and how does this fit in with the u s u k naval armada currently steaming for the persian gulf and possible military confrontation with iran over its right to engage in nuclear enrichment under the nuclear non proliferation treaty
4052835 the costs of war international law the un and world order after iraq
4052836 i am above all astounded by the mainstream medias failure to take proper note of the pipleline geopolitics that infuses the russian moves with their global significance
4052837 although native flavours are starting to appear in chutneys sauces and spice blends in coles and woolies you wont find crocodile meat in the cold cabinet let alone fresh warrigal greens or kakadu plums alongside the salad mix and packham pears
4052838 research shows that we gravitate to flavours that taste the most familiar with such conservative palates australians are not going to rapidly embrace challenging new native flavours
4052839 native foods tick all the boxes of these emerging consumer trends
4052840 csiro is discovering that some native foods have high levels of antioxidants building on the 1980s research that found kakadu plums have the highest fruit source of vitamin c in the world
4052841 native foods are also tapping into an emerging groundswell of more adventurous eating in australia and in the future saltbush lamb lemon myrtle pasta and wattle seed ice cream might become as aussie as meat pies lamingtons and vegemite
4052842 it is just right that dr pettett will take on this task
4052843 he is very able internationally traveled and loyal to our university
4052844 the dimond program is very important in providing students and faculty members the opportunity to experience and gain an understanding of the medical issues and challenges unique to other countries
4052845 under dr pettetts leadership we are confident that the program will continue to thrive and expand its mission
4052846 this allows tenants to have complete certainty about their future and work with the confidence that all their endeavours will not be rewarded by a significant upwards rent review
4052847 if good people have increased their business why should the brewery suddenly be entitled to take a bigger share
4052848 any normal business partnership has two partners who work closely together and have ultimate trust in each other
4052849 however the perception of many tenancy agreements is that one partner seems to consider the other as dishonest and the other partner seems to consider the other as a policeman how can this result in the two partners optimising the business
4052850 customers must not smoke on the street outside these premises any person failing to observe this condition will be refused further service at the bar upon re entry
4052851 i thought something would happen to the premises licence or i would be removed as dps thats the pressure i was under
4052852 unreasonable but its the kind of condition that can be imposed at a review
4052853 we deplore these proposed price increases were being hit from all sides
4052854 we understand ofwat is receptive to external lobbying and will be writing to them to make a plea on behalf of our members and all of the thousands of smaller operators in the trade for small businesses to be given some relief against these price hikes
4052855 perhaps a sliding scale of increases based on usage or square footage could be introduced to stop small businesses being hit so hard
4052856 veronica is a great starter and she has gotten better

4052860 but it does not resolve the dispute indeed we would hope everyone acknowledges that it is impermissible under the constitution for a court to order someone not to repeat publicly available truthful information
4052861 the restraining order even if modified remains an improper prior restraint restricting speech
4052862 the first amendment does not allow people to be silenced because their speech exposes flaws even if those flaws might someday be illegally misused by others to protect our clients rights we had no choice but to ask the court to reconsider the gag order
4052863 the students ultimate goal in the security research was to help the mbta improve its security
4052864 despite colorful marketing rhetoric advertising a presentation of the students work at a security conference the students never intended to provide sufficient information to the public to replicate the attack
4052865 the olympic games have always had a significant long run impact on the host countrys inbound tourism the massive media exposure for the beijing olympics will offer china a chance for its tourism industry to use its cultural and historical legacy to attract people who would not normally come to china
4052866 chinas inbound tourism revenue will maintain its steady growth on the condition that chinas gross domestic product gdp keeps growing its consumer price index cpi remains relatively stable and the exchange rate changes of the chinese rmb are made gradually
4052867 chinas achievements and economic successes can only support the tourism industry in the short run aggressive marketing strategies are required in order for the industry to sustain the pressures of global competition in the long term
4052868 these ice cores reveal that west antarcticas climate is influenced by atmospheric and oceanic changes thousands of miles to the north
4052869 these results help put antarcticas recent climate trends into a global context
4052870 these results are the first to demonstrate that we can unambiguously detect that influence in ice core records
4052871 unfortunately this sector has experienced some difficulties a spokesman told the sunday telegraph
4052872 while it is clear the sector has gone through a year that has had a major impact on businesses there has been no radical review of the leisure sector
4052873 its business as usual we look after businesses in tough times as well as the good times
4052874 we understand the need for careful assessment of business risk but if the banks had not been so profligate with sub prime insurance we wouldnt be in this current mess

4052876 er zijn zo weinig vrouwen die een technologiebedrijf leiden dat bij een vertrek onmiddellijk gewezen wordt op een gebrek aan vrouwelijk leiderschap in de sector
4052877 maar nog bemoedigender is de opkomst van talloze jonge vrouwelijke professionals die hun weg naar de top aan het maken zijn
4052878 van het overgrote gedeelte daarvan heeft men nog nooit gehoord maar ze zijn er wel zoals tina sharkey johnson amp johnson caterina fake flickr en mena trott six apart gina bianchini ning en zelfs marissa mayer onderdirecteur search products amp user exeperience bij google

4052892 die zentrale intramuslimische unterscheidungslinie verl uft nicht prim r zwischen mehrheit der muslime und minderheit islamistischer extremisten sondern zwischen subjektiv berzeugten streng gl ubigen muslimen konservativer bis fundamentalistischer couleur einerseits und innerlich glaubens und weltanschauungsdistanzierten zwangsmuslimen was den streng gl ubigen teil der muslime betrifft so zeigt sich tats chlich dass die abgrenzung zwischen islam und islamismus orthodoxie und extremismus nicht nur schwierig und willk rlich ist sondern im grunde realit tswidrigem westlichen wunschdenken entspringt
4052893 spontan emotionale berreaktion von leuten die den erfahrenen islamistischen ha gegen ungl ubige in rage versetzt und die sich durch die ausbreitung einer antiliberalen gegengesellschaft mit vermummungsgeboten zwangsverheiratungen und aggressiven sittenw chtern herausgefordert f hlen

4052911 well be looking at the effects of the earthquake on the ground and for evidence of what actually happened during the earthquake well be looking very closely at how the tectonic blocks actually moved in relation to each other
4052912 much of what actually happens during earthquakes is difficult to view because it occurs deep below the surface by looking at the way in which roads pipelines rivers and other man made markers are affected we can map out how the earth moved what faults were responsible and what kind of activity we might expect in future events
4052913 aftershocks are expected after every large earthquake and this has been no exception earthquakes release stress where they occur but they also cause increased stress in the surrounding rock and this additional pressure has to be released peak aftershock activity is generally in the first few days after the main quake and the number and size of aftershocks decreases rapidly after that

4052920 some coaches get into the nhl early and they dont have the chance to develop what their philosophies styles and beliefs are
4052921 that to me is a benefit that i think is going to help
4052922 its a great opportunity because you can mold the players into what you believe and how you believe they should play
4052923 i look at last years team the team didnt make the playoffs there was a lot of youth a huge goals for goals against differential
4052924 theres been this common denominator of a tight defensive style of play
4052925 as tight as our defensive style will be a lot of that stems from the fact that were going to do a lot of good defensive play by playing good offensively and establishing our forechecking
4052926 i want our team to make the other team be pressured into situations where they dont want to play with the puck theyll want to get rid of it

4052946 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir

4052960 i did say that the olympic games will help china open up and reform better
4052961 china is developing quickly people enjoy more freedom and they have a lot to say if you ask the ordinary chinese on the street they will say the same
4052962 you have to believe the majority of the people otherwise you are misled
4052963 everybody can see that the olympic games are a great platform people are optimistic about their own future

4052970 what i wanted to do is show my best performance here in beijing
4052971 im glad that i won this race i was going to improve my time a bit more but to win this race is more important than to set a good time
4052972 i didnt feel pressure before the competition i tried to relax
4052973 and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about others my coach said to me that we will have two chinese swimmers in the final so you dont need to force yourself to win gold you just need to try your best
4052974 the pressure was much less we swam together and i felt like we were in training

4052998 what a pity i havent got mike to run to now
4052999 i dont think we should ever take that for granted because events come along but there has been a catastrophic loss of trust in gordon browns government
4053000 i think he will find it very difficult to rebuild that trust but we are under no illusion that the public becoming disillusioned with the government doesnt automatically mean that they will embrace the opposition we have to work to gain their trust and that is what we are doing now
4053001 we have proposed measures on fuel duty on vehicle excise duty changes on stamp duty for first time buyers and ideas on reforming corporate insolvency law to make it easier for businesses to stay afloat when they are hit by the credit crunch to preserve jobs
4053002 gordon brown has for a long time boasted that one of britains great strengths was low inflation but we now see british inflation significantly higher than eurozone inflation
4053003 one of the reasons for that is clearly down to a government policy failure
4053004 because the markets are no longer satisfied with the state of our economy and in particular the state of the public finances sterling is taking a hammering on the currency markets and as sterling slides the cost of everything increase disproportionately and so we are taking a double hit from the international rise in energy prices and the weakness of sterling
4053005 it is just another sign of the chaos and confusion that is gripping the government when they used to be quite good at managing the news agenda
4053006 the issue of stamp duty was spun quite shamelessly to cover the bad news story of northern rock and the taxpayer having to write off 3bn of investment into the bank
4053007 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
4053008 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
4053009 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
4053010 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else

4053017 people will be shocked to see that there are areas of the country where fewer than one in eight children sit a levels as ever it is the poorest areas that are worst affected
4053018 it is a scandal that in some of the most deprived parts of the country there are more children under 18 not in education employment or training than there are studying for top academic qualifications
4053019 this back of a fag packet maths adds nothing to the picture on a levels and completely ignores the fact that many youngsters travel between boroughs to do their a levels do other qualifications or work based training or apprenticeships
4053020 for example according to these flawed figures kensington and chelsea apparently has 193 per cent of their pupils studying a levels

4053023 labour is increasing investment in nhs dentistry so that patients now pay a lower proportion of the total cost of dental treatment than they did under the tories
4053024 patient charges have stayed the same in real terms as they have gone up in line with inflation

4053049 it is what chelsea and peter kenyon want but there is no way they will pay what madrid want
4053050 the money madrid are asking for is exaggerated in todays market
4053051 a key issue over buying robinho has always been that real are looking for a replacement

4053103 tampaknya renang mendapat keuntungan dari banyaknya cerita menarik mengenai prestasi sejumlah atletnya tahun ini termasuk upaya michael phelps berburu medali emas kembalinya dara torres dan park tae hwan yang menyabet medali emas pertama kalinya bagi korea selatan
4053104 its competitive its social its something i look forward to every summer
4053105 this is our opportunity to let the community know were looking to expand
4053106 and open to new members and lots of new activities
4053107 once you get out on the water its a competition
4053108 and with this fleet growing as it is its getting more and more competitive we have 15 boats out here now so were not only fighting for 1st and 2nd places its 5th 6th and 7th
4053109 i really appreciate the people that i sail with theres a lot of good friends to be made down here
4053110 the chinese team is responsible for a lot of peoples dreams
4053111 this year has not been very good for china theres been a lot of disasters so these olympic games theres a lot of pressure its impossible not to be nervous and its how to cope with the nerves is our job and right now i feel very excited
4053112 after the athens games i wanted to retire from the national team because i thought i was in very good shape back then if i couldnt win a gold medal then i thought i could never get a gold
4053113 extra training would not have had an effect i was worried that even if i could have adjusted myself to the best standards in 2008 i could not get a gold
4053114 but my coach huang yubin kept on encouraging me he took me on a vacation and told me that the 2008 games would be the greatest chance in 100 years and i should have a try at it he kept pushing me and then he kicked me to the highest position on the podium
4053115 i thought a month ago if i would get this medal i would be every emotional
4053116 but im really not because we won the team gold medal
4053117 he must be the most consistent gymnast and to do it in front of the home crowd with all that pressure thats just a great performance
4053118 actually i did not do any research in regards to the previous medals for france it was not part of my preparations i came to be a part of the final six on pommel horse that was the goal and that was my expectation
4053119 this medal it was so unexpected and i probably will not realize the significance of it until later
4053120 i definitely didnt have that fired up feeling that i had with the team but im really happy with how i did
4053121 the ones who are playing are in the water and theyre going to do a good job for sure im going to prepare the team the next couple of days for the game against greece but execution is coming from the players in the water
4053122 when i was doing a little more than i was supposed to they said ok you cant stay here youve got to go its ridiculous but whatever
4053123 thats something i cant stand im not going to just close my eyes to that
4053124 the quest to have more medals than spitz will be something very important
4053125 and hes keeping the attention of the public he is a great athlete
4053126 you had jesse owens you had paavo nurmi carl lewis and now you have phelps and thats what we need to have
4053127 last year was tough on the field and also off the field im a stronger man especially with accepting and dealing with the passing of my mom
4053128 it was a tough year man a very tough year
4053129 i think its going to exploit the versatility he has and the things hes able to do
4053130 running the ball trick plays mismatch opportunities he has a great opportunity in this offense to do a lot of the things marshall faulk did for a lot of years
4053131 when coach martz came in he told me the more i understand what hes trying to do the more ill like it
4053132 i see it i see it its going to be fun this year
4053133 im going to get really strong and itll be a different sasha
4053134 because im going to shoot for that all around medal as well as that gold team medal
4053135 i dont have much to lose now we won the medal that was important and im just going to keep swinging big
4053136 if he would have stuck the landings the way he did in team finals hed have been in the medals
4053137 we were watching yang wei and we were already talking about things he needs to do over the next four years
4053138 if i hit that routine and stick the dismount i could definitely be on top of that medals podium
4053139 what a better way to leave the olympics than that but im going to have to hit
4053140 the ones who are playing are in the water and theyre going to do a good job for sure im going to prepare the team the next couple of days for the game against greece but execution is coming from the players in the water
4053141 when i was doing a little more than i was supposed to they said ok you cant stay here youve got to go its ridiculous but whatever
4053142 thats something i cant stand im not going to just close my eyes to that
4053143 when i come back this time its all about business
4053144 ive waited four years for a rematch im not taking it lightly
4053145 veronica campbell is an amazing competitor we have a really great rivalry
4053146 this race is going to be more exciting than they have been she will be rested more weve been waiting for this for a long time
4053147 she has been running fantastic all year its going to be a really great final
4053148 i definitely think i am everything in practice points to that
4053149 i just have a couple of fine tuning things in the next few days and i will be ready to go
4053150 im definitely not disappointed at all at running the 100 it definitely helped my 200 for the first 100 of my race
4053151 im exactly where i need to be with my training in the end it will definitely pay off
4053152 i did run poorly it was just a bit of exhaustion my legs were dead
4053153 now im hitting my times in practice and im exactly where i need to be im confident
4053154 si no hubieran conflictos las fuentes de energ a ser an m s baratas
4053155 pero bueno es que no tienen otra hora a la que venir
4053156 if you cannot stop them it doesnt matter if i know so much
4053157 its going to be a very very tough game china is the host and they play very well
4053158 you have to go play and play well even if you know how they play
4053159 the next match against the united states is very important for us
4053160 our major task now is to calm down and focus on it
4053161 i think we are very much under pressure for this game we need to focus on ourselves
4053162 china plays fast they play a lot of combinations how much we can play under the pressure and play well thats more important
4053163 que me llamar an a mi tel fono a las 15 00 horas para darle m s datos ah empez la tragedia

4053167 a l lo asesinan de una forma brutal y es cuando decidimos acudir a la polic a antes no lo hab amos hecho porque cuando nos dijeron que era personal de la afi agencia federal de investigaci n lo menos que quieres es ir con ellos
4053168 desde el primer momento se llam a los negociadores yo ten a una relaci n con esa empresa de seguridad porque se hab a encargado de estudiar y contratar a los escoltas as como de tomar las medidas de seguridad de la empresa por eso en cuanto supe del secuestro les llam para chambear en esto
4053169 no puedes entregar lo que piden porque si no solicitan m s por tanto hay que armarte de paciencia para tener pronto a tu hijo de regreso
4053170 dijeron que en dos horas lo dejar an en un centro comercial estuvimos hasta las 5 esperando pensando ah viene y no pas nada a cada momento esperamos que regresara pasaron los d as y ten amos esperanza de que pedir an un segundo pago o que lo soltaran
4053171 el momento nunca lleg pero nunca me imagin que ya hab a sido brutalmente asesinado lo o mos una vez y varias veces supimos que estaba vivo por pruebas de vida preguntas que s lo l sabe y contesta no tuvimos la menor duda de que al hacer el pago l estaba vivo
4053172 no s qu complicaciones tuvieron entre ellos si se robaron uno a otro hasta que tomaron decisi n

4053190 son los mejores jugadores que escog pienso que siempre ser lo bonito del futbol que todos tienen su opini n pienso que eso es bonito pero tambi n pienso que lo importante es convocar a lo justo y siento es justa la convocatoria

4053192 tengo tenemos con el cuerpo t cnico una idea para presentar la mejor formaci n para el mi rcoles pero esta vez va a ser clave porque nunca trabaj con este grupo
4053193 pensamos que estos jugadores son para el evento los mejores es bonito esto porque cada quien tiene su opini n y cada quien habla de lo justo es bonito coincidir pero en el futbol se habla de lo justo y lo injusto pienso que en este caso es lo justo

4053216 its usually two weeks to break the story for a lost episode
4053217 i was thrilled with the twelve nominations that our show got
4053218 two questions one whats your opinion on the philosopher jeremy bentham and b was he chosen because of the panopticon prison where an entire society is being watched but they dont know it
4053219 we tried to push the envelope with a few things and we get very little pushback
4053220 i like to try to write kind of right below the comprehension line and hope that production pushes us over that line
4053221 i always think of casting as like when you cant find your car keys its panic panic panic panic oh there it is
4053222 we can also say that were not ever going to do a paradox on the show
4053223 its not so much an obsession with death as it is an obsession with life because death is just the punctuation to everything that comes before
4053224 if youve seen a flash forward that event is immutable its not changeable
4053225 the greatest thing that could ever be uttered in the halls of the networks is we have too many shows about time travel i think that would be a huge achievement
4053226 we were very excited about creating a fairytale aesthetic on primetime television
4053227 so we always try to shoot it 16 9 and protect for 4 3
4053228 once i started watching it in march i couldnt watch anything else
4053229 to tell you the truth up until the end of the third season it was a little bit of both
4053230 we still come into the writers room every episode and break the story and theres an organic process that goes along

4053240 in contrast to hitlers bizarre belief that the core of judaism is
4053241 woher nehmen wir das recht zu glauben der mensch sei nicht von uranfaengen das gewesen was er heute ist der blick in die natur zeigt uns dass im bereich der pflanzen und tiere veraenderungen und weiterbildungen vorkommen aber nirgends zeigt sich innherhalb einer gattung eine entwicklung von der weite des sprungs den der mensch gemacht haben muesste sollte er sich aus einem affenartigen zustand zu dem was er ist fortgebildet haben
4053242 from where do we get the right to believe that man was not from his very origin what he is today glancing at nature we see that in the plant and animal kingdoms changes and developments happen but nowhere in that do we see a leap a development of the magnitude man must have made if he has as surmised advanced from an ape like state to what he is

4053257 but its a phone and thats what i needed it to be first
4053258 people use the iphone as a pc in their pocket
4053259 apple should change the name to itablet its slightly mispositioned
4053260 its acceptable for enterprise use if the security it provides is the same as other handsets in play
4053261 theres much more granularity with these apps as the e mail is richer and it now permits background processing
4053262 neither wants to go there as its too much work and not enough payoff
4053263 apple will make its millions in the consumer space while rim will make its money in the enterprise
4053264 by use of our development models we have literally covered the canvas in terms of offering direct type in and premium domain names for dubai and the regions further extending this dynamic market on a global level and enhancing the clarity and transparency of this exciting development to a world audience
4053265 we will literally show you how you cannot afford not to be in the business of dubai in terms of properly representing your business to the world thru the internet dubai has already achieved the unimaginable our company will offer you the vehicle to take the unimaginable to new heights with no ceiling in sight
4053266 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day

4053269 i asked you two times already you said this bus goes to woosung apartments
4053270 when you said woosung apartments i thought you meant the one in bundang how was i supposed to know you meant kangnam
4053271 how was i supposed to know im not familiar with this bus system
4053272 how long would it take for me to get back to kangnam
4053273 no one has a bigger embedded user base than office
4053274 what we see happening is companies like webex connect salesforce com microsoft and google are trying to fence in their little area of the cloud
4053275 you sign into salesforce com in the morning and stay there all day
4053276 we completed this acquisition because were beginning to get some significant business on the back of the ibm and dell relationship
4053277 theres a bit of detail to be worked out in terms of what of the existing pingtel business models we will continue to support
4053278 the open source software based approach is very easy to deploy manage and integrate and is something proven to work in the smb space
4053279 it seems that nortel understands the market demands for more open source less proprietary systems
4053280 my thought was microsoft and nortel would be building this stuff together
4053281 if you are unhappy about my buying those domain names then im afraid its a case of tough luck
4053282 you should have had the foresight to buy them yourselves if you wanted them
4053283 ive done nothing legally or indeed morally wrong and you can gripe all day until the cows come home about it for all i care
4053284 i dont mind the imagery of our state parliamentary leaders being up there but i do object to information being up there that is patently false
4053285 we do try and buy as many of the domain names with different suffixes that we can but its also a practical thing at the end of the day where do we stop
4053286 but the quickest easiest thing would be to reach some sort of agreement and that may involve giving him a few dollars if thats the path of least resistance
4053287 the best form of defence really us to be proactive and make sure you register all domain names well in advance
4053288 there is no steve jobs in this country he has the power to unite the marketing and technology and business groups unfortunately japanese companies arent structured that way
4053289 they japans mobile industry have been coddled in this market the iphone could be the trigger that forces them to make changes
4053290 i feel sorry for albie id hate to be poor
4053291 im not poor i got 1500 in the bank and im on big brother you know
4053292 its a way to lock up the content and its not enabling as much innovation as we would like to see
4053293 the idea that you can model the job you want and actually do much of it before you seek a job this border between school and work will get fuzzier and fuzzier
4053294 currently i dont see this expanding to the average cell phone yet however we dont really know what technology will spread until it does
4053295 they developers would build their application on our media processing unit which is called a voice engine and what we do is make sure it integrates optimally with the iphone
4053296 we provide the voice engine to application developers so they can concentrate on their core business and know theyve got the highest quality voip using our voice engine which works very well especially under strained conditions on the network making it perfect for a wifi network
4053297 what i can tell you is that were well known for doing the voice side of things and also video so its definitely on our roadmap
4053298 it says you can only download for use on a single pc or a single network
4053299 it seems a little pointless when the welsh language board has already paid to have it done and has a mission to disseminate it as widely as possible
4053300 im not bothered if i play left right in the middle i love playing football
4053301 liverpool have a good team and want to win something this year
4053302 but were at home its the first game and we need a positive result
4053303 we hear a lot about stalins terror and the monstrosities of nazism but scarcely a word on the british and western empires or the horrors they perpetrated
4053304 this is not a story of simple plumbing but a symptom of a determination to enforce western global hegemony
4053305 i have always loved computers i find them really interesting and stimulating ive been into it since the age of two when my grandfather bought me my first computer and at the moment i am in the process of setting up an online blog for my family
4053306 i hope to be a web designer when i finish my education when i am not on my pc or my laptop i spend lots of time reading i also enjoy rock music and play the electric guitar
4053307 i think the exam went very well the extra studying is tough but i enjoy it a lot
4053308 we are delighted with his result we have always told him it is not about the result it is about doing your best and he absolutely did
4053309 school isnt always challenging enough for him we thought he should take a break after the gcse but he couldnt wait to get back in to it and start studying for the as level
4053310 to achieve any higher than a c he would have to have been chained to a desk and that is not what it is about it is meant to be fun and he really enjoys it
4053311 we encourage the children to play outdoors or read we dont have any computer consoles in the house we are fairly strict about that
4053312 baietii privesc cu mare incredere atit meciul de cupa cit si returul de campionat
4053313 there will be more out there thats just the ones that are being reported to us
4053314 last year we started getting more reports so two years in a row now weve had unusually large numbers of man of wars reported
4053315 were expecting more to wash up as long as the wind prevails they will keep coming
4053316 jade wasnt sure when she was first approached because she was worried about how the indian housemates and public might react
4053317 she was really upset about everything that happened after the scandal last year people in india were burning effigies of her in the street
4053318 but she really wants to clear her name and prove to everyone shes not a racist
4053319 during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
4053320 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4053321 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin

4053323 es ist ein schwieriger stoff und so etwas wollen wir schauspieler haben
4053324 meine karriere l uft gut ich habe viele angebote f r rollen die nichts mit sch nheit zu tun haben
4053325 es ist einfach ein geniales konzept das perfekt in unsere zeit passt
4053326 me and my homey q are about to do it big with ske and thats real rap
4053327 when my older boys played i thought man this doesnt look safe out here so i got to do a little work on the diamonds
4053328 so i guess i have been doing it for about 20 years
4053329 the reason i do it is that i played on so many cow pastures and poor diamonds it wasnt safe and i am looking at these 20 years ago and there are big holes around the pitching mound and there are big holes around the bases and at home plate i thought boy that is just an accident waiting to happen i thought if i can make it safer for just one person to avoid a jammed thumb or a twisted ankle then i feel my job is a success even if it is just one guy
4053330 i love the game or i wouldnt be out here i want it to be safe too but i love the game that much and i can take a lot of heat but i cant take that much humidity i take a drink once in a while and keep puttering away and when the guys get here for practice hey it is ready for them that gives me satisfaction knowing it is safe for them
4053331 i took a guess and figured out that i spend about 10 hours a week out at mitchell field
4053332 nolan my son comes up here and he is my best ally he sometimes rides up here three times a day on game days just to baby sit the pitching mound he probably comes out here about five hours a week
4053333 it is funny that you should ask that as far as canadian baseball rules go i havent quite got it to where i want it yet so i cant quit until i get it there it is a point of pride of mine to get it better than it was and i am striving to those standards but i havent got it yet
4053334 when i came out here one time and i had fixed four mounds before and i asked harvey martinez if it was okay if i help you rebuild this mound and he just welcomed me with open arms harvey was far too busy to maintain the whole diamond himself and he did a whole lot of work he said have at her
4053335 that would be ideal to be precise and i have a surveying background i mean i like lines straight and i like everything straight i like batters boxes where they are supposed to be i have heard a few umpires say i know that guy is fussy but i think they like it too when things line up straight and i know what the mound is supposed to be like because i read the rule book at lot of places i go i am sure that they do not know how things are supposed to be
4053336 police may ignore minor crimes as front line workers begun a work to rule in their escalating pay dispute

4053338 that was not sufficient to offset the losses in terms of low price brands
4053339 isnt it true that people dont like ads on youtube
4053340 we have not figured that out yet youre comparing a 50 year old mature model that works really well once every four years in the olympics versus something thats just starting
4053341 like to make money out of it youtube but if we dont the fact that so many people come to youtube means they ultimately go to youtube id be worried if people werent using youtube we know we will benefit
4053342 we dont have to choose between national security and protecting the environment
4053343 todays agreement maintains the navys ability to test and train while shielding whales and other vulnerable species from harmful underwater noise
4053344 this agreement confirms we can achieve environmental protection while maintaining our important national security standards
4053345 it does not need to be an either or scenario when it comes to ensuring our waters are protected and our marine wildlife is healthy
4053346 limiting sonar use in breeding grounds and other key habitat areas is essential for the conservation of whales dolphins and other marine mammals
4053347 this agreement protects both national security and our most treasured natural resources
4053348 its such a privilege to serve as president of this academy
4053349 its a dynamic time for our organization and our art form im incredibly proud to be part of it
4053350 the secretary will use all the capabilities of the department as he sees necessary to carry out the mission that the president has given us
4053351 this mission will be vigorous and ongoing a u s c 17 aircraft with humanitarian supplies is on its way and in the days ahead we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4053352 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit

4053359 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan

4053374 with the express condition that the funds be used to benefit low income disabled or elderly consumers of prescription medications to promote lower drug costs for residents of that state to educate consumers concerning the cost differences among medications
4053375 one of the best ways to protect consumers is to help them save money
4053376 this unique settlement will help thousands of michigan residents save money on prescriptions drugs
4053377 new jerseys participation in this national investigation reflects its continued commitment to protect new jersey investors and the settlement provides necessary relief to investors who were mislead into believing that their auction rate security investments were liquid and as safe as cash
4053378 this settlement with ubs resulted from a well coordinated national effort that new jersey participated in
4053379 the resolution today represents another major step in the bureaus efforts with other state regulators to obtain much needed relief for investors whose auction rate securities were frozen and their value impaired the continuing efforts by the bureaus enforcement chief richard barry have again resulted in a positive outcome benefiting new jersey investor victims

4053382 im pleased that president bush has moved to issue this disaster declaration to provide financial assistance to communities
4053383 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed
4053384 recent storms have caused significant damage in many communities across new hampshire which is why we are asking fema to begin assessments to determine eligibility for federal assistance

4053390 i appreciate dannys distinguished years of service in the legislature and look forward to his contributions as a member of the parole board

4053393 this project means supplying american energy produced by american workers to the country this is the first new coal mine in montana in 30 years and will be a significant contributor to our nations energy security

4053395 yesterday tribal leaders made an important decision that will not only benefit their own people but will be a huge step in ensuring energy security for the united states
4053396 i want to extend to chairman venne my deepest gratitude in being a part of the solution
4053397 corn belongs on the tables of our hard working families not in the gas tank
4053398 the epas decision is regrettable because food to fuel mandates drive up food prices and may do more to harm the environment than good
4053399 turning over one quarter of our corn into ethanol last year barely made a dent in our oil consumption clearly turning food into fuel cannot end our petroleum dependency to be sure ethanol has been a welcome boon to many communities but surely there are better and more sustainable ways to grow rural economies without promoting a policy that is literally taking the food out of hungry mouths here in america and around the world

4053401 our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of those involved in the accident that took place on the bay bridge early sunday morning the unique nature of this incident and its aftermath have posed challenges for us all but i want to commend the response of our state and local agencies and first responders for their quick and decisive action when they arrived on the scene i also want to recognize the tremendous effort of the bridge inspection engineering and maintenance crews that have worked diligently the past two days to make the necessary repairs and ensure the bridge is safe for travel every resource has been utilized to restore normal operations at the bay bridge it goes without saying that the patience and understanding of the thousands of motorists who have had to deal with the traffic at the bridge since the incident is greatly appreciated
4053402 the right to vote is the most fundamental element of any democracy
4053403 i could not be more proud to sign this legislation to ensure that those who have sacrificed so much to protect our rights have the opportunity to participate fully in the electoral process
4053404 in a society powered by technology it is only logical to make proper use of all the tools at our disposal
4053405 in signing this legislation we are giving realistic access to our democratic system to the people who have taken on the responsibility of defending it overseas
4053406 the act of voting should not be a daunting or impossible task simply because a person is an ocean away from home
4053407 its past time that we streamlined the process to account for the near global connectivity afforded us by the advent of the internet and e mail
4053408 our election laws must be reflective of the times so that the act of voting even for someone overseas or at war is as simple as possible
4053409 for too long new jerseys election laws have lagged far behind the state of current technology
4053410 with the prevalence of e mail and other forms of electronic transmission state election regulators can easily and cheaply communicate with potential voters wherever they are in the world thanks to this new law we can increase participation in the democratic process in new jersey particularly for those in our military serving overseas
4053411 we must give our brave men and women from new jersey that are serving in the armed forces overseas every opportunity to have a voice in their government
4053412 by making it easier for state residents overseas to vote electronically we can guarantee that our soldiers who have sacrificed so much for their country arent forced to sacrifice their right to vote
4053413 as the state purchases new vehicles for its fleet more and more of our cars trucks and vans will run on alternative fuels
4053414 with these new e 85 facilities well continue to make marylands transportation fleet less dependant on fossil fuels strengthening the energy future of our state for generations to come these upfront investments in our alternative fuel infrastructure position maryland to take advantage of the rapid advances in the next generation of non food based ethanol while reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4053415 because of gov omalleys bold leadership maryland continues to lead by example our commitment to strengthening our sustainable future for our children is evident in the investments we make
4053416 maryland will stand up for the environment and future generations by investing in sound renewable energy policies like the construction of facilities like these
4053417 reducing the states dependence on foreign sources of oil has never been a more pressing issue and greater use of e 85 and other renewable fuels can help us do that
4053418 with 1 200 flex fuel vehicles already in the states fleet we are striving to reduce reliance on fossil fuel and its harmful impacts on the environment
4053419 with the proper state leadership alternative vehicles such as e 85 cars and plug in electric hybrids can become common on marylands roads during the next ten years
4053420 by reducing our reliance on foreign oil maryland can advance our economic security our national security and our environmental security at the same time
4053421 we have yet to take full advantage of the renewed interest in shellfish aquaculture that offers a great economic and environmental restoration opportunity for our coastal bays
4053422 no time is better than the present to develop new and expand established local businesses that can utilize renewable natural resources to create sustainable economic and cultural benefits
4053423 we appreciate governor omalleys visit to our oyster farm to learn how local shellfish aquaculture is helping to resurrect the legendary chincoteague bay oyster and improve water quality in our coastal bays its great to see the state supporting one of the true potential growth spots in our rural economy
4053424 maryland has an outstanding reputation for high quality seafood oysters are critical to our economy our environment and our states identity
4053425 aquacultures potential to increasing the number of oysters and clams living in the coastal bays could make a significant difference in the bays health
4053426 aquaculture also provides a unique opportunity to diversify business opportunities for our watermen and rural resource based seafood industries
4053427 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4053431 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4053432 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4053437 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4053438 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4053439 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4053440 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4053441 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4053442 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4053443 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4053527 its no surprise that john mccain whose chief foreign policy advisor was a paid lobbyist for the government of georgia calls for a militant response by the nato alliance formed in 1949 as a counterweight to the soviet union but even the candidate for change barack obama calls on the international community to condemn this aggression russias not georgias and advocates georgias admission to nato such rhetoric is an almost pavlovian reaction to ugly images of russian tanks on the move acting with trademark ruthlessness to stamp out their enemy and any innocent victims who stand in the way but lets get real here neoconservative pundit robert kagan may assert that the details of who did what to precipitate russias war against georgia are not very important but the details are unimportant only because he wants to blame russia for violence unleashed by georgia

4053566 the disfigurement of the cheeks is shaving the hair of the cheeks

4053569 so let those beware who oppose from his the prophets order lest fitnah trial tribulation strike them or a painful punishment
4053570 and that is he leaves its hair and does not cut like the moustaches from explanation of

4053572 those who make images will be punished on the day of resurrection and it will be said to them bring to life that which you have created
4053573 the people who will be most severely punished on the day of resurrection will be those who imitate the creation of allaah
4053574 part of a mans happiness includes a good neighbour a comfortable mount and a spacious abode
4053575 four things are part of happiness a righteous wife a spacious abode a good neighbour and a comfortable mount and four things are part of misery a bad wife a bad neighbour a bad mount and a small abode

4053578 i can find a thousand wives but i cannot find another brother or sister
4053579 say to the believing men that they should lower their sight and guard their private parts that will make for greater purity for them indeed all h is well acquainted with all that they do
4053580 whosoever leaves something for the sake of all h then all h the mighty and magnificent will replace it with something better than it
4053581 thus did we order so that we might turn away from him all evil and indecent actions for he was one of our sincere servants
4053582 whosoever builds his outward form upon following the sunnah his internal form upon perpetual contemplation and awareness of all h he restrains his soul from following desires he lowers his gaze from the forbidden things and he always eats the lawful things then his perception and insight shall never be wrong
4053583 whosoever opposes his base desires the shayt n shall flee in terror from his shade
4053584 so do not lose heart nor fall into despair for you must gain mastery if you are true in faith
4053585 if any do seek for nobility and power then to all h belongs all nobility and power
4053586 the people seek nobility and power at the door of the kings and they will not find it except through the obedience of all h
4053587 the one who you take as a friend is not humiliated and the one who you take as an enemy is not ennobled
4053588 indeed you will not leave anything for the sake of all h except that all h will replace it with something better than it

4053595 do you think i am just saying this because i am sick i hope not in fact i may live longer than people who are not sick how long are you going to live hanan perhaps twenty years maybe forty then what
4053596 theres no difference between us were all going to leave this world to live in paradise or agonize in hell listen to the words of allah

4053600 and the believers men and women are protecting friends one of another they enjoin the right and forbid the wrong and they establish worship and they pay the poor due and they obey all h and his messenger as for these all h will have mercy on them lo all h is mighty wise
4053601 and they women have rights similar to those of men over them in a just manner
4053602 whoso does an ill deed he will be repaid the like thereof while whoso does right whether male or female and is a believer all such will enter the garden where they will be nourished without stint
4053603 let the woman learn in silence with all subjection but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression
4053604 let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church
4053605 wives be subject to your own husbands as to the lord for the husband is the head of the wife as christ also is the head of the church he himself being the savior of the body but as the church is subject to christ so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything
4053606 and of his signs is this he created for you spouses from yourselves that you might find tranquillity in them and he ordained between you love and mercy lo herein indeed are signs for folk who reflect
4053607 the best believers are the best in conduct and the best of you are those who are best to their wives
4053608 a bad wife brings humiliation downcast looks and a wounded heart slack of hand and weak of knee is the man whose wife fails to make him happy woman is the origin of sin and it is through her that we all die do not leave a leaky cistern to drip or allow a bad wife to say what she likes if she does not accept your control divorce her and send her away
4053609 but consort with them in kindness for if you hate them it may happen that you hate a thing wherein all h has placed much good
4053610 but if her father forbids her when he hears about it none of her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand her husband may confirm or nullify any vow she makes or any sworn pledge to deny herself
4053611 and covet not the thing in which all h has made some of you excel others unto men a fortune from that which they have earned and unto women a fortune from that which they have earned envy not one another but ask all h of his bounty verily all h is knower of all things
4053612 a virgin who is raped must marry her rapist if they are
4053613 if a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered he shall pay the girls father fifty shekels of silver he must marry the girl for he has violated her he can never divorce her as long as he lives
4053614 and those who launch a charge against chaste women and produce not four witnesses to support their allegations flog them with eighty stripes and reject their evidence ever after for such men are wicked transgressors
4053615 and the man adam said the woman eve whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee
4053616 o adam dwell with your wife in the garden and enjoy as you wish but approach not this tree or you run into harm and transgression
4053617 speak unto the children of israel saying if a woman have conceived seed and born a male child then she shall be unclean seven days according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised and she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying thirty three days she shall touch no hallowed thing nor come into the sanctuary until the days of her purifying be fulfilled but if she bear a female child then she shall be unclean two weeks as in her separation and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying sixty six days
4053618 and i find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains the man who pleases god will escape her but the sinner she will ensnare while i was still searching but not finding i found one upright man among a thousand but not one upright woman among them all
4053619 and their lord has heard them and he says verily i suffer not the work of any worker male or female to be lost you proceed one from another
4053620 and whoso does good works whether of male or female and he or she is a believer such will enter paradise and they will not be wronged the dint in a date stone
4053621 whosoever does right whether male or female and is a believer him verily we shall quicken with good life and we shall pay them a recompense in proportion to the best of what they used to do
4053622 a man asked the prophet muhammad sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam whom should i honor most
4053623 and every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonours her head it is just as though her head were shaved if a woman does not cover her head she should have her hair cut off and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or shaved off she should cover her head a man ought not to cover his head since he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of man for man did not come from woman but woman from man neither was man created for woman but woman for man for this reason and because of the angels the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head
4053624 but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head
4053625 judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god with her head uncovered
4053626 say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty and say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what ordinarily appear thereof that they should draw their veils over their bosoms
4053627 o prophet tell your wives and daughters and the believing women that they should cast their outer garments over their bodies when abroad so that they should be known and not molested
4053628 unto the men of a family belongs a share of that which parents and near kindred leave and unto the women a share of that which parents and near kindred leave whether it be little or much a legal share
4053629 and if a woman have an issue her period menses and her issue in her flesh be blood she shall be put apart seven days and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even and every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean and whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even and whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even and if it be on her bed or on any thing whereon she sitteth when he toucheth it he shall be unclean until the even it goes on and on
4053630 do you go out to the market in a single garment
4053631 allah has more right that he is dressed up for
4053632 the people of knowledge love for one to be enveloped in his garments that he beautifies himself for his prayer as much as he is able with regards to his clothes applies perfume and cleanses his teeth miswaak
4053633 o children of adam take your adornment by wearing your clean clothes
4053634 while a man was praying with his lower garment hanging down the messenger sallallahu alaihi wa sallam said to him
4053635 o messenger of allah why do you ask him to do wudhu
4053636 he was praying while his lower garment was hanging down i e he was a musbil
4053637 allah does not look at the prayer of a person who lets his lower garment flow out of pride
4053638 whoever lets his lower garment hang down over or below the ankles from vanity then there is neither ease from allah nor anything blessed
4053639 the prayer is correct behind the innovator and the one who is a musbil and one who has some other sin according to what is more right from what the scholars say as long as it is not a bidah of disbelief kufr for the person if it is a bidah of disbelief like that of a jahmee and similar to that which takes a person outside the fold of islaam then it is not correct to pray behind such people however it is obligatory for those responsible amongst the people that they choose the imam to be of a pleasing character and safe from bidah and immorality this is because being an imam is a great and important trust amaanah he stands as an example to the muslims by it thus it is not permissible to render its custodianship to the people of innovation and immorality when others are able to be appointed
4053640 whatever hangs below both ankles from the lower garment izaar is in the fire
4053641 allah will not speak to three types of people nor will he look at them on the day of judgement nor will he purify them and they will have a painful punishment the person who is a musbil with regard to his garment
4053642 whoever lets his garment flow upon and beneath the ankles due to vanity allah will not look at him on the day of judgement
4053643 i have been ordered to prostrate upon seven bones and that i neither tuck up the hair nor the garment thawb
4053644 as for what i see it is makrooh to pray with the head bare and this is indisputable
4053645 this is not from the good manners from the customs of the salaf to have the head uncovered and walk like that on the road and enter places of worship like that but it is from the ways of the foreigner which has infiltrated the islamic lands when the disbelievers set foot in it and imported their corrupt custom and the muslims imitated them in it so repel it and its likes this is an extraordinary accident and it is not appropriate that it should warrant contradicting the prior islamic culture and be taken as an excuse for permission to pray without head covering
4053646 go to abu jahm ibn hudhaifah with this garment and bring me an inbijaaniyyah because this has distracted me too much in my prayer
4053647 remove it from me because its pictures keep on turning my attention away from my prayer
4053648 i had a garment with pictures on it which i had spread out and the messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam was praying towards it
4053649 as for the garment which has a picture or a cross or whatever draws the attention away then praying in it or towards it or on it is makrooh due to the hadeeth
4053650 this is the dress of the disbelievers so do not clothe yourself with it
4053651 why didnt you clothe some of your family with it there is no harm in the ladies using it
4053652 concerning praying in red garments our companions have said it is makrooh for a man to clothe in it and pray in it
4053653 day of hell for two young danes dressed as muslim women
4053654 i was shocked at the numerous disgraceful comments and the huge wall of hostility we were confronted by when we were walking on the street people went beyond all the norms of respect and good behaviour
4053655 it was shocking to see people behaving in such a shameful way it was worse than i had imagined i wanted to go straight home and change confronting so much hatred was unbearable
4053656 our theory is that they are frightened by things which are unknown to them surveys show that 80 percent of danes have had no personal contact with ethnic minorities
4053657 the experience on the bus shows that hostility and the creation of enemies are things which learned not something people are born with
4053658 were just seeing enormous traffic record levels that weve frankly never seen before

4053672 aan de mast is een schuin omhoog staand lang rondhout van zon 300 kilo bevestigd om het grootzeil langs op te voeren bij een plotseling opstekende storm kan het schip daardoor echter eenvoudig kapseizen
4053673 wij kijken altijd een beetje neer op de techniek uit vroegere eeuwen toch zit het ontwerp ongelooflijk slim en intelligent in elkaar ik denk dat wij met onze geavanceerde computertechnieken op ongeveer dezelfde constructie zouden uitkomen
4053674 de kont van het schip zit inderdaad hoog niet omdat dat mooi was nee maar om daarmee te voorkomen dat tijdens het vissen de golven van achteren naar binnen slaan

4053678 vanzelfsprekend zijn er veel kampgezichten en interieurs van barakken te zien voedsel of beter het gebrek daaraan is een veel voorkomend thema net als arbeid van corvee in het kamp tot en met loodzware dwangarbeid aan de beruchte birmaspoorlijn ziekte en dood zijn ook belangrijke onderwerpen maar de activiteiten die mensen ondernamen om de tijd door te komen als musiceren spelletjes spelen lezen en cabaret zijn aanmerkelijk vaker verbeeld
4053679 det g r inte att ppna den h r bilden eftersom den redigeras i ett annat program
4053680 op beide vragen zou ik een positief antwoord willen geven
4053681 de gereformeerde hermeneutiek is als het erop aankomt de enig juiste
4053682 familienaam binnen de catholica andere families zijn de lutherse de rooms katholieke de oosters orthodoxe en de pentecostale men kan twisten over de vraag of je ook de anglicaanse apart zou moeten noemen maar ik ga ervan uit dat deze in de grond van de zaak in elk geval historisch gezien lid is van de gereformeerde familie
4053683 ook kwalitatief zozeer uitsteekt boven alle andere dat ze er aanspraak op kan maken de enig juiste te zijn
4053684 komt het vreemd over om staande te houden dat n manier van bijbellezen en dan toevallig nog die welke we in onze eigen traditie aantreffen de enig juiste is
4053685 want dan komt het erop aan dan is er een besef van urgentie het is de tijd waarin beslissingen vallen die bepalend zijn voor de toekomst
4053686 welnu als ik zeg dat de gereformeerde hermeneutiek de beste is dan bedoel ik daarmee dat het in de theologie misschien wel permanent verkiezingstijd is met andere woorden het komt er permanent op aan welke theologische keuzes wij maken
4053687 daar hangt veel van af als het gaat om onze verhouding tot god aan wie we de bijbel uiteindelijk te danken hebben er hangt ook veel van af voor het leven van de kerk en via de kerk voor de samenleving
4053688 hoe wij zullen denken geloven en leven d t is de inzet van de reformatie

4053781 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences
4053782 this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
4053783 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms

4053789 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to 10 followers you arent charged ten times thats because weve been footing the bill when we launched our free sms service to the world we set the clock ticking as the service grew in popularity so too would the price
4053790 even with a limit of 250 messages received per week it could cost twitter about 1 000 per user per year to send sms outside of canada india or the us it makes more sense for us to establish fair billing arrangements with mobile operators than it does to pass these high fees on to our users

4053807 mon id e du romantisme est proche des th ories de denis de rougemont cest en relation avec le sentiment amoureux non partag le romantisme implique dattendre de se languir il suppose des d ceptions et ventuellement le suicide a doit mal se passer quelque part quand les deux personnes sont enfin r unies on sort de lamour romanesque et on rentre dans lamour r aliste

4053826 noch vor wenigen jahren war die partnersuche im internet gesellschaftlich noch nicht sehr angesehen
4053827 die suche nach einer neuen liebe im netz wird heute als ganz normale legitime methode angesehen jeder sechste internetnutzer findet inzwischen einen partner im web
4053828 die tendenz ist klar steigend vor einem jahr hatten wir noch 750 000 mitglieder

4053836 at this stage we do not consider funds will be available for distribution to unsecured creditors
4053837 hopefully these markets will get some kind of reprieve and were going to see more of a settled period thank god
4053838 the whole emphasis in terms of where we go is all the focus on the commodities
4053839 there is still reasonable volatility we are right in the middle of a very thin month a lot of people on vacation and scaling down their positions
4053840 there is some upside sustainability but our market is so heavily weighted toward oil and commodity stock that our ability to really rally aggressively by the year end is fairly limited
4053841 we saw a switch in focus from the bank of england which is now seeing through short term inflation problems this is what sent sterling spinning
4053842 nonetheless aggressive rate cuts are likely through 2009 as recession risks mount
4053843 around 100 people have been sick with this specific strain of salmonella agona since around may
4053844 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4053845 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4053846 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4053847 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4053848 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4053849 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4053850 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4053851 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4053852 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4053853 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4053854 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4053855 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4053856 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4053857 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4053858 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4053859 lets go for this movie so and so newspaper gave it a 3 5 rating
4053860 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4053861 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4053862 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4053863 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4053864 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4053865 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4053866 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4053867 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4053868 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4053869 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4053870 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4053871 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4053872 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4053873 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4053874 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4053875 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4053876 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

4053881 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4053882 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4053883 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4053884 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4053885 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4053886 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4053887 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4053888 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4053889 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4053890 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4053891 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4053892 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4053893 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4053894 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4053895 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4053896 how to retire rich in a totally changed world why youre not in kansas anymore
4053897 this operation is a hint and may be overridden by the platform for example on windows the background of a button cannot be changed
4053898 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4053899 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4053900 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4053901 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4053902 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4053903 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4053904 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4053905 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4053906 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4053907 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4053908 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4053909 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4053910 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4053911 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

4053921 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4053922 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4053923 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4053924 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4053925 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4053926 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4053927 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4053928 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4053929 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4053930 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4053931 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4053932 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4053933 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

4053995 and i think ridge is a great example of that

4054058 not all mexicans have a lot of kids no more than any other race
4054059 this one has a narrow banking and long straights so for the guys of the pursuit squad say the changes willl tend to be a little bit later because the speed is higher
4054060 so guys will rejoin the squad further down the straight than they otherwise would therell be more expansion and contraction of the squad gaps between the riders than you would get on a circuit thats more of a bowl
4054061 thats not too difficult the toughest thing to get used to here is the steepness of the track but rather than the banking itself the exits and entries into those bankings it holds you in a little bit more
4054062 longer straights like at laoshan feel different they make for harder work because youre working for longer and you begin to lose your rev on the straights
4054063 in manchester say which is rounder you get your momentum to go into the next banking and the next banking here your momentums that little bit less before you get thrown around the next bend
4054064 you can get a lot of speed gain because its steep ultimately it just feels different
4054065 im no engineer but its certainly a very solid structure well put together very quiet too because i believe the wood is laid on concrete not wooden beams
4054066 itll make for fast racing in fact youll probably find that people tend to go out a little too fast and there will be a definite risk of blowing in the last kilometre
4054067 on circuits like this when youre fresh youre fine but when you come into the last part you have to really work to get your speed
4054068 were expecting temperatures of around 26 degrees which is fine in manchester this spring the temperature was around 24 or 25 degrees
4054069 ive not been to los angeles but they say its not dis similar or to copenhagen or bochum in germany or perth in australia where we did some training for six weeks
4054070 is this because of the wooden box in the storehouse what is the box
4054071 you found the box where is the box now are you alright
4054072 its because i didnt tell anything i have to tell something to your family
4054073 mr j shouldnt the box be at your house there is a book to administrate where the box is in my shrine now its superstitious to talk about a curse and people may think its just a made up story but i was told about the box by my father and grandfather since i was child and i saw them exorcise the box they looked very serious when they talk about the box and some from your family died for this box before wasnt it
4054074 im angry of course my father is but its very hard to keep the promise from the ancestors who you havent met before i can understand that you want to escape i also wanted to escape when i saw the box a few days ago it must be very scary to keep the box at your home for 10 years or decades but s and k are women who can give birth to children if s didnt meet me on the day she found the box she might have been dead and something more horrible might occur in other families mr j could you tell me why this happened and this one a s family name is you may think hes outsider but hes
4054075 first id better explain about the box chippou a thought it is shippou but it was chippou was administrated by three families s j and t from generation to generation it was the box distributed to these three families the box was preserved by these families when the owner of the house is dead the next owner of the house hands it to the next family and the next family tell the story of the box to his successor and keep it until he dies the owner who has the box has to keep children and women away from the box and the families who dont have the box have to observe the family who owns the box and when the fixed year passed and the curse of the box expired the last owner returns the box to ms shrine to exorcise it
4054076 a few years go ss grandfather died it was my familys turn but ss father didnt bring the box to me then i sounded him about the box at the funeral and i found he didnt know about the box
4054077 im sorry but i was really scared ts father died after he owned the box soon and soon ss grandfather died i knew the box doesnt curse men but it was too scary we decided to leave the box in the ss storehouse and just keep eyes on the storehouse until the day when the curse of the box expires and im really sorry even if some of ss family dies due to the box ss family doesnt know about the curse so we thought we wont be blamed im sorry im really sorry

4054104 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
4054105 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
4054106 whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind

4054128 yeah its true it is and i read the script its fantastic but im shooting at the very same time i wont be able to do it not going to happen but i did read it it is awesome i know quentin for a long time weve been talking about doing it for years for like five six seven years
4054129 said hed just spoken with the embattled president of the republic of georgia
4054130 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
4054131 mccain suggested the us did not adequately recognize russias threat
4054132 im not sure that we did obviously i did and i said they shouldnt stay in the g8 and i said that i thought that vladimir putin was most interested in restoring the old russian empire
4054133 said the russian invasion was meant to send a signal to nations that are friendly to the west barack obama vacationing in hawaii put out a statement repeating his call for russia to stop its attacks
4054134 rhetoric has become increasingly sharp on tuesday he called russia an unrepentant combatant against a brave little nation and compared russian killing in the tiny little democracy to soviet aggression during the cold war era
4054135 has confronted the crisis in georgia in more modulated tones initially sounding closer to bush than mccain but later condemning the russian aggression in strong terms saying there was no possible justification for it

4054143 said the states small town voters cling to guns and religion because they are bitter a gaffe that possibly contributed to mr obamas loss in the state primary and might haunt his general election campaign in this battleground
4054144 the question was asked over and over once the battle ended why did senator clinton lose now the atlantic magazine has published leaked memos from inside the clinton campaign that detail the decisions and indecisions that shaped the campaign including bitter internal fights about how to position the candidate but the most eye opening revelation one directly related to the fall campaign is that clinton strategist mark penn was arguing that obama had to be attacked as an outsider a stranger an alien
4054145 to look now at some of john mccains tv and web ads it is almost as if his campaign is following penns outsider strategy to the letter for instance the constant reference to obama as a celebrity
4054146 appears to have less hesitation than clintons did in going after obama for the past few weeks it has run a series of negative ads some humorous some not so that portray obama as a famous but empty suit who is wrong on many of the issues americans care most about the ads at a minimum may be getting under obamas skin its possible they are doing real damage
4054147 may be ready to allow a vote on offshore drilling but that doesnt mean shes going to make it easy on the republicans whove been goading her for weeks on energy
4054148 stressed that it would have to be part of a larger energy package and the contents of that package might include some items that would be tough for republicans and the energy industry to swallow like a renewable portfolio standard and the democrats signature use it or lose it legislation
4054149 have some measures republicans deeply oppose and speaker pelosi in that interview hinted at one of them a so called windfall profits tax
4054150 members of the bipartisan senate gang of 10 should embrace energy legislation introduced by house republicans or face opposition from house gop for a fatally flawed proposal a member of house leadership wrote in a letter to the senate group on tuesday
4054151 said house republicans would oppose the new energy reform act in its current form and criticized the bill as too narrow an approach that will raise prices on consumers
4054152 republicans have used the offshore drilling issue to paint democrats as out of touch with ordinary americans and beholden to environmental groups that oppose any relaxation of the current drilling ban

4054158 the first thing gary did when he came in was have a meeting with me he wanted to see if i was okay and was everything fine and it was
4054159 there were no problems between me and sammy lee other than our opinions
4054160 it was just the confidence that gary brought that helped me i think he gave confidence to the whole squad
4054161 you always say its a test of character when you go through tough times
4054162 when you look over the 38 games i think i had a half decent season i was delighted with how it ended
4054163 if we start how we ended last season we wont have any problems
4054164 we have the same team plus one or two good additions and we are looking forward to the season getting up and running
4054165 but it will be a tough game against stoke because there are a lot of players in their side who want to prove themselves in the premier league
4054166 he is good in the air and has a good eye for goal in and out of the box
4054167 if az make their interest official then blackburn will have to make a decision
4054168 when there was interest in the winter rovers were very clear that they would not sell
4054169 thats why i dont imagine it will be easy now because andre is an important player
4054170 but he is very interested in the possibilities available at az

4054181 we must begin to take the accusation that the jewish people are trying to control the world very seriously american jewry makes any debate on whether the protocols of the elder of zion are an authentic document or rather a forgery irrelevant american jews do try to control the world by proxy i would suggest that perhaps we should face it once and for all the jews were responsible for the killing of jesus who by the way was himself a palestinian jew
4054182 ive kind of given that up now and i just play along
4054183 its one of those dreams you have as a child in america

4054187 i had started having some pain in my hips for a few months but im kind of a self confident person and thought i could diagnose myself
4054188 i would ice my joints and take anti inflammatories and just push through
4054189 my doctor said i needed to stop running and quit doing impact sports and i handled it real well
4054190 i went home and told my husband my life was over my husband is a funny guy too he suggested my life wasnt over i was just going to have to join the real world and get myself a job
4054191 i could win a gold medal and people on the street would still ask me about lance
4054192 but thats ok i dont think he has a gold medal
4054193 wir haben uns f r das konsolidierungsjahr 2008 ehrgeizige ziele gesetzt von denen wir berzeugt sind sie erreichen zu k nnen
4054194 nur eine deutliche erh hung des fernstra enetats schafft die m glichkeit den anforderungen des verkehrswachstums nachzukommen sanierungsstaus zu beseitigen verkehrsengp sse und staus aufzul sen und damit auch f r verkehrssicherheit l rm und klimaschutz zu sorgen die zweckbindung der lkw maut und der verzicht auf eine quersubventionierung anderer verkehrstr ger durch den stra eng terverkehr ist der entscheidende schritt in diese richtung
4054195 das schl sselkriterium bei der entscheidung zugunsten von open text war die einfachheit mit der sich die l sungen des anbieters in unsere umgebung auf basis von sap integrieren lassen
4054196 kein anderes anbietergespann als open text und sap k nnte citrix systems besser bei seinem rechnungseingangsprojekt unterst tzen zusammen verf gen sie ber die richtige kombination aus technologie und expertise
4054197 der rechnungseingangsprozess verfolgt ein einfaches ziel rechnungen korrekt zu bezahlen gleichzeitig ist dieser prozess in der regel sehr arbeitsintensiv rechnungen und zugeh rige dokumente auf papier f hren zu zeit und geldverschwendung weil sie eingeordnet aus dem archiv beschafft kopiert versandt oder aufw ndig gesucht werden m ssen wenn sie falsch abgelegt sind
4054198 ohne eine effektive prozessorientierte l sung ist es praktisch unm glich kriterien zu entwickeln anhand derer sich kosten reduzieren und regularien besser erf llen lassen unsere rechnungseingangsl sungen bieten umfassende funktionalit ten mit denen die rechnungsbearbeitung beschleunigt und automatisiert werden kann dadurch werden die kostentreibenden probleme in allen transaktionen beseitigt
4054199 aufgrund der vielen verschiedenen produktvarianten wurde die qualit tskontrolle bisher manuell durchgef hrt
4054200 wir brauchten digitalkameras die trotz schwieriger lichtverh ltnisse und rotation des rings eine hohe bildqualit t liefern
4054201 dank der integrierten smart features und der kurzen verschlusszeit liefern die avt kameras eine sehr gute bildqualit t

4054209 the customers of a technology company were up in arms about the service provided by offshore agents citing the agents lack of technical skills turns out the agents were near experts in their technical capability the real issue was that customers were frustrated by the agents relentless tendency to stick rigidly to scripted responses we hear of incidents like this on a routine basis at ciac
4054210 our order book for winter sports 08 09 is now complete and as anticipate we have only recovered about half of the sales lost 2007
4054211 overall we anticipate tough trading conditions for the remainder of 2008 and we continue to anticipate that we will record an operating loss for 2008
4054212 some of the supervisors and stuff were kind of teary eyed
4054213 i absolutely think some of them will apply now the timing isnt perfect for them because theyve been working on hiring the first group but they are growing and expanding
4054214 we have a wonderful work force and everyone i have met has been so qualified and so friendly
4054215 i think customer service is really going to thrive here

4054225 its a very murky underground that most people dont know exists
4054226 as soon as we start doing this i guarantee well find less of them because theyre going to get smart and change the way they do business
4054227 then well be back to tracking them down and putting it all together like a puzzle and thats when it gets real messy
4054228 they shut down at one location move across the street to another change the name and its basically the same individuals
4054229 this underscores the difference between responsible operators which are our core members and the unlawful rogues who imperil public safety
4054230 i would like to think if somebody saw that bus and knew there was an out of service order for angel tours they would have connected the dots and said hey we think weve got a problem here and looked at it

4054233 the biggest game of the season is the qualifier for the champions league
4054234 you can miss a premier league game and catch back up but if you miss this champions league game
4054235 it is not about the money it is our sports target
4054236 i would not say that our season is over of we lose but our main targets are the premier league and the champions league and the champions league can only be a target if you are in it
4054237 its a big day with a big meaning for us because the target to be in the champions league is very high
4054238 you know that when you come to holland you always get a good game and a tough game no matter where you play
4054239 we know as well this side demands a lot of respect and concentration they are a team who have knocked out ajax in the qualifiers of the champions league we know they have the typical dutch culture of playing football and keeping the ball very well therefore we need a good defensive concentration
4054240 if you consider we have song at the olympics plus fabregas rosicky toure senderos diaby nasri and eduardo all injured then our squad is not as small as that
4054241 i have said many times we were short of one player and i hope to do something this week before the transfer deadline
4054242 we are used to preparing the players to replace those who leave the club
4054243 i believe many players become big stars at our club but usually they are replaced by players who will become big stars at our club

4054247 cuts in programs would have to be considerably above 1 billion to meet patersons state savings figure

4054254 we have totally reclaimed the villages occupied by rebels but troops are still clearing the areas of land mines left behind by the milf forces
4054255 they want to attend to their farms and return to their normal life but land mines and unexploded munitions are posing a danger to civilians
4054256 troops are carefully clearing the areas slowly and inch by inch to really ensure that no explosives are left behind
4054257 we have complied with the agreement between the cease fire committees to reposition our forces to avoid further clashes

4054263 the past year has been very exciting for us because a record number of leading corporations made the decision to deploy our open dataminer end to end network management platform this includes amongst other broadcast australia czech television enex gateway communications m6 mtv overon roshan rtl tvi stratos global telstraclear tve upc etc
4054264 but aside from the many customer wins we were also very pleased to see that the existing customer base continuously expands the scope of their dataminer network management platforms
4054265 today dataminer is one of the most widely deployed open multi vendor network management platforms in the industry and it is continuously gaining momentum mainly based on its merits as being a very open powerful and yet still intuitive and easy to use solution with a very appealing total cost of ownership tag
4054266 dataminer is a state of art multi vendor network management platform and dataminer cube underlines our commitment to our customers and business partners that they will continue to dispose of the best that technology can offer to some people it may come as a bit of a surprise that we went back to the drawing board as our current generation of uis is already ranked at the top but this is all about being prepared for the future and assuring that our customers can continue to operate more and more efficiently even while their technical ecosystems become more and more complex while preserving the qualities of the existing ui and by leveraging the latest technologies dataminer cube embodies an entirely new highly innovative and above all user centric approach on the end to end management of complex technological ecosystems we spent a massive amount of resources in researching ui techniques and scrutinizing the seemingly most trivial aspects and it has paid off you need to experience dataminer cube in order to fully comprehend what it is all about but dataminer cube is truly going to change the way people look at managing the most complex ecosystems and ibc2008 is a unique opportunity for operators to get a sneak preview

4054290 humans left the caribbean monk seal population unsustainable after overhunting them in the wild
4054291 unfortunately this lead to their demise and labels the species as the only seal to go extinct from human causes
4054292 worldwide populations of the two remaining monk seal species are declining
4054293 we hope weve learned from the extinction of caribbean monk seals and can provide stronger protection for their hawaiian and mediterranean relatives
4054294 the hawaiian monk seal is a treasure to preserve for future generations
4054295 noaas fisheries service has developed a monk seal recovery plan but we need continued support from organizations and the public if we are to have a chance at saving it from extinction time is running out

4054320 there are no products of good quality for men on the market
4054321 should there be such products specifically for men then there is nothing stopping us from selling them
4054322 theres a lot of evidence that the more patients are required to pay more for their care the more that they make economic decisions about what to get or what not
4054323 while some of that may be perfectly reasonable and acceptable what i worry about is people not getting care that is really essential for their health
4054324 we know from past economic downturns that employers and individuals tighten their budgets as a whole but they certainly tighten their health budgets
4054325 our concern was that it creates tremendous confusion for people to get one notice and then another

4054329 the move by ryanair targets booking sites where users are buying flights indirectly without going to the ryanair site skyscanner users are linked directly to official airline websites to book their flights skyscanner does not sell air tickets or take any form of bookings therefore any ryanair flights which have been found via skyscanner will not be affected by ryanairs announcement as all these flights have been booked directly with the airline
4054330 it is not untrue to say flights are usually more expensive from an online travel agent that has screen scraped ryanair fares we have no issue with that but lets say it how it is ryanair is forcing consumers to go to its website because it wants to sell a whole plethora of products from there flights are the hook
4054331 we know from our own price comparative work that ryanair is not always the cheapest for hotels car hire and travel insurance products so consumers should shop around for the best deal if buying such products online
4054332 we are seeing no evidence to suggest that demand is slowing for any of our seasons on sale in addition we are currently recovering input cost inflation for all open seasons across our source markets
4054333 while the evidence to date suggests that consumers view holiday spending as a high priority we continue to prepare the business to deal with any consequences of the current economic climate accordingly we are taking out capacity for the coming seasons where it makes sense to do so and retain significant flexibility to adjust supply further if demand trends change the diversity of our portfolio of businesses provides further protection from risks arising from specific geographies or products next year will also see substantial merger synergy benefits delivered based on work we have already completed
4054334 we continue to believe that we are well placed to recover incremental costs in both financial years 2008 and 2009
4054335 cheapoair pays commission upon booking not on travel consumed so partners get commission payments immediately
4054336 we are making it easy for our partners to increase revenue selling cheapoair travel products and we pay one of the highest commissions in the travel industry the cheapoair affiliate programme offers a wide variety of media options such as banners search widgets rss feeds xml feeds text links coupons newsletters and more
4054337 there is no doubt that the situation in the air travel industry is serious and probably the most difficult it has ever been

4054339 i think this study demonstrates that the problem of refractive eyesight errors is on the increase particularly in terms of the amount of nearsightedness in the american population
4054340 no one knows for sure what accounts for this but its a pretty smart hypothesis that the increased amount of near work that were doing as a population may be increasing the incidence of nearsightedness and it does suggest that we should be looking into ways to deal with it
4054341 i would hazard to suggest that in general the widespread prevalence of refractive issues today could be related to environmental factors like extensive use of tv and computers and among the young video games because today we get much heavier loads on our eyes from all of that and those are strenuous activities for our vision
4054342 half the u s population needs glasses of some sort so this does not strike me as unusual at all
4054343 and so even though many patients routinely come in concerned about having a surgical problem its much more often this sort of issue im a surgeon but im very happy to tell people you dont need surgery and often they dont they just need eyeglasses
4054344 there are studies that link low vitamin d levels to the development of heart disease peripheral arterial disease diabetes hypertension and different cancers
4054345 those who had the lowest levels of vitamin d had a 26 percent higher risk of death from all causes compared to those with the highest vitamin d levels
4054346 i think people should optimize their diet and sun exposure to get an adequate level of vitamin d without taking supplements
4054347 it may be a good idea for people who are at risk for vitamin d deficiency including african americans and people who dont spend a lot of time in the sun to get their vitamin d levels checked by their doctor
4054348 we know that being vitamin d sufficient reduces the risk of having your first heart attack by more than 50 percent reduces the risk of having peripheral vascular disease by as much is 80 percent and decreases the risk of prostate colon breast and a whole host of other cancers by as much is 50 to 70 percent
4054349 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to 10 followers you arent charged ten times thats because weve been footing the bill when we launched our free sms service to the world we set the clock ticking as the service grew in popularity so too would the price
4054350 even with a limit of 250 messages received per week it could cost twitter about 1 000 per user per year to send sms outside of canada india or the us it makes more sense for us to establish fair billing arrangements with mobile operators than it does to pass these high fees on to our users

4054421 but how could you why would you consider fighting against education for our children on a subject we never had an opportunity to learn about growing up dont we want our children to understand and learn about cultures and religions they wouldnt normally know about and isnt is possible that education is the secret or rather the key to stop prejudice the hatred on this site towards islamists is evidence to me that we need more than ever to educate the leaders of our future now before another generation of ignorance exists everything you are saying about islamists will get back to the entire world is this really how we are i saw hall on cnn and i suddenly felt as though i was at a kkk rally to me beauty is based on the level of integrity one has in their heart for human kind and this appears to be a very ugly site full of ugly thoughts

4054457 the criteria for mortgages may still be strict but its nonetheless encouraging to see mortgage rates coming down like this
4054458 essentially any move in this direction bodes well for the housing market implying a return of confidence among lenders which should translate into greater confidence among would be homeowners
4054459 with lenders determined to protect themselves against potential falls in house prices the biggest drops are aimed at those with the largest deposits
4054460 at the moment of course prices are dropping because of the problems in the mortgages market theyre dropping mortgages become cheaper and more readily available theres a high probability that prices will level out or increase nevertheless astute would be homebuyers are fully aware that any increase in prices cant take place overnight and theyre saving up now to make sure they can move as soon as mortgage rates descend to a level they find acceptable but before house prices start to climb once more
4054461 any homeowner thinking of selling their property today faces an unpleasant choice sell now if they can for an average of 9 less than their property would have fetched at the peak of the housing market in october 2007 or wait and hope the market improves
4054462 at the same time the rising cost of mortgages has hit anyone looking to mortgage for example or consolidating their debts this news about falling mortgage rates may be particularly significant for people in this group as so many of them find themselves forced to act within a certain timeframe for them wait and see simply isnt an option

4054482 they told me i had 60 reviews on my yelp page
4054483 they told me no one is going to read all 60
4054484 i think these business owners are mis characterizing whats going on
4054485 there is a remote chance that we have some sort of rogue sales person but i think that its more likely its just a business owner thats pissed off about reviews on his page
4054486 i didnt receive a phone call from yelp until i received a negative review
4054487 a week after i received a negative review a sales person contacted me and she said
4054488 i challenge you to find any advertiser whos had their negative reviews pushed to the bottom
4054489 these sites are ones that attract a certain kind of user and have the best chance of crossing the chasm between early adopters and the mainstream media
4054490 how do i know theres isnt someone in yelps offices clicking away on my page
4054491 we started with pay per call where we focused on businesses that took a bunch of phone calls and then we moved to a program that citysearch has offered for a number of years
4054492 for some local businesses the pay per visit model was a little bit hard to understand
4054493 they offered to have the best review on top for a certain rate and the bad reviews would be last
4054494 i was talking to a friend the other day and they told me that if a business pays yelp com some then yelp will sort the reviews for that business w the better reviews on top
4054495 we do not change the ordering of all reviews for a business advertiser or not how do i know i wrote the code the sic orders the review on our business pages for advertisers we do allow them to call out a specific review it changes from time to time to keep the page fresh but its in a labeled box there is no sorting changes to the rest of the reviews and there is no removal of reviews unless they violate the terms of service for which the same rules apply to both advertisers and regular businesses
4054496 we dont accept advertisers who are below a certain rating threshold
4054497 we want to help great businesses succeed if youve got some issues with your business we cant help you until you rectify them
4054498 you have to start thinking constructively say how can i address this issue if one exists
4054499 and if it doesnt a new customer will eventually walk in the door and theyll post a new review that will move you in a positive direction
4054500 theres a mathematical formula we use i dont know it off the top of my head but its basically factoring time along with how much voting has happened on that review
4054501 theres a fairly quick drop off in the weight given to the time factor initially a fresh review is valued more highly than anything else but then it fades out if it doesnt receive many votes

4054539 the automated elections are a success despite some untoward incidents arising primarily from ballot snatchings in some isolated areas the results remain
4054540 we have set a few firsts in the recent elections

4054544 honda understands that its customers want to hear genuine opinions from real people and the jazz has always had strong positive support from its drivers the pass the jazz campaign will tap into this and enable us to give something back to our loyal customers

4054546 we all find success when we realize our own dreams
4054547 always put in may such as climate change may cause more tornadoes in asia than climate change would result in this and that he stressed
4054548 what we have are only scenarios and scenarios are not facts
4054549 focus more on the solutions to climate change and to adapt to its effects and less on the frightening statistics to move from denial to despair to action
4054550 editors stick to what they know even if facts tell otherwise
4054551 journalists and scientists are the same they both want to know the truth
4054552 fight for it you may be writing the biggest story of the 21st century
4054553 everyone thinks that if we automate the elections then all our problems will go away however if you look at the experience of the united states and other countries who have automated their elections the old problems still persist and new problems crop up
4054554 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
4054555 jonathans been talking about going to the olympics since he started when he was 4

4054557 youll see me i cant watch i close my eyes and pray the whole time
4054558 regardless of his outcome were so proud of him were proud because hes gotten this far
4054559 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4054560 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4054561 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4054562 the figures are disastrous the economy is being hit on all fronts consumption which had been the main contributor to growth for some time is being hit by soaring inflation and tighter lending conditions
4054563 the bad thing is that we do not see a significant change in this situation in the coming months indeed most of the negative factors affecting the economy will remain in place for the rest of 2008 against this backdrop the recession in france defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth is an increasingly likely scenario
4054564 after a couple of hours at their desks on september 12 2001 all the writers on earth were reluctantly considering a change of occupation
4054565 after a couple of hours at their desks on september 12 2001 all the writers on earth were reluctantly considering a change of occupation
4054566 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4054567 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4054568 we are delighted to enhance our existing telephony services with intels innovative hardware based solutions
4054569 we will continue to collaborate with intel to continue our leadership in the ip telephony market
4054570 with this latest innovation jajah has comprehensively moved the ip telephony game from software to hardware
4054571 jajahs ongoing success vindicates our unique investment strategy using our web 2 0 competence and networks we continue to scout for new opportunities that offer significant equity growth potential and will shortly announce details of our most recent deals
4054572 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4054573 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4054579 i knew that i had the opportunity to get the putt in first
4054580 that was important i knew if i holed it i probably would win the pga if i missed sergio would probably win the pga
4054581 so it was down to that and i hit a lovely putt i read it exactly how i wanted it and it did exactly what i expected
4054582 we are working on a new uk anti doping agency and legislation is certainly a possibility
4054583 that is something we are currently discussing with our home office that is something that could be evolving in the next couple of years
4054584 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games

4054592 we are facing the challenge of bringing about political change
4054593 we have looked at our options and want an open discussion in the party on what to do we will have to decide how to behave towards the left
4054594 she has gambled away her own and the hesse spds credibility that is the worst thing for a politician or party
4054595 che importa dei soldi meglio avere una bella ragazza accanto
4054596 eat cookies and other snacks to keep up your energy
4054597 det betyder reelt set at russerne vil have at georgien skal give afkald p sydossetien og abkhasien
4054598 det er urealistisk at georgien g r med til det det vil v re enden p sakasjvilis georgiens pr sident politiske liv hvis han giver afkald p de to udbryderregioner
4054599 det er paradoksalt men rusland vil s dan set ikke have indlemmet sydossetien og abkhasien rusland vil have at sydossetien og abkhasien forbliver i en limbo situation hvor de egentlig er en del af georgien men reelt set har en form for selvstyre rusland vil opretholde den her uafklarede situation i regionerne
4054600 der har foreg et en form for etnisk udrensning i georgien etniske georgiere er blevet presset ud af sydossetien og abkhasien
4054601 mange sydossetere der jo egentlig er georgiere har f et russisk statsborgerskab faktisk er det langt over halvdelen af befolkningen i sydossetien der har russisk statsborgerskab
4054602 hvis man ser kynisk p det s har disse mange russiske statsborgere givet russerne en undskyldning for at g ind i georgien de skal jo beskytte deres borgere
4054603 p papiret er det en voldsomt sv r kamp lin dan p udebane fuldt hus og i kina det er ogs en opgave som man ser frem til helt vildt meget og han kan spille helt frit for alt presset ligger p lin dan
4054604 han havde fra starten inden vi kom til ol snakket om den kvartfinale og da han havde vundet over shoji sato var det det som han havde nsket i lang tid han er helt klar til at v re der i dag
4054605 han skal v re toneangivende p nettet og ikke blot afgive det han har v ret fremragende der i lang tid og s skal han v re god i defensiven og v re h j p boldene
4054606 filled with down home stories and humor for a true picture of how life in the country with only your eight siblings for playmates
4054607 an old time book from a girl in the back woods of maine who had a guardian angel to protect her and teach her about the real world
4054608 the book is the true story of a young girl living a very modest secluded country life in the 1950s in the state of maine she starts by explaining how country folks live life year after year then she takes you though the hard young working years and then how she was tormented mentally in all directions as she enters the real world she just couldnt believe or understand the world and its language being raised as she was in the county going to a catholic school
4054609 as more parents are choosing to home tutor their children for good reasons i found myself compelled to write my true story to help parents understand the long lasting effects of a modest sheltered upbringing before making the final decision i only wish for parents to see how a child may be affected and how these issues also need to be addressed
4054610 in talking to ctos and heads of digital at big media companies they are aware of the semantic web i would venture to say very few of them can articulate its value its still sort of an inside baseball kind of thing
4054611 youve got large media conglomerates like nbc or fox they all have these corporate entities with dozens of brands and under those brands there may be dozens of properties which may have dozens of collections
4054612 at the bottom of this you have lots of content in different formats and its not marked up in any consistent fashion the challenge is simply finding a way to distribute and repurpose their content within their own properties
4054613 once you have that then translating it into a semantic web standard is trivial all that is is a translation engine
4054614 giving them the power to create their own semantic representation of their content and then letting them choose when and how to interface with standards on the web is exactly what they need
4054615 lets say the publisher has a deal with a content provider who needs an ad of a certain source
4054616 if the content comes from this collection and mentions this word then use the following ad tags and call this partners doubleclick dart server you can do this through the console or change the rules and update new ad tags this populates to all templates immediately
4054617 the results were promising and we showed that given some realistic ontologies and domain modeling we could keep up with the news wires
4054618 although the impact on their web sites is clear i believe this may end up being just some kids who got overexcited with georgia being ill prepared to say the least
4054619 and as such we rallied around each other for support
4054620 a mentally disturbed conspiracy theorist wearing a tin foil hat told an audience
4054621 an angry socialist blogger who lives with his mother in massachusetts and never leaves his bedroom
4054622 the patriot act is huge and i remember someone asking a justice department official how did they write such a large statute so quickly and of course the answer was that it has been sitting in the drawers of the justice department for the last 20 years waiting for the event where they would pull it out
4054623 of course the patriot act is filled with all sorts of insanity about changing the way civil rights are protected or not protected in this instance
4054624 every single year spam volumes increase dramatically in the second half of the year and peak by december january before declining in the first months of the new year
4054625 our network management practices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
4054626 ideapad netbooks are the latest in a string of recently announced lenovo products designed specifically for consumers worldwide and developed through our heritage of technological innovation and exceptional engineering
4054627 as rapidly as the technology changes todays consumers are looking for mobile products that feature the best of basic computing functions in an extremely compact and affordable form and lenovo designed the ideapad netbooks for that purpose
4054628 batteries are one of the few products which traditionally have slipped through the recycling net with the support of producers retailers and trade associations in rolling out this new initiative batteries of all kinds including those in the automotive industry can be deposited by consumers for free at specified drop off points where weee ireland will organise for their collection treatment and safe recycling
4054629 there are still quite clearly job opportunities in pharmaceuticals medical devices environmental engineering as well as demand for process and project engineers and with this survey showing salary scales in a number of engineering categories continuing to increase we would strongly advocate those considering career options to look at the lucrative and diverse possibilities the engineering industry can offer them engineering is a fundamental part of any economy and will always be so

4054635 they learn who their users are what they want to do and take the leap to design what works for them
4054636 ondemand allows small startup teams to get all the advantages of an enterprise solution the features are identical and only the service level agreement sla and degree of support varies larger teams of 50 60 users and up will still benefit more from using the full enterprise product either hosted or onsite
4054637 joomla is one of the most powerful open source content management systems on the planet
4054638 freebase is creating the critical mass of a data commons which could be a valuable foundation for the semantic web ecosystem they are actively curating the data with community driven yet centrally coordinated ontologies and data resources
4054639 one machine can index all my file servers with permissioning
4054640 you can view who changed what and when at any level of a given map and literally find who is working on what part of the map in real time
4054641 the semantic web at its core is about tagging capabilities being made available for applications to throw in content and get it back tagged which helps with the ability to associate other content with it with navigation with creating tagged clouds and all kinds of other things
4054642 we made what used to be a half million or quarter million dollar high end deployment of enterprise software available for free with the idea that the more folks use it the better reuters can associate that content back in so our customers can see more of what is going on in the world
4054643 when information is out on the web that is of general interest and possibly of a market moving nature it doesnt easily associate into the way our customers look at the world
4054644 i can tell you this is something we take very seriously
4054645 it is discussed on many dimensions and we have a pretty well thought through stance that says we need to protect the integrity of reuters and our partners validated content but as long as we identify external content as such we find customers benefit from broader access and more information so we just have to make sure it is clear what the source is and how much our brand is attached to it
4054646 simply put it does what it is suppose to do easy to learn easy to use becomes a daily if not hourly tool used to control manage documents team collaboration and enables visual representation of current state of projects and brainstorming
4054647 powerful visualization by mind maps easy navigation by links filters tracking of changes integration with ms office
4054648 because you can go directly from the brainstorming mode to producing an outline of the web site further editing of the map then allows you to add content finally you can deal with the style of the web site by editing templates and css files
4054649 we saw the names that were short listed and obviously there were some very good global names and we were over the moon to have won it
4054650 i think itll help us grow the company over the next 12 months
4054651 i think the main reasons why it became very popular is that we put a lot of effort into the usability of the product making sure non technical people could maintain and author all parts of the intranet giving them the ability to maintain and correct their own pages

4054697 noch vor wenigen jahren war die partnersuche im internet gesellschaftlich noch nicht sehr angesehen
4054698 die suche nach einer neuen liebe im netz wird heute als ganz normale legitime methode angesehen jeder sechste internetnutzer findet inzwischen einen partner im web
4054699 die tendenz ist klar steigend vor einem jahr hatten wir noch 750 000 mitglieder

4054710 this is all borne out of the idea of having faith and belief in humanity
4054711 that morning on 7 july i was saved by many people
4054712 it didnt matter about my faith how much money i had or whether i was male or female i was simply a human being and i think that will always live with me as a great example of having faith in each other

4054738 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body

4054746 os parceiros internacionais n o podem substituir se aos nacionais na constru o do bem comum
4054747 importa louvar o facto de o governo decidir fazer do distrito o p lo de desenvolvimento na verdade no distrito onde vive a maior parte do nosso povo cerca de 80 por cento de um universo de 20 3 milh es de habitantes e l se encontra o grosso das riquezas naturais percebe se que seja o distrito a base do nosso desenvolvimento
4054748 mergulhada em mil e um problemas a pobreza a degrada o dos valores morais e do tecido social a inseguran a corrup o galopante desavergonhada e impune
4054749 partidariza o das institui es do estado pelo partido no poder
4054750 preocupam nos igualmente a coac o de cidad os a pertencer ao partido frelimo isto uma viola o dos direitos humanos e lesivo para a democracia e a paz
4054751 afirmar a invers o de prioridades de modo que a vida seja colocada acima do mercado do lucro do capital e ao mesmo tempo colocar na agenda dos debates nacionais a preocupa o da vida
4054752 there are about 650 000 acres in the county and half is forest and 128 000 acres are in farmland
4054753 thats a big piece of the county and who we are
4054754 westmoreland county is classified as urban and to still have a fair like we have is a unique opportunity
4054755 a lot of members are doing agriculture projects where its not necessary to live on a farm
4054756 the fair is one of the few places that agriculture has to show its products
4054757 it has always been an important part of the farmers lives
4054758 things like the tractor pulls that are a long tradition going back to the horse pulls are the epitome of the fair experience
4054759 one of the neat things is its multi generational involvement
4054760 it becomes a family tradition and is truly a community in its own right people come together to renew long lasting relationships when they come out to the fair
4054761 we will leave only 10 armed men for each side
4054762 im here because i love china i mean i love the chinese people
4054763 we want to strike hard and rebuild you have got a million and a half people that are homeless they have got several thousands that lost their lives sowe have to resolve that they have not died in vain
4054764 last week when i was training on the mountain three people had to be rescued by paramedics
4054765 this is an opportunity for us to show the true spirit of american people
4054766 weve all got our own philosophies about how a course should play
4054767 and sure everybody thinks it should be set up to please them and their game
4054768 its our job to combine the competition aspect of golf with entertaining the fans
4054769 we need to remember we are in the entertainment business
4054770 whoever thought tiger would hit his drive onto the clubhouse at firestone
4054771 you dont want to get to the weekend and have guys putting on a beaten up part of the green
4054772 its good for the golfers and the fans who want to see different shots
4054773 theyre the ones paying for the tournament and making the whole week possible
4054774 why not let them feel like theyre on top of the action
4054775 its a magnificent course with a lot of possibilities to it
4054776 we want to bring out all those qualities that make it so wonderful
4054777 the initial task will be to generate funds for a legal fund
4054778 in this type they essentially challenge the rationale of the creation of the overlay district and whether it was done for a legitimate purpose
4054779 my experience is that if there is a community group it generally carries more weight
4054780 if we go the distance we would need to generate 4 000 and this would require a tremendous effort and generosity on everybodys part
4054781 she was never without a smile through thick and thin
4054782 she used to tell us not to worry because things would work themselves out no matter how bad they seemed at the time
4054783 i like to say mother led a pretty stress free life
4054784 she had two husbands who worshiped the ground she walked on and she was a wonderful christian woman
4054785 i cant ever remember her being sick a day in her life
4054786 in fact she took care of herself until she was 98 then she went to a home
4054787 she never weighed more than 120 pounds in her life
4054788 even after i made her quit driving she still would go to the womens meetings and always to sunday school because she enjoyed that
4054789 i just started driving her and made sure she got where she wanted to go
4054790 and she always saw that we were involved in that when we were children
4054791 for years she had a nice garden and in her younger years she canned a lot
4054792 any organization that seeks federal funding to perform public health economic or educational development is required to provide demographic analysis on populations within specific geographic areas
4054793 we teach students how to access census data files online and then use the gis to extract specific demographic information and map the results down to the neighborhood level
4054794 the time is right for the world of golf to come together for the common good of the sport
4054795 to reinstate golf as an olympic sport and to the olympic program
4054796 i dont know how youre going to possibly do it in the middle of the most important part of our season
4054797 if golf is going to be in the olympics it should be amateurs playing
4054798 its been made very clear to us on several occasions by the ioc that if golf is to be in the olympics it has to be for the top players in the world
4054799 golf will not get into the olympics if its to be for amateurs
4054800 i think youd have to go tournament like with high school or college teams
4054801 youd have five guys but dont throw out your high score let everybodys score count
4054802 im excited about the way we have it set up now
4054803 with the nordic eco labelled clothes filippa k wants to show the companys long term environmental way of thinking as one of the first nordic clothing brands we make garment with minimum environmental impact throughout all stages of the production process this is a big step in the right direction concerning eco clothes and it is just the beginning of our long term focus on environmentally friendly design
4054804 echt de mooiste dag van ons leven de tv die het liet afweten dat heeft de emoties alleen maar intenser gemaakt
4054805 i was in this small office with a desk a chair a typewriter and a telephone
4054806 and my job was a open a public library in 12 months
4054807 the goals we set 40 years ago have been met and the community still cares so much about the library and we are still busy what more can you ask for
4054808 i remember the first employees saying that at the time they wondered what if no one comes to the library and we end up with a big white elephant
4054809 said joan fancher who lives in ross and has worked at the library for 32 years
4054810 but it didnt take long to answer that question the people came and they have kept coming
4054811 deep down i knew it was going to make it it was going to succeed
4054812 if i thought it would fail i would not have taken the job the key to it was the community was completely behind us
4054813 im just extremely pleased and proud to have played a part in it
4054814 the creation of this library is the closest thing i could have done to giving birth to a baby to me this library was my baby
4054815 this place is my second home and these people are my second family
4054816 i told my children when they started out find a career you wouldnt mind doing 40 years from now and youll be happy im happy
4054817 we are working hard to rebuild our credit in international swimming
4054818 het is een nederlandse man en hij is bekend ik wil niet zeggen wie het is
4054819 ik kan alleen zeggen dat jullie heel veel van mij gaan zien
4054820 iedereen weet dat ik iets met seb godefroid red gehad heb nu ben ik met darren dit was helemaal niet gepland zon dingen gebeuren nu eenmaal daar heb je geen controle over darren en ik zijn beiden echter lang genoeg in het zeilen actief om dit geen invloed te laten hebben op onze relatie hij is bovendien superprofessioneel met zijn sport bezig darren en ik praten nooit over zeilen en in de haven lopen we nooit opzichtig hand in hand als ik tijdens wedstrijden een appartement deel met seb begrijpt darren dat als we met elkaar willen eten ga ik naar darren hij komt niet bij seb en mij langs
4054821 ik moest wel naar de tornado overschakelen omdat de europe gebannen werd
4054822 anders was ik zeker in de europe actief gebleven dat ik een belgisch paspoort moest aannemen om te kunnen deelnemen in de tornado is geen probleem ik ben blij dat ik voor belgi kan zeilen nederland zal ik altijd dankbaar blijven voor de steun die het mij heeft gegeven nederlander belg ik ben het alletwee
4054823 maar ze haten het wel om door een chick verslagen te worden dus duwen ze op het eind altijd iets harder door als ze onze boot zien opdagen niettemin de tornado klasse is n grote familie
4054824 the complaint he made is irrelevant he was fired for being a poor administrator
4054825 a very casual method of officers accounting for the their time
4054826 im also the lowest paid member of the department at 40 000 a year
4054827 we have developed this analysis process and workflow to facilitate the conversion of electoral registers to bs 7666 and their subsequent matching to the nlpg
4054828 the core project for a national online database of electors is directly analogous to the nlpg a national online database of addresses that we as custodians of the nlpg understand extremely well
4054829 in a way the result in hungary was a very important lesson for the team it showed us in no uncertain terms that we cannot afford to be complacent and need to work hard throughout the summer break to make sure we can hit back strongly in valencia
4054830 you can never underestimate a team like ferrari and we know theyll be pushing just as hard as us to gain an advantage for the remainder of the year
4054831 who knows if wed had an easier race in hungary maybe it would have come back and bitten us later in the season so i feel confident that we wont be taking anything for granted
4054832 while these data suggest the development of more favorable patterns of alcohol consumption over the latter part of the 20th century they also show that at the same time the cumulative incidence of alcohol use disorders has not shown a decrease and continuing efforts at preventing them are warranted
4054833 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal
4054834 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4054835 thank goodness some people are seeing the hypocrisy of it all
4054836 i know it makes sienna pleased to read these things
4054837 it means a lot to her when theres so much negativity and criticism around
4054838 jade wasnt sure when she was first approached because she was so worried about how the indian housemates and public might react
4054839 she was really upset about everything that happened after the scandal last year people were burning effigies of her in the street
4054840 but she really wants to clear her name and prove to everyone that shes not a racist

4054849 from a practical business perspective when big companies and their legal teams look at creative commons there are a number of questions
4054850 its been one of the things their legal teams throw at us
4054851 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4054852 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that

4054858 regs death came as a shock to me because we only spoke a couple of weeks back and he sounded as robust as ever he was a lovely man who seemed to have a music library for a brain
4054859 he used to send me records that he knew i would want to hear and we had so many conversations about great songwriters he loved the business and it showed in his endless enthusiasm for quality singers or vintage movies

4054868 its just one of the golf courses ive never seemed to play that well im not a long ball knocker im more straight than long but thats the kind of player it favors
4054869 the federal reserve is freeing up vast amounts of money to help the banks but the fed can only do so much
4054870 too much money pumped into the economy will drive up inflation
4054871 at the same time businesses are finding it harder to borrow which threatens overall economic activity
4054872 financial experts say up to nearly a trillion dollars of debt will eventually be erased from the books as financial institutions around the globe get their balance sheets back in order
4054873 studies show for every dollar lost its 10 to 15 times that amount no longer able to find its way into the marketplace as much needed credit
4054874 well have to watch the track of this storm closely a shift of a hundred miles to the west could throw heavy snow and blustery winds across the big cities of the northeast
4054875 residents should hoist the red and white flag three days before and three days after the independence day
4054876 we have to give the highest appreciation for our independence fought so hardly by our heroes
4054877 i urge residents to report to the officers if there is anybody who did not raise the flag
4054878 with the advent of the bolshevik revolution in 1917 the baldwin locomotive works was forced to stop shipment of more than one hundred 2 10 0 locomotives originally bound for czarist russia
4054879 in the united states the 2 10 0 was not popular but was a favorite of a small number of railroads mostly in mountainous terrain the main advantage was that five out of six of its axles were powered meaning almost all the weight was available for traction rather than being distributed over pilot and trailing wheels the long rigid wheelbase caused problems on tightly curved track so blind drivers were the norm either on the central axle and or on the second and or fourth axles often lateral motion devices were attached to the leading driven axles
4054880 ich bin mir sicher ihr merkt wie sehr die musikindustrie zu k mpfen hat und ich f r meinen teil bin von der musikindustrie als ganzes stark desillusioniert worden es wird immer schwieriger ausreden zu finden warum ich das hier mache

4054884 once you get farther away from 70 percent you get inequity
4054885 the purpose of a revaluation is not to raise taxes the purpose is to create an equitable distribution of the tax load
4054886 i think a lot of people were satisfied with the appraisal actually well at least a few of them
4054887 the basic thing is dont multiply that number by last years tax rate it will be a different one
4054888 its an original ship and represents a time when not only were people fishing but they were racing these schooners and the roseway was one of them
4054889 my kids come into the apartment and they say its damp smelling
4054890 its a little better in the winter when the heats on but its all the time
4054891 i talked with patricia martine the director of the yha several times and she insisted there was no mold
4054892 yes at times they look at me like i dont know what im talking about at times they have not been responsive
4054893 im happy my experience has been nothing but good the office always responds when i call
4054894 this investment into emerging technologies is paying off in delivering state of the art science support
4054895 in the near future sentry will conduct high resolution oceanographic surveys that would be otherwise impossible
4054896 sentry is a true robot functioning on its own in the deep water
4054897 the vehicle is completely on its own from the time it is unplugged on the deck and cut loose in the water
4054898 publishers and bloggers are increasingly looking to introduce social networking capabilities to their sites as they look for ways to increase reader engagement
4054899 are waiting for us to act in a fiscally and morally responsible way
4054900 it was democrats who went on vacation while we have an energy crisis
4054901 most republican candidates have a comprehensive energy plan while democrats say no to everything
4054902 83 percent of americans support a plan to end americas addiction to oil through investment in wind solar and next generation biofuel technology 20 percent more than supported increased offshore drilling eighty percent believe that america should put a stop to billions of dollars in oil subsidies and use the money to invest in renewable sources
4054903 youre waiting around and in that time you couldve gotten something done like walk the dog
4054904 obviously for my job and doctors appointments i go out of my way to be on time
4054905 that way his being late equals him being on time
4054906 and heres the simple fact i got here on time and you can manage to as well
4054907 if its a friend who does this a lot and it really puts you out remind them that your time is just as valuable as theirs
4054908 in new york they wait until the agreed meeting time and then they go were more laid back and tolerate more than we probably should
4054909 if were talking about someone who is chronically late they might be avoiding anxiety or anger or resisting something
4054910 perhaps they are overscheduled and need to say no once in a while
4054911 he always taught me its better to be safe than sorry
4054912 if im late for practice it just stresses me out
4054913 im particularly pleased to be here because elaine krasker is my cousin
4054914 all six girls are exceptional i like them all i love them all
4054915 certain countries go by rules and certain countries do not
4054916 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4054917 look pretty young but i dont look 20 so im not one to judge
4054918 he is just another person but maybe from a different planet
4054919 he cared a lot about education and regardless of what he needed to do he wanted to make sure all of us children went to college he made it happen he pushed us to go and made sure it was paid for if we needed anything he helped as much as he could my dad thought a good education was important regardless of what you ended up doing in life
4054920 i was a junior in high school and i didnt like school
4054921 i didnt want to go but he persuaded me i went for criminal justice im not using it right now but ive got the degree
4054922 he was successful in what he did but he still understood the importance of education
4054923 we were trying to think of a way we could give back to the community
4054924 my mother toni billings does a scholarship there in her brothers name
4054925 its a small school and we grew up in that community my dad tried to give as much there as he could hed do fund raisers and help with sports activities
4054926 he told me to calm down then started hitting me
4054927 the two of them were squared off on the front lawn
4054928 i got calls from bea marconi the town administrator saying people have been wanting to know what they can do to help
4054929 i went to the bank and set up the fund those people deserve something to tide them over until their insurance kicks in
4054930 using the internet to start and grow your small business
4054931 tim needs to go at least six innings brad is a bull he pitched complete games all year for winnacunnet high school and he pitched a big one for us in the state tournament
4054932 if we pitch and play defense like we did in the state tournament well be ok itll depend on how deep our pitching goes
4054933 i need to have him play second base because im not going to dh him for tim or brad when theyre pitching
4054934 jack was a great outfielder in high school but he didnt hit real well
4054935 but coming into legion the kids picked him up and he has responded his offense has been my biggest surprise
4054936 when you go up there its not like they put a number on you saying youre hitting fourth today
4054937 weve known about him as a hitter but now hes added some power
4054938 he comes to play hard he come up with big hits
4054939 youre never going to replace any guy on this team you just try to manage when theyre gone
4054940 last night we were able to make it up but tonight you cant keep expecting to try to make that up
4054941 we made it a little more interesting than we needed to
4054942 obviously were not going to know today or tomorrow the length of the thing well let him get treatment hopefully its quicker than not
4054943 the obvious thing that comes to mind was the hgh thing in the morning that was a really tough day for me
4054944 the other thing was the tough loss with the red sox celebrating on the field we had a 3 1 lead in the series going into the locker room and having grown men crying
4054945 im excited to be going to a team with a lot of pressure the alternative is going to a team where the games dont count im excited i love the pressure i want to pitch in a world series ive never pitched in a world series
4054946 i started praying i wanted to stay in the game

4054954 hey bud whats your fear do you want kids to drink your beer
4054955 he was just spoiling everything he started ripping them off and said we were ruining his property and it was just a big mess
4054956 the whole thing makes the anheuser busch company look totally childish
4054957 our stickers say nothing about the consequences of alcohol they dont say dont buy beer they simply warn parents not to let their underage kids drink alcohol from their home
4054958 so we figure ok anheuser busch is thinking their sales loss will come from not having minors drink your alcohol
4054959 from our perspective it was more of a conversation than a confrontation
4054960 in the heat of the moment they saw people stickering our products in a non uniform way all over the boxes and the bar codes so they may have acted emotionally there and asked them to stop
4054961 their point is this is my property and youre defacing it my point is its just a positive cautionary message and its the store owners property
4054962 we are not opposed to the message the method theyre using is what were not totally in agreement with
4054963 i think there are probably better ways to communicate underage drinking is wrong that are more long term methods
4054964 we feel if it prevents one child from drinking and helps one parent to be aware of the situation then it is positive
4054965 seems that there are more than a couple of folks taking notice of your postings tom excellent job i believe cleveland is better off because of the job you did
4054966 tom blumer at bizzyblog brings actual facts about coal miner fatalities to light and gives the bdsers a reality check
4054967 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
4054968 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
4054969 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
4054970 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
4054971 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
4054972 triangulation was used here to pinpoint the location of ships
4054973 we have a triangulation board one of the few remaining in the country we have been offered money for it the mines were free floating or tethered they could be set off from inside the building
4054974 the topic was law enforcement and police said the biggest problem in new castle was fort stark its dark and isolated we said what can we do to help and decided wed clean it up the following week the first crew showed up including sam jarvis jenny rosenson and david borden we just got started and now i am amazed when i come here each week and see what has been accomplished
4054975 getting rid of oriental bittersweet vine one of the most invasive plants is a challenge it strangles everything especially large beautiful trees the only way is to get in and cut it out its hard difficult dirty sweaty work and volunteers come down two mornings a week weve saved countless pines and some hardwood
4054976 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed
4054977 the declaration fails to adequately address the damage inflicted by the tornado and fails to fully cover those impacted by this disaster which has only been worsened by subsequent rain and flooding
4054978 the severity and breadth of the disaster led governor lynch to request that all five impacted counties be declared disaster areas and that fema provide both public and individual assistance
4054979 ready to work with local state and federal officials in that effort
4054980 boston logan leads the u s in several categories when it comes to improved aviation safety for the traveling public
4054981 pilots like it because they can see the improvements that the massachusetts port authority massport has implemented over the years from better runway signage markings and new runway status lights to more taxiways every project makes a difference
4054982 boston has even delivered several initiatives like the enhanced runway marking and signage project ahead of schedule and gone above and beyond the faa regulations to make its airport safer
4054983 its clear that their management and workers place a high premium on collaboration with all industry representatives to get the job done
4054984 boston logan is deeply honored to receive this award said edward c
4054985 this award not only signifies that the airport gets it when it comes to making pilots key players on our safety team it also represents a strong vote of confidence about the work we do to improve safety
4054986 france may seem as an odd pick in this investment climate but ewq has a number of factors working in its favor says carl delfeld editor of the
4054987 frances president nicolas sarkozy got off to a blundering start but has recently gained some momentum
4054988 recently christine lagarde frances finance minister rammed through a modernization of the economy law which slashes red tape for entrepreneurs and increases competition in the moribund retail sector
4054989 the retirement age is also being raised by a year and companies are to be allowed to negotiate working time directly with employee representatives to permit more than a 35 hour week
4054990 unemployed people who refuse more than two job offers will face penalties another good sign cargo handling is being transferred to the private sector in a sweeping reform of ports a union stronghold
4054991 even if the french economy stagnates its stock market is dominated by leading multinationals able to search for growth around the world
4054992 ten of europes largest 40 multinationals are based in france on our relative valuation tables france is looking good trading at 5 4 times cash flow and 1 54 times book value
4054993 low valuations coupled with policy reforms will attract global equity managers interest
4054994 we feel that our vc relationships have already absorbed and worked through the majority of risks
4054995 ideally we like to invest in companies that are within 36 months of liquidity
4054996 we dont show up like don corleone with luca brasi and put a gun to their heads
4054997 the deal flow is a joke the only reason we get these deals is because we massively overpay
4054998 i ran the best irish pub in barcelona and the best gay bar
4054999 we are working to get concrete information its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information

4055011 as time passed he got tired of traveling so far to see his customers we were just looking for a small house here not a business
4055012 he said it was really run down but the foundation was very solid very good
4055013 strictly an accident we said if were going to be here why not try a b amp b
4055014 so far im having a good time the people staying here have been wonderful its been very pleasant
4055015 when it comes to fashion were too often giving the goods away but my mind can create something so much better than were looking at
4055016 sex sells but it comes and goes sensuality lasts a lifetime
4055017 that kiss scene with burt lancaster left is heralded as one of the most romantic scenes on film ever it was a modest one piece but the scene just oozed sexuality
4055018 it was the first time we saw nipples yet everything was covered
4055019 it looked like it all happened naturally it was all american sexy and fun like something wed never seen before
4055020 when you put a sexy figure in water it adds to the senses
4055021 she was the fantasy of everyone men and women yes the bathing suit was a little too tight but that was the point of the movie the perfect 10 i loved the late 70s
4055022 he told me to calm down then started hitting me
4055023 the two of them were squared off on the front lawn
4055024 she was an outstanding candidate and i know shell be an outstanding coordinator shes enthusiastic and forward thinking im excited shes on board
4055025 i worked for two separate recycling companies friedman recycling in phoenix and e l harvey and sons in massachusetts i sold equipment for four years ive done dispatching and sales i have a lot of experience in customer service
4055026 the first thing is getting familiar with the scale and how things operate
4055027 i have a great team here of four people they kept everything up and running during the interim im happy theyre here i rely on them thats the most important thing having a good team
4055028 thats a good place to start i want to make sure were doing everything possible for the safety of the employees the public that uses the station and the environment id like to visit other transfer stations in the area that have similar characteristics and see what kind of things theyre doing
4055029 the town probably quadruples the amount of waste in the summer
4055030 so its good that i came in at a good time to see it really busy and how much the volume increases in the offseason once things slow down we can look at some of the housekeeping things
4055031 the initial thing is to evaluate the audit and the consultants report
4055032 well look at how we can incorporate some of the things here that have been successful i dont want to make change for the sake of change many things here are working well i want it to be a place where its safe to work and know that were doing the best we can for the town its a work in progress
4055033 if the maximum amount of water allowed had been taken we would have had 900 000 a year in additional revenue
4055034 thats a 16 percent increase for the average residential customer that pays about 300 it would be about a 50 saving
4055035 my kids come into the apartment and they say its damp smelling
4055036 its a little better in the winter when the heats on but its all the time
4055037 i talked with patricia martine the director of the yha several times and she insisted there was no mold
4055038 yes at times they look at me like i dont know what im talking about at times they have not been responsive
4055039 im happy my experience has been nothing but good the office always responds when i call
4055040 once you get farther away from 70 percent you get inequity
4055041 the purpose of a revaluation is not to raise taxes the purpose is to create an equitable distribution of the tax load
4055042 i think a lot of people were satisfied with the appraisal actually well at least a few of them
4055043 the basic thing is dont multiply that number by last years tax rate it will be a different one
4055044 prohibition from child care services of persons convicted of certain offenses

4055046 when adequate parking facilities for the accommodation of traffic have been provided and paid for the rates fees and charges shall be adjusted to provide funds for maintenance and operation only
4055047 when i first eyeballed it the obvious reason for it was that there was a need for towns to spend money on parking lots they floated bonds on them there was only one court case and essentially it said that once youve paid them off you can continue to use the money for maintenance and repair and thats it
4055048 i dont know where this law actually plays into us
4055049 i dont have just one account it cuts across every department budget in some way visitor services the department that staffs the lots is one small piece of the big picture we spent two hours here this morning counting the receipts from the weekend for example its all about the parking lots in the summer
4055050 we have a lot more people coming to our beach and parking than they have which accounts for the increased income
4055051 expenses associated with one year arent necessarily the same as the next
4055052 for example we dont pave the lots every year and the costs cant be limited to just the beach area
4055053 that will affect more users with less of an impact
4055054 were taxing people who actually use more water not just because they have large meters
4055055 we looked at the number of customers affected in selecting a use level
4055056 we chose it based on what an average user would have used this will affect seasonals more we have to build our structure to handle the peak flow
4055057 the trustees felt that was a fairer way to bill
4055058 seeing the ducks cross the bridge is a riot to watch
4055059 once in a while you get a straggler that goes off to the side and you need a kayaker to fish them out
4055060 seeing the ducks cross the bridge is a riot to watch
4055061 once in a while you get a straggler that goes off to the side and you need a kayaker to fish them out

4055063 it was democrats who went on vacation while we have an energy crisis
4055064 most republican candidates have a comprehensive energy plan while democrats say no to everything
4055065 83 percent of americans support a plan to end americas addiction to oil through investment in wind solar and next generation biofuel technology 20 percent more than supported increased offshore drilling eighty percent believe that america should put a stop to billions of dollars in oil subsidies and use the money to invest in renewable sources
4055066 triangulation was used here to pinpoint the location of ships
4055067 we have a triangulation board one of the few remaining in the country we have been offered money for it the mines were free floating or tethered they could be set off from inside the building
4055068 the topic was law enforcement and police said the biggest problem in new castle was fort stark its dark and isolated we said what can we do to help and decided wed clean it up the following week the first crew showed up including sam jarvis jenny rosenson and david borden we just got started and now i am amazed when i come here each week and see what has been accomplished
4055069 getting rid of oriental bittersweet vine one of the most invasive plants is a challenge it strangles everything especially large beautiful trees the only way is to get in and cut it out its hard difficult dirty sweaty work and volunteers come down two mornings a week weve saved countless pines and some hardwood
4055070 mr huang mr liu and mr zhao and have served our company for a long time and we have benefited from their expertise in technology corporate operations administration and management
4055071 as members of our management team they will assist us with the management of more than 700 employees a radical increase from approximately 100 employees in 2006 we are confident that their expertise will ensure efficiency in running our organization as well as in the delivery of solutions to clients
4055072 the 50 50 sounds like a good deal but when you do the numbers its not fair for kennebunk
4055073 its like a compromise between four and five and i can live with that
4055074 we are trying to come up with a plan that all the voters can pass
4055075 i just want to make it clear if we dont come up with some type of terms there is going to be a huge penalty
4055076 he cared a lot about education and regardless of what he needed to do he wanted to make sure all of us children went to college he made it happen he pushed us to go and made sure it was paid for if we needed anything he helped as much as he could my dad thought a good education was important regardless of what you ended up doing in life
4055077 i was a junior in high school and i didnt like school
4055078 i didnt want to go but he persuaded me i went for criminal justice im not using it right now but ive got the degree
4055079 he was successful in what he did but he still understood the importance of education
4055080 we were trying to think of a way we could give back to the community
4055081 my mother toni billings does a scholarship there in her brothers name
4055082 its a small school and we grew up in that community my dad tried to give as much there as he could hed do fund raisers and help with sports activities
4055083 she was a phi beta kappa from boston university and a teacher
4055084 she taught for eight years before she got married shes probably the sole reason i got through high school
4055085 this is one of the best if not the best resources we have
4055086 i want to help out but i also want other people to help out as well this is a school thats affordable education opens your eyes to the world
4055087 its designed to reflect the true cost of providing service to different classes of customers and also to encourage conservation
4055088 in general the cost of service study we performed was the first one weve ever done this one uses modern accounting principles
4055089 residential customers as a class and seasonal customers in particular are causing our seasonal usage peaks
4055090 but residentials that use very little water 50 gallons per day is our new minimum 100 used to be will see a 24 percent decrease a single family home using 500 gallons or more per day will see an increase of five percent or more
4055091 i encourage people to seek alternative water sources for irrigation during peak season
4055092 large commercials will pay more many small commercials will see a significant decrease
4055093 the seasonal accounts have more operating costs because they exacerbate peak demand
4055094 they are also more costly administratively because we have to close them out and then reopen them each year
4055095 only 10 percent of our users will see an increase over 2 percent
4055096 ninety percent were using 250 gallons or less per day the highest increase is about 28 percent for customers that use 1 500 gallons per day
4055097 after the second round of interviews i would hope to be able to make a job offer and negotiate the terms of employment
4055098 its an original ship and represents a time when not only were people fishing but they were racing these schooners and the roseway was one of them
4055099 im particularly pleased to be here because elaine krasker is my cousin
4055100 we came in as the strong team and everyone knew it
4055101 i think it was the best 100 meter run ever in relay
4055102 weve had a great variety of people participate in the olympics over the years
4055103 jerry ashworth was a fantastic runner but was not alone by any stretch
4055104 it just so happened that someone knew about it about 10 years ago and it finally came up in a conversation
4055105 hey bud whats your fear do you want kids to drink your beer
4055106 he was just spoiling everything he started ripping them off and said we were ruining his property and it was just a big mess
4055107 the whole thing makes the anheuser busch company look totally childish
4055108 our stickers say nothing about the consequences of alcohol they dont say dont buy beer they simply warn parents not to let their underage kids drink alcohol from their home
4055109 so we figure ok anheuser busch is thinking their sales loss will come from not having minors drink your alcohol
4055110 from our perspective it was more of a conversation than a confrontation
4055111 in the heat of the moment they saw people stickering our products in a non uniform way all over the boxes and the bar codes so they may have acted emotionally there and asked them to stop
4055112 their point is this is my property and youre defacing it my point is its just a positive cautionary message and its the store owners property
4055113 we are not opposed to the message the method theyre using is what were not totally in agreement with
4055114 i think there are probably better ways to communicate underage drinking is wrong that are more long term methods
4055115 we feel if it prevents one child from drinking and helps one parent to be aware of the situation then it is positive
4055116 jag vill ha kvar herrfotboll i os under 2000 talet har turneringarna ofta varit lysande ett f r vm med ppnare spel

4055120 i dont do a lot for myself id rather be helping others
4055121 you go over to some of the places in africa that we work with and you have people there that are pretty much living in a home made of cardboard or living on a dollar or two a day
4055122 by world standards americans are wealthy and so you go over there and one of the things they have to get used to is that they are almost like superheroes or a walking wallet
4055123 i still kind a think i might be going to college in the fall a lot of my friends are though
4055124 the meeting will help the ratepayers to understand how the process works and what their rights are

4055129 ik ben inclusief een trainingskamp van drie weken al een maand in china
4055130 het is mooi geweest dit waren mijn derde en laatste spelen helaas zat er opnieuw geen medaille in maar ik heb mijn hele leven zonder olympische plak gedaan dat kan ik de rest van mijn leven ook wel aan
4055131 of ik daarna voor de nationale ploeg beschikbaar blijf dat denk ik wel
4055132 cvs now avoids years of new store operating losses that would have been incurred had this same market penetration been achieved through organic growth
4055133 id like to see you write a follow up on who should take advantage of this credit
4055134 being that its a loan it obviously isnt going to be economical for everyone
4055135 i am not in any way struggling to pay my mortgage and i dont have credit card debt
4055136 sure i need a lawn mower and i wouldnt mind the boost in my savings since my down payment wiped me out but is this tax credit really economical if i dont really need the money for anything except immediate gratification
4055137 u s officials have made it known to the president that it is best for him to step down and end this crisis
4055138 its been an incredible 13 years at radio 1 its time to move on but i have some exciting new radio projects to come
4055139 with these new changes i have decided to take this opportunity to move on from my weekly commitment at radio 1 allowing me time to work on other projects that have been put on hold due to my current schedule fire it up
4055140 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
4055141 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4055142 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
4055143 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
4055144 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
4055145 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
4055146 were proud of anyone who has worked on the side of angels in fledgling democracies

4055183 auditory or visual auditory responses in the primary visual cortex are highly probable given the presence of direct projections from the primary auditory cortex
4055184 we looked for modulation of the neuronal visual responses in the primary visual cortex by auditory stimuli in an awake monkey
4055185 our findings show that single neurons from one primary sensory cortex can integrate information from another sensory modality
4055186 our results argue against a strict hierarchical model of sensory integration in the brain and that integration of multiple senses should be added to the list of functions of the primary visual cortex

4055188 wie nie zuvor sind wir f r eine vielzahl von unternehmen gerade damit befasst einerseits das pricing zu optimieren andererseits aber auch die markenst rke auszubauen auf der marktseite der unternehmen sind dies gerade absolute kernthemen
4055189 marke als dominierendes bewusstes entscheidungskriterium hat in nur f nf jahren quer durch alle branchen dramatisch abgenommen
4055190 es berrascht dass die verbraucher selbst bei den eher emotional gekauften modeartikeln immer st rker auf den preis achten
4055191 in besonders hart umk mpften branchen zeigt sich wohin die reise nun auch in anderen m rkten geht beim flugverkehr bei kaffee banken oder telekommunikation berall verlieren diejenigen markenanbieter an boden die sowohl das eigentliche pricing als auch ihre preiskommunikation nicht im griff haben
4055192 wurde fr her berwiegend der markenname als dominierendes kaufkriterium genannt so ist heute immer fter der preis der wichtigste faktor im bewusstsein der menschen
4055193 auch die lufthansa zeigt dass erfolg auch im wettbewerb mit billiganbietern m glich ist verbraucher honorieren es sofort wenn die richtigen tasten auf der marketing klaviatur gegriffen werden und die zielgruppenbezogene preiskommunikation stimmt
4055194 erstens sind markenanbieter damit konfrontiert dass sich neue zielgruppen st rker ber werte und bed rfniswelten bilden und nicht mehr nur ber demografische faktoren wie die h he des einkommens oder das alter
4055195 m ssen neue preismodelle die werte und einstellungen dieser neuen zielgruppen wesentlich intelligenter ansprechen als bisher markenhersteller die ihre preiskommunikation und ihr markenmanagement schlau verbinden werden sich in diesem trend behaupten k nnen

4055209 in memory of brother leon dorsey it is now our position that until race vouchers are received for our peoples foods amp services and reparations with their due interest are restituted that we will celebrate all atrocities committed against whites that were done to our ancestors in slavery

4055211 walgreens is in our communities charging our people the same prices for their worthless trinkets they charge the white people in who live in the suburbs and gated communities

4055235 we are pleased to report a record quarter for synerons revenues syneron continues to grow sales as a result of the superiority of elos technology as well as our strategic decision to focus marketing and r amp d resources on the key growth segments of aesthetic medicine of body shaping and skin rejuvenation
4055236 the recently launched lipolite has received positive acceptance among the surgical and general medical community
4055237 we started delivering the first units at the end of the second quarter and we expect to start selling significantly during this third quarter in addition we also started implementing our lipolite energy access program leap that was designed with a cost effective annual subscription fee to enable physicians of all specialties to offer the increasingly popular laser assisted lipolysis treatment doctors who had been considering the introduction of laser assisted lipolysis view syneron as a partner who is willing to align itself with them
4055238 with the introduction of leap as well as the introduction of a disposable element to our new matrix rf for which fda approval is pending management has taken another step towards the goal of achieving diversification of our revenues one of the key strategic initiatives we started last year synerons evolving technologies will allow us to diversify our business model in which alongside equipment sales we will begin to benefit from a regular annuity element in our revenues

4055241 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
4055242 think about it if you know about a malicious piece of software that invades your privacy how irresponsible is it to let the application continue to run
4055243 either it is an anti malware solution and has a switch somewhere to vaporise any app or its not an anti malware solution and is really designed to kill applications that interfere with apples business model
4055244 software running on another computer which inspects network traffic passing through it and denies or permits passage based on a set of rules
4055245 although rick warrens primary calling is to proclaim the gospel truth of salvation in jesus christ he created the civil forums to further three additional life goals helping people accept responsibility helping the church regain credibility and encouraging our society to return to civility

4055251 chinese artists who were working overseas have started to move back to china and hope to get more attention during the olympics
4055252 by 2000 people began to realize that there was not that much art available from the 1980s and 1990s so the value would be important and we saw many new collectors
4055253 the district has become a fashionable spot with a fake art feel

4055255 the relief and rehabilitation process might take longer than the security operations
4055256 our army engineers are ready to help in the rehabilitation efforts including in rebuilding hundreds of houses destroyed and damaged during the conflict
4055257 the next task would be to help civilian agencies in handling the displaced people
4055258 the security situation has improved but it will probably take a bit of time before people feel secure enough to return home en masse

4055264 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4055265 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
4055266 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4055267 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
4055268 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
4055269 americans respect your courageous choice for liberty and as you build a free and democratic georgia the american people will stand with you

4055301 speculation in the industry suggests that the sudden capitulation points to the possibility of a merger between shell and another major petrol brand
4055302 this has been an on going saga for so long now one could reasonably assume that the action had become a fly in the ointment for any potential deal from the language of the statements it does seem that shell has wanted to draw a line under this action and secure the future of smart this could now pave the way for a merger and texaco would be the likely candidate
4055303 shells proposed merger with texaco was halted last year uncertainty over the long term legal ownership of the smart concept would certainly be a barrier to such a deal

4055341 travelling around is costing more with the rising petrol costs so my drivers are not keen to do the long distance jobs
4055342 we cant really put our prices up because we might lose clients and we cant pay people more because we wont make any money weve been in business for about 11 years so weve got a large client base
4055343 this time of the year is normally a little slower as people are away but our business is always up and down
4055344 its more of a luxury item and a lot of people cut out their luxury items at times like this but for others who dont have other things to spend their money on maybe its a necessity
4055345 ive found business has been slowly drying up over the last two years to the point where we were just about making our money back
4055346 its just the market nothing other than that weve got our regular customers who are happy with us some of whom come from abroad but people just dont seem to have the dough
4055347 when it was good we had about five or six hotel jobs a week and a couple of home clients it got to the point where we werent getting any hotel work for a month you can tell from the hotel work whether the markets dying or not type the characters you see in the picture above
4055348 there has been a definite upturn in uk domestic travel i think one of the reasons for that is the disappointing exchange rate but i believe another reason is people are finding it generally easier to organise trips in the uk than abroad
4055349 whereas we have spent so much time going abroad over the last few years people are now wanting to return to their own culture this makes particular sense with the credit crunch coming in
4055350 rather than taking two or three holidays a year they are just doing one but making it interesting
4055351 some people are taking the whole family away including the grandparents and staying self catering in a villa because this is a much cheaper way of travelling
4055352 the euro is just too expensive were finding america is attractive because the dollar is good to the pound while the middle east and dubai are very strong for a similar reason

4055355 i am pleased to be able to show my support for gill and the walk talk initiative and to join all those involved who wish to make our society one that embraces peaceful discussion community safety and tolerance
4055356 this is all borne out of the idea of having faith and belief in humanity
4055357 that morning on 7 july i was saved by many people
4055358 it didnt matter about my faith how much money i had or whether i was male or female i was simply a human being and i think that will always live with me as a great example of having faith in each other

4055418 i have to be at work at 8 a m if i have to take my children to different day care centers ill be late for work every day
4055419 we dont have any idea what will be happening in a few weeks
4055420 while we have transported students around the district in the past without regard to home school this has changed this school year as we attempt to more effectively and efficiently utilize our transportation resources the board continues to look at the day care issue to determine the best way to balance parents needs and the districts resources
4055421 i think that somewhere out there theres a solution thats just waiting to be found
4055422 its a compromise of some sort between the developers and the citizens what we perceive to be useful development as opposed to big box stores i would urge the council to take a little bit of time lets find that solution thats out there
4055423 you are in a very small group of vocal citizens against development
4055424 it is also very obvious that the group opposing this ordinance does not represent the future of murrysville by gauging the age of the attendees
4055425 wait and see i bet you will be doing more shopping in murrysville soon and enjoying it thank you for your input
4055426 a majority of the people youve heard speak against the overlay ordinance are not against development that may be something you feel we are against in total but that is not quite true
4055427 i think that theres been a misconception as to the amount of development i think that at least what weve seen proposed is an upscale shopping district with one anchor i dont feel that big boxes are going to be taking over murrysville
4055428 theres only two of our council members who pay any attention to the public
4055429 it was said to be a done deal a year ago and apparently it was they just basically ignored us for eight months
4055430 feel like it i was reminded that there may be one person that can be helped by the content on this blog i realized that there may be one person that can develop a different view of people with disabilities just because they have read through the entries on nuvision

4055432 how do we educate a child who comes in with a myriad of problems from period one

4055434 the rigor associated with pre k counts standards will help them while they transition into kindergarten that helps when they go into pssas
4055435 we wanted to up the ante for wilkinsburg kids and set standards so that kids can get a head start
4055436 theyve been totally committed to the idea of pre k counts in the district and that made our jobs easier
4055437 weve had very good cooperation with teaching staff school board and administration without that collaboration none of this would be possible
4055438 bour associates is no stranger to monroeville or pittsburgh as they provided the event planning and coordination for celebrate monroeville and have worked in the pittsburgh region on such projects as bassmasters the pittsburgh 250 celebration and the 2008 head of the ohio regatta
4055439 their expertise in managing successful events and conferences will be invaluable to the clientele of the cvb
4055440 it was strongly suggested by the council representative that given financial irregularities that apparently are over there it might be a good thing for a new board to be seated
4055441 the conventions and events currently scheduled for monroeville will be fully supported by the cvb and the interim management team

4055455 there was nothing either extraordinary or strange in a man calling at his friends house at half past nine to find out the details of a dinner that was being planned and not coming in but they all thought it strange to anna especially it seemed strange and not right
4055456 in her bare shoulders and arms she felt a cold marble like quality that she especially liked her eyes shone and her red lips could not help smiling from the sense of her own attractiveness
4055457 her loveliness consisted precisely in always standing out from what she wore that what she wore was never seen on her and the black dress with luxurious lace was not seen on her it was just a frame and only she was seen simple natural graceful and at the same time gay and animated
4055458 it was not a painting but a lovely living woman with dark curly hair bare shoulders and arms and a pensive half smile on her lips covered with tender down looking at him triumphantly and tenderly with troubling eyes only because she was not alive she was more beautiful than a living woman can be
4055459 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
4055460 he knew that everything that went in there was beautiful and he was in love precisely with the mysteriousness of it all
4055461 it was if there was some falseness not in him he was very simple and nice but in herself while with levin she felt completely simple and clear but on the other hand the moment she thought of future with vronsky the most brilliantly happy prospects rose before her while with levin the future seemed cloudy

4055472 not a single leaf or blade of grass stirred the scent of the lilac and birdcherry was so strong in the garden and veranda that it seemed as if all the air was in flower it came in wafts now stronger and now weaker till one longed to shut both eyes and ears and drink in that frangrance only
4055473 the frogs making the most of their time before the rain drove them into the pond
4055474 i could hear them flitting restlessly from bush to bush again this spring nightingale had tried to build in a bush under the window and i heard her fly off across the avenue when i went into the veranda she too was expecting rain
4055475 nightingales and frogs were both dumb only the high note of the falling water still went on and a bird which must have sheltered amoung the dry leaves near the veranda steadily repeated its two unvarying notes

4055479 het wordt door internet steeds gemakkelijker om een groot professioneel netwerk te onderhouden dit netwerk heeft waarde in allerlei markten ook in de arbeidsmarkt vriendendiensten bestaan al lang maar door internet wordt hun aantal veel groter een goede verkoper solliciteert meestal niet maar wordt benaderd voor nieuwe uitdagingen deze trend gaat ook steeds meer op bij andere functiegebieden zoals marketing communicatie ict en consultancy sommige bedrijven halen al meer dan 30 van hun nieuwe medewerkers uit het eigen netwerk dit zijn dus mensen die via via op een functie worden aangenomen als je weet dat een goede bekende misschien ook wel eens wat anders wil en je tips hem of haar over een voor hem of haar leuke job dan kan hij of zij van passief werkzoekende ineens actief werkzoekend worden dit is het grootste voordeel van social recruitment ten opzichte van traditionele vacaturebanken waar alleen mensen komen die al actief naar werk op zoek zijn en in de huidige krappe arbeidsmarkt zijn sowieso niet zoveel mensen actief op zoek het verschil met een werving amp selectiebureau is dat een werkgever voor veel lagere kosten kan werven de hoogte van de premie bepaalt het bedrijf helemaal zelf het bedrijf zal nog wel de selectie zelf moeten doen gespecialiseerde werving amp selectiebureaus kunnen friendhunter ook gebruiken voor leadgeneratie en vervolgens voor hun klanten alsnog de selectie van de geschikte kandidaat voor hun rekening nemen ik verwacht dat 2008 het jaar wordt van de doorbraak van social recruitment in nederland in belgi zijn inmiddels succesvolle initiatieven gestart wat friendhunter anders doet dan haar nederlandse en internationale concurrenten is nadrukkelijk samenwerken met partners voor de distributie van vacatures met partners als dagbanen startlog en professionele weblogs zoals marketingfacts en frankwatching kunnen vacatures getarget worden tot in de haarvaten van de arbeidsmarkt
4055480 bedrijven kunnen zich kosteloos registreren op friendhunter en als ze akkoord gaan met de algemene voorwaarden meteen vacatures plaatsen netwerkers kunnen een zoekprofiel aanmaken waardoor niet alle vacatures worden doorgestuurd maar alleen de selectie die zij interessant en relevant vinden friendhunter heeft een uitgebreide e mail rss ondersteuning die je zelf kunt instellen waardoor netwerkers alerts krijgen van relevante vacatures en van de status van hun bemiddelingen bovendien kunnen netwerkers een widget aanmaken voor op de eigen website of weblog friendhunter stap voor stap uitgelegd recruiters worden op de hoogte gehouden als kandidaten zich aanmelden als een kandidaat in het proces zit ontvangt de recruiter berichten met de vraag naar de status van de kandidaat in het sollicitatieproces vanuit de e mail kan de status meteen worden veranderd zodat de recruiter niet zelf hoeft te bewaken dat hij naar de website moet om wijzigingen door te voeren zodra er een match is ontvangt het bedrijf een betalingsopdracht en wordt de netwerker op de hoogte gesteld dat hij of zij 50 van de premie zal ontvangen bij de start van de nieuwe baan van zijn of haar relatie de andere 50 wordt overgemaakt als de medewerker na n maand nog steeds bij het bedrijf werkt de inkomsten zal de netwerker zelf moeten aangeven voor de inkomstenbelastingen voor bedrijven is van belang dat de belastingdienst heeft bevestigd dat ze zich geen zorgen hoeven te maken dat de betalingen aan netwerkers worden gezien als loon uit werken
4055481 een eerste groep bedrijven kreeg in de afgelopen weken al de mogelijkheid om een account aan te maken en vacatures in te voeren vanaf vandaag komt friendhunter ook beschikbaar voor netwerkers de komende weken sluiten verschillende partners zich aan waardoor het bereik direct vergroot wordt door deze aanpak worden adverteerders uit verschillende branches gekoppeld aan een uiteenlopende verzameling netwerken en netwerkers friendhunter kan doordat sollicitatieprocessen via de database worden gemonitord een uitstekende benchmark opbouwen als het gaat om vragen als hoeveel procent van de vacatures worden vervuld welke functies krijgen de meeste kandidaten en hoe lang loopt een sollicitatietraject

4055628 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4055629 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4055630 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4055631 saya kecewa karena terlalu berlarut larut masalahnya seharusnya prosesnya bisa lebih cepat
4055632 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4055633 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4055634 the proliferation of issue ads by defining as electioneering communications broadcast ads that name a federal candidate within 30 days of a primary or caucus or 60 days of a general election and prohibiting any such ad paid for by a corporation including non profit issue organizations such as right to life or the environmental defense fund or paid for by an unincorporated entity using any corporate or union funds

4055638 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4055639 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4055665 our family and hibs football club go way back as my uncle was tom hart chairman of the club in the late 1970s
4055666 what caused this to happen and can this be prevented
4055667 initiate studies on at least five environmental factors identified in the recommendations from the 2007 iom report autism and the environment challenges and opportunities for research as potential causes of asd by 2010
4055668 parents of autistic children and other advocates were mindful of a re election campaign promise to eliminate mercury based compounds from vaccines
4055669 dr harvey fineberg president of the institute of medicine joined mark blaxill kelli ann davis jim moody and me to discuss the ioms studies of vaccine safety and related activities out of that meeting arose the notion that some sort of iom anchored autism oriented event could make a uniquely important contribution to shaping the research agenda against this dreaded disease
4055670 although the workshop is not intended to reprise the analysis of the epidemiological evidence related to vaccine safety the planning committee recognized that vaccine constituents especially organic chemicals used as preservatives or adjuvants obviously qualify as environmental agents that warrant attention in other words our research agenda should include studies of any and all environmental agents that plausibly might contribute to causing or exacerbating autism irrespective of the medium of exposure
4055671 this workshop was an important milestone in the development of a research agenda to examine the potential impact of the environment in the development and progression of autism but it is only a beginning as various actors move forward in developing and implementing the research agenda we urge that all stakeholders be included in all critical discussions although many scientific opportunities and aspects of autism and its cause were discussed we consider the iom workshop to have been a significant testimony to the concept of full public engagement and recommend it as a model to others

4055687 the boy ran into the road without looking and was hit by the truck the boy was lucky to have only sustained some minor bruises and abrasions
4055688 it was ricky januarie who helped make history in the house of pain
4055689 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf
4055690 in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting lineup
4055691 conrad jantjes is on present form the no 1 fullback it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone montgomery his 100th test cap
4055692 this creates questions about where we are heading i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
4055693 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of
4055694 it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
4055695 we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011
4055696 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone he de villiers should be reminded of his mandate its not all about transformation but it is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
4055697 he de villiers should be reminded of his mandate and it was time to see the coachs initial thinking being realised on the field
4055698 one has to be pragmatic in his position as the coach of the national rugby team
4055699 peter has shown that he is wholly committed to the process of transformation and if he decides on a certain permutation for a specific match one cannot then question his commitment
4055700 weve seen since the outset of peters tenure as the national coach that he has created a climate on the rugby landscape for black talents to develop and one just has to recall who was included in his first springbok training group
4055701 after a few months now peter has significantly increased the pool of black talent that can do south african rugby proud and his efforts must be commended
4055702 peter has the delicate task of balancing results and transformation and no one can fault him on this score
4055703 its never easy in the context of sa sport but hes guided the springbok team to a rare victory at carisbrooks house of pain something none of his predecessors have been able to do
4055704 i sincerely hope that the south african public throw their weight behind the boks and that there will be overwhelming support for de villiers and his side at newlands on saturday
4055705 the direction that de villiers has been taking will ensure that rugby will thrive in this country and it is only a matter of time before well have a situation where the black representative in the springbok side will increase significantly
4055706 one has to bear in mind that each game has specific needs and by selecting those players peter has gone about his business by just applying common sense
4055707 when the four players went on stage the roar just about carried to auckland
4055708 although these reports were informal we could not simply ignore them so we had to do our own medical investigation on him
4055709 the reports were conclusively clear that bebe should not be involved in a physical confrontation be it a sparring session or anything
4055710 she was never without a smile through thick and thin
4055711 she used to tell us not to worry because things would work themselves out no matter how bad they seemed at the time
4055712 i like to say mother led a pretty stress free life
4055713 she had two husbands who worshiped the ground she walked on and she was a wonderful christian woman
4055714 i cant ever remember her being sick a day in her life
4055715 in fact she took care of herself until she was 98 then she went to a home
4055716 she never weighed more than 120 pounds in her life
4055717 even after i made her quit driving she still would go to the womens meetings and always to sunday school because she enjoyed that
4055718 i just started driving her and made sure she got where she wanted to go
4055719 and she always saw that we were involved in that when we were children
4055720 for years she had a nice garden and in her younger years she canned a lot

4055725 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4055726 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4055727 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4055728 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4055729 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4055730 that does entirely depend upon the level of clearance basic clearance isnt but higher levels are

4055734 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
4055735 these findings raise the possibility that alzheimers disease may contribute to frailty or that frailty and alzheimers disease share a common cause
4055736 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimer s disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
4055737 this study really ties together two very common syndromes in aging cognitive processes and motor skills in ways i have not seen them connected before
4055738 the ability to perform cutting edge research at a fast pace is crucial to the continued development of new products and technology across our state
4055739 the supercomputer is an invaluable resource for our local businesses and universities i applaud cio oft nystar and rensselaer polytechnic for working with public and private researchers across the state to take advantage of this significant technology
4055740 the world is taking notice of the emergence of supercomputers in new york and our states burgeoning high tech economy
4055741 the research and development that takes place on this high powered computer will have significant implications for medical agricultural economic social programs and public policies state agencies will be able to use the supercomputer to solve complex problems in public safety cyber security education transportation health or human services to name just a few and at no cost through this historic partnership with nystar rensselaer and ibm new york will be at the forefront of innovation
4055742 ccni is a wonderful example of how collaboration and joint investments between higher education government and industry are building an innovation economy in new york ccni will hasten scientific advances by extending human insight and discovery through the use of supercomputing technologies
4055743 the ability to create and run massive data rich models and simulations is crucial for advancing countless academic pursuits and industrial endeavors from developing new advanced materials to understanding in more detail the physical and life sciences and is growing more critical every year
4055744 ccni and other supercomputing systems are shrinking the time required to perform and analyze these massive simulations and computations which in turn is accelerating innovation across all spectrums of research and product development
4055745 as we strive for an outcome based service delivery approach to assist low income new yorkers in achieving economic security and self sufficiency having access to analytical tools and computing resources is a key element for success ccni presents a unique opportunity for otda and other state agencies to make policy changes that will enhance program performance accuracy and integrity by mining billions of data records at an unprecedented speed

4055769 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed
4055770 the declaration fails to adequately address the damage inflicted by the tornado and fails to fully cover those impacted by this disaster which has only been worsened by subsequent rain and flooding
4055771 the severity and breadth of the disaster led governor lynch to request that all five impacted counties be declared disaster areas and that fema provide both public and individual assistance

4055831 the federal reserve is freeing up vast amounts of money to help the banks but the fed can only do so much
4055832 too much money pumped into the economy will drive up inflation

4055854 i got a job here as a salesperson and soon became the manager its a dream job
4055855 bill is just great and figured out to buy directly from our sources
4055856 this is why our prices are so reasonable and also why we have the most incredible and unique merchandise
4055857 we sell so many things to the students as well as to others who are furnishing a summer place or want a quick change
4055858 all ages do shop here despite what some people think
4055859 you really just have to come in and spend some time looking around
4055860 lots of people just think we sell indian clothing for students but we sell much more than this
4055861 these jackets are so reasonably priced and we sell them to all ages of women they just love the quality and the fact they are unique you wont see too many other people wearing what we sell
4055862 it really makes a difference that we are part of the community
4055863 i love it when our regulars come in and hang out you have to as we have so much to see
4055864 boston logan leads the u s in several categories when it comes to improved aviation safety for the traveling public
4055865 pilots like it because they can see the improvements that the massachusetts port authority massport has implemented over the years from better runway signage markings and new runway status lights to more taxiways every project makes a difference
4055866 boston has even delivered several initiatives like the enhanced runway marking and signage project ahead of schedule and gone above and beyond the faa regulations to make its airport safer
4055867 its clear that their management and workers place a high premium on collaboration with all industry representatives to get the job done
4055868 boston logan is deeply honored to receive this award said edward c
4055869 this award not only signifies that the airport gets it when it comes to making pilots key players on our safety team it also represents a strong vote of confidence about the work we do to improve safety

4055871 hey bud whats your fear do you want kids to drink your beer
4055872 he was just spoiling everything he started ripping them off and said we were ruining his property and it was just a big mess
4055873 the whole thing makes the anheuser busch company look totally childish
4055874 our stickers say nothing about the consequences of alcohol they dont say dont buy beer they simply warn parents not to let their underage kids drink alcohol from their home
4055875 so we figure ok anheuser busch is thinking their sales loss will come from not having minors drink your alcohol
4055876 from our perspective it was more of a conversation than a confrontation
4055877 in the heat of the moment they saw people stickering our products in a non uniform way all over the boxes and the bar codes so they may have acted emotionally there and asked them to stop
4055878 their point is this is my property and youre defacing it my point is its just a positive cautionary message and its the store owners property
4055879 we are not opposed to the message the method theyre using is what were not totally in agreement with
4055880 i think there are probably better ways to communicate underage drinking is wrong that are more long term methods
4055881 we feel if it prevents one child from drinking and helps one parent to be aware of the situation then it is positive

4055917 esta bien es mentira pero nos hace bien a los dos
4055918 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4055919 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4055920 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4055921 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4055922 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4055923 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4055924 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4055925 you do not seem to be grasping the point of the jinx
4055926 if were gonna make this work you gotta let me inside even though it hurts dont hide the broken parts that i need to see
4055927 like it or not its the way its gotta be you gotta love yourself if you can ever love me

4055932 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4055933 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4055934 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4055935 nel periodo premestruale si possono manifestare anche effetti positivi come laumento del desiderio sessuale
4055936 lo sai che un impacco freddo sugli occhi d sollievo al mal di testa da sindrome premestruale
4055937 le quattro fasi lunari sono state spesso collegate alle quattro fasi del ciclo femminile
4055938 lo sai che durante il ciclo mestruale consigliabile indossare indumenti comodi e traspiranti
4055939 lo sai che mangiare frutta e cibi integrali aiuta a combattere la stitichezza che colpisce molte donne durante il ciclo
4055940 lo sai che la sindrome premestruale colpisce maggiormente le donne che lavorano fuori casa
4055941 lo sai che la sindrome premestruale non deriva solo da fattori biologici ma anche psicologici e sociali
4055942 unaccurata e corretta igiene genitale indispensabile durante il ciclo mestruale
4055943 non fate giardinaggio durante il ciclo senn vi si seccano i gerani
4055944 non preparate laragosta in bellavista perch la maionese impazzisce e poi dovete buttare tutto nel cesso
4055945 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4055946 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4055947 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4055948 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4055949 i will try and do everything possible to get this resolved
4055950 it is what chelsea and peter kenyon want but there is no way they will pay what madrid want
4055951 the money madrid are asking for is exaggerated in todays market
4055952 para aqu l que quiera escribir sobre turismo lo m s dif cil es su definici n
4055953 el 1963 la uni n internacional de organizaciones oficiales de turismo uioot acopiaba este mismo umbral temporal que ha perdurado en las definiciones propuestas por la omt
4055954 la propuesta de mitchell plantea serios problemas metodol gicos puesto que por ejemplo el turismo residencial de las localidades m s septentrionales se compone en parte de visitantes de localidades pr ximas
4055955 de hecho este criterio ya estaba presente en las definiciones de textos cl sicos como los de hunzinker y krapf en 1942 otros autores en cambio como smith michaud o fernandez fuster por citar tres ejemplos pretenden obviar las motivaciones como factor de definici n del turismo

4055959 100 reasons to go on a road trip across america
4055960 for that is what she had made of me and the mould once set was firm and unchangeable i experienced no desire to possess nor to mould in my own likeness another woman
4055961 had she not made me commit murder for her i nurtured the memory with as much loving care as a poet gives to his creation i worshipped her i imagined myself prostrate before her i buried my head between her soft thighs knowing their strength i asked her to judge me to control me to administer my punishment i loved her called to her in my dreams that i would kill my uncle all over again she had to exist she could not be dead or worse grown weak and as insipid as the women i met at college that would be a betrayal men have destroyed gods for less
4055962 she was looking at me as a rabbit watches a snake
4055963 something stirred in me i knew that i had to act now or not at all coldly with calculation i slapped her across the face
4055964 i was now ready to act at every moment in accordance with a new attitude she had loved inez i had thought about that night after night as i waited to slay him
4055965 my act of slapping her across the face had the effect of annihilating the past of reversing the relation between us
4055966 the fear was still there but it had undergone a subtle modulation it was no longer stark panic and all hatred had gone from her eyes it was as though she were waiting for me to act again
4055967 slowly holding her gaze i bared myself and as i did so i felt the sluice of urgent blood move to harden my member i looked i climbed onto the bed beside her kneeling there slowly an inch at a time i brought it toward her face she stared at it her whole attention riveted upon it and then suddenly when it was no more than six inches from her she let out a small whimper enclosed it like a valuable object in both hands and took it into her mouth as she did her liquid eyes closed and i felt the warmth of complete envelopment her full lips pressed to my hard flesh sliding up and down it her tongue twisting madly around the swollen head she held onto the base of my sex with her hands squeezing hard i was on the verge of annihilation
4055968 each girl picked up a skeleton the fantasy began i was conscious at once of the fact that the bones had been wired together and that fixed firmly to each skeleton was a rubber penis carefully in a practiced way each girl slipped it into her draped the arms of a skeleton over her back and shoulders and lay down on the filthy straw to see a skeleton pricking a young girl the bones bouncing like a beaded parrot cage on her soft belly is a strange sight it did not last long i had the impression that kirstin was impatient for her little insects to become stuck in her web she said something and the girls rose immediately allowing the skeletons to tumble onto the floor they began to fly again or rather to make the motions of flying mona was more graceful than milly her movements were less abrupt and the flesh of her buttocks was a startling white against her red hair
4055969 here at last was the risk that i was looking for the intensity the obscenity the criminality to which i could bring the willing consent of my own body and soul the vision of anna paled before the image of kirstin the one wished nothing more than to be a victim the other would dare to victimize what hellish green fires must have burned within kirstin to turn her into the woman beast i had seen in action i had to make a compact at once i would wait an hour then the orgy surely would be over and then i would ring for her for the first time in my life i had met a woman to whom i could dedicate myself utterly the old craving to be the instrument of anothers will surged up in me anew kirstin kirstin faust is waiting for you
4055970 in only a few days time kirstin had made me the doting slave of her body and her will kirstin now slept with me every night or rather i slept with her for it was she who had become pre eminent and it was i who nightly slept with my head between the wet weight of her thighs it was she who insisted upon this and i loved and worshipped her for it deriving more pleasure from my utter abasement than i had ever drawn from abasing another
4055971 she lay with her hands to her sides as if her palms were nailed to the floor and looked ceilingward
4055972 i kneeled up to remove myself from the hideous yet lovely sight of her furtive meaning she looked at me my body kneeling before her
4055973 obediently i did as i was told as my tongue came out to meet the mixture of our fluids i realized the gravity of my actions for then intoxicated by her heavy sweet fragrance i was committing sacrilege worshipping a new god she clamped my head between her flawlessly white thighs the tender flesh of them burning my cheeks my ears suffocating me and cutting off all sound it was then as i swirled in the thick eddy of her release that i gleaned the future i would have to prove my devotion to her there would have to be a sacrifice
4055974 part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups hispanics in particular
4055975 those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age
4055976 i like vending machines because snacks are better when they fall if i buy a candy bar at the store oftentimes i will drop it so that is achieves its maximum flavor potential
4055977 we are always going to be a side thats going to be a little bit patchy because kids give you those inconsistencies
4055978 weve been very fortunate to have two or three very good senior players hold their consistency and im talking about shane wakelin and scott burns who are our oldest players
4055979 but then youve got jack anthony nathan brown john mccarthy chris dawes tyson goldsack sharrod wellingham
4055980 what are you going to get i want to have an enthusiastic group play good football but they are kids and they will be like that when youve got the inconsistency of youth you put up with it
4055981 its exciting its fantastic when you win i dont blame youth for losing but the inconsistency is sometimes a factor
4055982 you cant manufacture anything more than that finals are one of the greatest carrots in front of anyone and obviously collingwood have got it this week and for our guys its going to be motivationally very difficult
4055983 we did the right thing and the best thing for our club moving forward and thats as bad as it might seem the no
4055984 its very important that that part of the world keeps playing cricket
4055985 obviously those countries are struggling but if it doesnt happen i hope they do whatever they need to rectify the situation
4055986 i really cant say until i hear from aca and cricket australia
4055987 once again im going to have to look at that report and see what it says i cant commit either way at the moment
4055988 if we do go itll be on the basis of that all has been taken care of and that unease factor will hopefully be removed

4056032 as vemos que desde la plaza de la libertad el destino m s frecuente es la plaza de la pescader a los usuarios que cogen una bicicleta en la plaza de la pescader a se dirigen principalmente a la estaci n de renfe en el grao el punto de pr stamos es el principal origen y destino en el caso de la uji comparten importancia la estaci n de renfe y la plaza de la pescader a y finalmente desde el hospital general el trayecto m s repetido es el que lleva a renfe
4056033 los usuarios del servicio bicicas hacen un uso cotidiano del pr stamo ya sea para acudir al centro de la ciudad por motivos laborales o en la zona de la uji donde cada vez son m s los estudiantes que lo utilizan para acceder o abandonar el campus universitario
4056034 la complementariedad que representa el pr stamo de bicicletas para aquellos que utilizan el tren para desplazarse a castell n ya que una vez en la estaci n y gracias al plan de ciclabilidad resulta c modo y r pido llegar al centro de la ciudad

4056037 no es algo que pueda sorprender excesivamente y que se esconde detr s del argumento tan manido del d ficit h drico del levante espa ol
4056038 compartimos con otros colectivos y organizaciones de nuestra regi n el considerar que el ministerio y por ende el gobierno del sr zapatero sigue barajando pol ticas insostenibles en materia de agua muy alejadas de lo que venimos defendiendo como nueva cultura del agua que pase por valorar el agua como recurso social y ecol gico y que implica un profundo cambio tico con relaci n a las generaciones futuras y al entorno natural
4056039 lamentablemente somos testigos de c mo el tema del agua genera grandes pol micas y abundantes dosis de demagogia tanto por el pp como el psoe y los respectivos gobiernos auton micos implicados como es el caso del de castilla la mancha cuando realmente la pol tica h drica e hidr ulica en nuestro pa s ha cambiado muy poco a pesar de los cambios de color en el gobierno central
4056040 no cuenta con ninguna racionalidad hidr ulica econ mica y ecol gica pero sin embargo si tienen garant a jur dica mientras no se cambien sus normas de explotaci n que es lo que permite al gobierno central aprobar trasvases continuamente
4056041 artists use frauds to make human beings seem more wonderful than they really are dancers show us human beings who move much more gracefully than human beings really move films and books and plays show us people talking much more entertainingly than people really talk make paltry human enterprises seem important singers and musicians show us human beings making sounds far more lovely than human beings really make architects give us temples in which something marvelous is obviously going on actually practically nothing is going on

4056053 i congratulate him and wish him well with his award
4056054 he did it all for his electorate and he believed that was his role to represent his constituents and i think he did that in a very honourable and efficient way

4056068 for n90s mb 10 provides a vertical hand grip a secondary fully functional shutter release with a lock a different but quicker way for battery loading and the possibility to use cr123 type lithium batteries with optional battery tray ms 11 beside the battery tray ms 10 which comes with mb 10 spares can also be purchased this is an impressively hefty and solid piece of plastic it weighs 7 4 oz 210g without batteries the mb 10 is connected to the camera physically via the tripod socket and electronically via the contacts surrounding the cameras battery chamber which include 3 contacts for shutter release button 2 contacts for power source and a hidden power switch the mb 10 uses the battery chamber of the camera body just to reach the electrical contacts i guess and provides its own battery chamber loading batteries into the mb 10 is simple and quick at a press of a button the battery holder is ejected after loading or replacing with a back up battery tray pushing the tray back in and you are ready to go no fiddling with the small screw or emptying all your pockets to find a penny i found that with mb 10 attached my confidence in hand holding shots is substantially boosted i shot an intercollegiate fashion show lately the lighting is not very bright i used sb 26 and my favorite nikkor 80 200 2 8 zoom the shutter was at 1 30 second the lowest normal sync speed of my customized n90 at f 2 8 this gives about 1 stop underexposure if shot with ambient light only i wanted to use the slow shutter speed to capture slight motion blur of models in 10 rolls i shot using focal length mostly in 80 125mm range but occasionally 10 stretched to 200mm i found i have less than 3 of shots have perceivably camera shake this percentage is much smaller than those out of focus shots as i used the autofocus of the camera without mb 10 i wouldnt dared to use such low shutter speed for handhold shooting i have two pleasant surprises one is that i found that with mb 10 attached the horizontal handling of the camera becomes very pleasant as mb 10 extends the handgrip of the camera a little it with the added weight the camera is noticeably steadier for handholding shots the other surprise is that the build quality of mb 10 is better than i expected although i havent used the camera mb 10 on a tripod yet but i believe it will provide a better camera support on a tripod despite the added weight mb 10 hugs a camera snugly throughout the entire base of the camera and base of mb 10 provides a lager area of contact for the tripod

4056086 given the fact that we are currently undergoing a major review of our entire sport that is expected to see the face of the nbl change considerably in season 2009 10 this is a vote of confidence by fox sports in the future of our sport
4056087 its uncertain economic times and we dont know what the future holds but as it looks like today i think weve gone a long way of guaranteeing ourselves a certain level of revenue stream we can plan and we can budget with that and we can grow our program with that
4056088 the idea is to hit them real fast but only use five shots

4056093 following forensic tests and a post mortem on the cat it is believed that the animal was drowned recently probably in the washing up bowl in which it was found

4056115 this is a stylish and entertaining story about making choices and living with the consequences and right away i could clearly see myself playing the title role
4056116 her books were about women changing their lives flouting convention and addressing class tensions and extramarital sex
4056117 the power of winifred watsons story lies in its ability to make the reader happily believe that anything might be possible
4056118 miss pettigrew embodies the dashed hopes and expectations of anyone whose life hasnt quite worked out as they might have hoped it would
4056119 this rather prim woman with very little experience of the real world finds herself among a bunch of rather racy types over the course of the next 24 hours she sorts out delysias life through sheer common sense and rather wonderfully her own life gets sorted too
4056120 reading the book i felt that winifred watson was telling us about women who in fact exist
4056121 she is a vicars daughter and was brought up very properly when she lost her fianc in world war i her life just kind of stopped and she had to go on to service as a governess she still has her clothes that she got for her trousseau with the wedding
4056122 the one major script change i made was to get away from the idea that miss pettigrews rhythm was one of reticence and shyness and that she was incapable of finishing a sentence my change was that she completed every sentence miss pettigrew knows exactly what she thinks and what she wants to say its that people just dont hear her finish her sentence because they dont realise shes there
4056123 at the start of the story miss pettigrew is dowdy with particularly uncontrollable hair but when the mirror turns to reveal her new look she is still the same person just in different clothes she discovers that its not about getting rid of what she was before but about fully inhabiting who she was before and taking control of her life over the course of a day like no other in her life
4056124 at the start of the story miss pettigrew is a very shy and neglected woman seemingly good at nothing
4056125 she goes from being the least important person in the room to the most important person in the room not through money or looks but because she is an innately good human being she becomes like a magnet for people like delysia who realise that they have become desperate to know how to sort out their lives trying to make the right moral decision in a complex set of circumstances is an eternal problem for us all
4056126 while delysia is willing to be whoever anyone wants her to be in order to become a star guinevere is willing to become what delysia wants her to be whether its a personal assistant or referee in her affairs because shes horribly poor
4056127 yet delysia doesnt judge guinevere based on her looks which is how she is judged all the time with she and guinevere becoming friends delysia is able to ask herself for the first time what do i really want to do with my life guinevere meanwhile gains confidence advising and supporting delysia and realising that there is a second act in her own life

4056206 theres a huge buzz around the place its great to come into a place where everyone is so keen the training has been hard and really good and everyone has been so positive
4056207 the way the boys get together is really impressive knowing that last season had its troubles the way they have knuckled down and the spirit in the camp is amazing
4056208 everyone is moving in the same direction which can only be good for the team
4056209 i had heard about ravenhill and the crowd and what effect that had on the team it had a lot to do with my decision to come here
4056210 i knew about the successes in the past and while last season the results were not good there is a lot of potential here and the lads want to move forward its a great place to be
4056211 the team has now set standards and it is up to us to meet them it is up to us to move forward the likes of munster and leinster are leading things in ireland and we have to be up there with them
4056212 i picked up a niggling leg injury during pre season but picked up a niggling injury and it stopped me running but im fine now the pre season training is as high quality as i have encountered

4056220 with the ever rising price of scrap metal continuing to soar thieves are increasing their raids on drain covers the drain cover thefts cost taxpayers millions of pounds while exposing drivers and pedestrians to injury or death

4056229 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse

4056291 unlike players from teams established in the premier league we had no money no reputation or image to project no flash cars and nobody had their mortgage paid off
4056292 we had everything to prove and nothing to lose none of us had played in the premier league but we had nothing to be scared of it was just 11 different players than we had faced before
4056293 this changed in our second season suddenly we had flash cars images egos and everyone knew who we were and when we didnt freshen things up with new players we were in a dangerous situation
4056294 all too quickly we went from being a side that could lose three games and bounce back immediately by winning three games to a side which could lose eight games in a row and that just killed us
4056295 there was a real lord of the flies split which i had never experienced before
4056296 we didnt feel we were all together and i was partly to blame

4056432 this is so important for us all as individuals as well as for the country i believe that we are at last seeing a shift in our culture where no longer will it be socially acceptable to say that i cant do mathematics and i am even proud of it
4056433 however if we are to make further progress next year and beyond it is essential that we maintain our efforts to engage young people in science and maths
4056434 we are delighted that the trend is continuing students are increasingly aware that a levels in physics are seen by business and academia as the rolls royce of a levels and well worth all the effort when lining up for university places and the very best jobs but more still needs to be done to entice girls into the physics classroom
4056435 further ringing endorsement of both high quality teaching standards and student attainment
4056436 young peoples commitment to their personal development is borne out by an unprecedented pass rate
4056437 what rankles with the nut are the sustained attempts by commentators to denigrate such concrete achievements and argue that a levels are now easier
4056438 this is too often built on a lack of any real evidence and seeks only to undermine the success story
4056439 these results confirm that students and their teachers have set new records in terms of their attainment against the a level gold standard these are olympian achievements and represent years of hard work and sustained effort by students and teachers alike
4056440 the results confirm that schools are delivering world class educational standards and equipping young people for successful and independent lives
4056441 with more young people gaining key qualifications in maths sciences and modern foreign languages the outlook is bright for the countrys future economic competiveness

4056448 verbs which end in o generally mean to bring out that which a person is or that which is desired they do not have reference to the mode in which the action takes place in the case of dikaio it means either to bring out the fact that a person is righteous or if he is not to make him righteous to justify someone therefore means to bring out the fact that he is just or to make him just without necessarily referring to how he is made just

4056451 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4056452 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons

4056455 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4056456 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4056457 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4056458 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4056459 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4056460 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4056461 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4056462 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4056463 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4056464 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4056465 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4056466 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4056467 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4056468 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4056469 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4056470 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4056471 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4056472 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4056473 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4056474 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4056475 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4056476 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4056477 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4056479 anak yang yang teruja dengan filem berkenaan meminta saya membelikan mereka patung iron man di kedai terbabit yang berharga sekitar rm50 setiap satu
4056480 sewaktu membelek patung iron man mata anak sulung saya aiman mula menjeling ke rak pameran kaca di belakang kaunter pembayaran yang mempamerkan beberapa patung permainan lain
4056481 ada patung mainan itu bogel sepenuhnya dengan memperlihatkan bahagian sulit wanita malah kebanyakan patung itu beraksi mengghairahkan sehingga menyebabkan saya sendiri malu untuk memandang
4056482 saya lantas menarik anak daripada terus merenung deretan lebih 30 patung lucah berkenaan kerana bimbang boleh merosakkan minda mereka
4056483 bagi saya penjualan patung seumpama itu satu penghinaan kepada wanita berikutan cuba mengeksploitasi tubuh kaum hawa bagi mendapatkan keuntungan
4056484 apa yang dimaklumkan oleh peniaga kebanyakan patung permainan terlampau ini mendapat tempat terutama di kalangan remaja yang membelinya untuk koleksi peribadi atau dijadikan cenderamata kepada rakan rakan
4056485 pihak kdn memandang serius penjualan patung permainan berunsur lucah ini dan siasatan dilakukan sebaik berita berkenaan disiarkan tindakan perlu diambil kerana patung permainan lucah ini mengandungi unsur yang boleh memudaratkan moral masyarakat
4056486 operasi membabitkan lapan anggota kdn putrajaya dibantu pegawai kdn selangor diketuai penolong pegawai penguat kuasa kanan bahagian kawalan penerbitan dan teks al quran kdn mohamad hashim kamaruddin akhirnya berjaya mengesan pelbagai jenis patung lucah didapati dijual secara terbuka kepada orang ramai
4056487 hasil daripada bukti diperoleh pihak kdn bertindak merampas lebih 114 unit patung permainan berbaur lucah berkenaan dari semua premis terbabit
4056488 pemilik premis memiliki dan menjual patung itu boleh dikenakan hukuman mengikut seksyen 7 dengan penjara tidak melebihi lima tahun dan denda tidak kurang rm20 000
4056489 mereka mendakwa patung terbabit yang diimport terutama dari china berjaya melepasi pemeriksaan pihak berkuasa di pelabuhan sebelum diseludup ke negara ini

4056621 weve always been opposed to that sort of comedy and it really got us thinking about the type of show we wanted to make and thats what weve done in the second series its all about lower class people having cool fantasies and action adventures not just being bogans that people laugh at
4056622 she wanted to punish us for beating her favourite kath amp kim
4056623 thats why it took us so long to come back with a second series she never said as much to our face but it wasnt until she left and the new dude came that we were allowed to make another series

4056639 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4056640 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4056641 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4056642 he was an admirable arkansan and gave so much to this state and his party
4056643 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences
4056644 this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
4056645 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms

4056679 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4056680 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4056681 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4056682 but i love the guy never met a cooler person ever
4056683 we never wanted to make it big we wanted to play for our friends and family and anyone else interested we didnt want to shove our music down the medias throat
4056684 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4056685 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4056686 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4056687 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4056688 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4056689 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4056690 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4056691 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4056692 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4056693 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4056694 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4056695 when do you come to office and when do you leave

4056699 i spoke to mike ruddock about coming here at length and we spoke about the vision for the future at warriors now i am here i can fully appreciate where this club wants to be
4056700 the development that is going on here is so impressive with the new pitch and the stand going in and the direction in which the club is heading it means its all very exciting
4056701 sixways stadium has actually got a very similar feeling to ballymore in that the crowd feels as though it is going to be on top of you so youre going to be up close and personal with them
4056702 ive had my first training session with the boys and was really impressed by what i saw we have a lot of talent here and a number of young guys who really look the part and are keen to play some first team rugby
4056703 im not denying it was a massive decision to come here it took a while to sink in it was very difficult to leave the reds it was my home and it matured me into a man
4056704 but this is a new start and the transition here has gone smoothly the family is extremely happy with the town itself and what it has to offer that is crucial to me
4056705 i have had many highlights in my career playing my first game for queensland my first test for australia but pulling on the warriors jersey for the first time will be right up there i simply cant wait to get started for this club
4056706 i have seen a few guinness premiership matches and look forward to being part of such a strong league with so many great players now i want to make my mark and show what i am about as a player

4056714 your daughter is dead why trouble the teacher any further

4056719 the key debate for those who teach a level students and undergraduates is whether the pressure on teachers and lecturers to spoon feed a level students through exams means students fail to develop the desire to continue learning and the skills to learn independently
4056720 we urge the government to completely rethink the current targets regime as well as the curriculum and the current post 16 exams to make schooling more relevant so students leave school with the skills they need and a hunger to learn
4056721 we appreciate the frustration of viewers its a minority who have been affected by these enhancements
4056722 dmol the company that runs the engineering behind freeview completed the technical changes for the uk last week
4056723 together with the manufacturers were doing all we can to help viewers find the best value replacement
4056724 our mum really encouraged us from as early as year six and prepared us from a young age to take control of our own learning

4056726 from the time these chicks were collected in norway and brought over to scotland in june ive watched them grow up and now theyre raring to go
4056727 this is a very important moment for the birds as they take their first flights into scottish skies they will be facing many challenges in the years ahead and like others ill be crossing my fingers that they find their way and breed in the future
4056728 the sea eagle is one of the cornerstones of scotlands species reestablishment programme and it will be an incredible experience for more people to see these huge birds in their natural environment
4056729 annual sterile debate which claims that improved results mean dumbing down
4056730 the public can have full confidence that ofqual the independent guardian of standards will provide a robust transparent regulatory framework which can continue to give people confidence in the standards of both new and existing qualifications and tests
4056731 the continued increase in those taking sciences and languages also vital for the health of uk business is also positive and testament to our drive to increase take up of these subjects
4056732 todays results give us good reason for optimism and our further reforms will help pave the way to a world class education for all
4056733 this is so important for us all as individuals as well as for the country i believe that we are at last seeing a shift in our culture where no longer will it be socially acceptable to say that i cant do mathematics and i am even proud of it
4056734 however if we are to make further progress next year and beyond it is essential that we maintain our efforts to engage young people in science and maths
4056735 we are delighted that the trend is continuing students are increasingly aware that a levels in physics are seen by business and academia as the rolls royce of a levels and well worth all the effort when lining up for university places and the very best jobs but more still needs to be done to entice girls into the physics classroom
4056736 further ringing endorsement of both high quality teaching standards and student attainment
4056737 young peoples commitment to their personal development is borne out by an unprecedented pass rate
4056738 what rankles with the nut are the sustained attempts by commentators to denigrate such concrete achievements and argue that a levels are now easier
4056739 this is too often built on a lack of any real evidence and seeks only to undermine the success story
4056740 these results confirm that students and their teachers have set new records in terms of their attainment against the a level gold standard these are olympian achievements and represent years of hard work and sustained effort by students and teachers alike
4056741 the results confirm that schools are delivering world class educational standards and equipping young people for successful and independent lives
4056742 with more young people gaining key qualifications in maths sciences and modern foreign languages the outlook is bright for the countrys future economic competiveness

4056763 such as the ability to live to old age engage in economic transactions or participate in political activities these are construed in terms of the substantive freedoms people have reason to value instead of utility happiness desire fulfilment or choice or access to resources income commodities assets
4056764 kelley notes that positive liberty evolved out of economic and natural risks such as poverty and old age
4056765 advocates of positive freedom have exploited concepts of coercion and freedom insisting that lack of a certain opportunity deprives a person of the freedom to choose that opportunity
4056766 a notion that makes sense only if we assume that individuals in some new sense
4056767 the concept of positive freedom arises from an invalid attempt to ignore the distinctions by insisting that the presence of certain options among ones alternatives is equivalent to freedom of choice among ones alternatives and that the absence of an option is equivalent to coercive interference with ones freedom
4056768 the price of positive freedom is the sacrifice of genuine liberty
4056769 all have something with which to bargain and none have too much
4056770 i wanted a perfect ending now ive learned the hard way that some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next delicious ambiguity

4056789 sorry about that rebecca the one thing about this business is that your mind needs to be able to stop and go at a moments notice one of my listings is getting a lot of work done before it goes on the market and that was one of the tradesmen these types of interruptions happen all the time
4056790 in the past you could divide china into strips where wealth was focused on the coast and the population became poorer as you moved inland nowadays
4056791 the wealth in china is spread out and there is exponential growth in luxury consumption diamond buying culture is growing
4056792 china is very optimistic that this long term trend will continue
4056793 we believe that the future of relations with israel is very bright
4056794 we have to understand that chinas approach is different that they try to take the middle road
4056795 the chinese prefer talking or appeasement in the positive sense we also ought to keep in mind that china buys 13 of irans total oil production
4056796 that definitely harmed our ties and our prestige in china suffered
4056797 until that point the chinese had treated israel as a power but suddenly they realized the true dimensions of israels strength
4056798 youll notice that this growth has tipped the balance from two thirds in their favor to three fourths in their favor
4056799 israels gdp is high the people here have lots of purchasing power that is attractive for chinese manufacturers who can sell their goods here
4056800 we are also very impressed with israels engineers and with its research and development capabilities and we want chinese companies to participate in infrastructure projects here
4056801 we see significant potential in china in internet gaming medical devices and services information technology cleantech and many other domains
4056802 whats more is that government regulation is becoming more mature leading to greater protection of intellectual property for example there has been consistent progress in all areas over time and we are confident that will continue in a controlled manner
4056803 people asked why they should bother looking east today you can not afford not to now basically every company has to define some kind of china strategy
4056804 in the past when chinas foreign minister would go abroad he would talk about taiwan all the time now the foreign minister talks about energy and about investments in places like africa
4056805 china has enormous amounts of funds for investment it is more concerned about oiling the chinese machine and keeping it going
4056806 we have to recognize that we are insignificant in terms of numbers and size but that we are a powerhouse in terms of creativity innovation and technology
4056807 the days of israelis going to china to teach the chinese how to milk cows are over if they want the chinese can buy millions of cows and give them to us as a gift so when i hear people in the government speaking about china as if it were a place where we need to educate people it is disturbing
4056808 that israelis think that 1 3 billion people need to be taught is arrogance and it needs to change quickly because let me tell you we have nothing to teach them actually we have much to learn
4056809 we have to learn from them how in a very short time they transformed their economy and instituted a revolution in the way their bureaucracy took its hands off the economy to let it surge forward we have to learn how the government builds a strategy and then implements it without changing its ministers and its policies every two years if they can do it with 1 3 billion people dozens of languages and a huge stretch of land then we who have 7 million people in a much smaller land have to be able to do it too
4056810 free for people to do a short sale and in most instances it doesnt impact your credit

4056820 the ones who are playing are in the water and theyre going to do a good job for sure im going to prepare the team the next couple of days for the game against greece but execution is coming from the players in the water
4056821 when i was doing a little more than i was supposed to they said ok you cant stay here
4056822 jovanovic said he complained that referees were letting the australians get away with illegal tactics above and below the water
4056823 thats something i cant stand im not going to just close my eyes to that
4056824 canada also had three players foul out of the physical match center forward nathaniel miller argued with one of the refs regarding his third and final major foul
4056825 i thought i wont be able to get a medal therefore at that moment i didnt think anything except for continuing the competition
4056826 his parents left wednesday and missed his big day but it was no less exciting
4056827 whether my parents are here or not it will not affect my performance

4056829 i had been training for the african champs since january

4056831 its a great feeling and i am looking forward to it
4056832 i am focused confident and ready botswana has never won a medal in the olympics so it would be a pleasure for me to win
4056833 every kid would grow up and their parents would take them to a football field without trying to find out where they are talented
4056834 they just buy them a ball and they play football there is a lot of talent for athletics
4056835 why is the commish driving two hours in a packed minivan while the care bears movie is on continuous play and gas is more than 4 00 a gallon he is just a jeff francoeur throw from the beaches on the southeast coast of florida
4056836 y ou may have been subject to a phishing scam
4056837 those who distribute money at or around the precinct must be identified and punished clarification is also needed in the legal framework on what constitutes vote buying
4056838 observers noted that many voters did not vote by themselves and were assisted by the beis this process increases potential for abuse since beis and assistants may influence voters decision or even vote on their behalf
4056839 beis and their assistants should receive sufficient training about their role and responsibility and code of conduct as well as the technical aspects of election
4056840 comelec and other election stakeholders should pay greater attention to voters secrecy to protect and respect the individual rights of voters and to ensure that all precincts follow established polling processes
4056841 all of the others were just waiting nobody had the courage to attack
4056842 why some senators are not honoring their signatures in the resolution is something for them to explain but whatever it is we respect their position on this
4056843 no longer interested to push for constitutional reforms for federalism especially for mindanao our expectations are that charter change towards federalism in mindanao will not take off soon
4056844 the fact remains that it was the senate that started pushing for the convening of congress into a constituent assembly not president arroyo
4056845 the president is merely being consistent with her campaign platform for constitutional reforms she believes that a federal setup is an aspiration of all mindanaoans her strong advocacy for it is not a subterfuge for an extension of her term resolution no 10 does not provide for such possibility
4056846 im sorry i have to do this kyle but you stole amanda from me and my spot on the field
4056847 kyle i want to talk to you about something privately

4056849 why me isnt ricky already the captain why would you want me to take his place
4056850 well yes but he hasnt been doing to well lately he seems to be slacking off

4056852 so it looks like youre the new captain i cant believe you took my position away i dont know how i thought you were my friend what or who are you going to still from me next

4056855 theres always a little bit of rivalry between the four of us i think thats what spurs us on
4056856 sometimes we worked together helping each other when our subjects overlapped but mostly we worked apart
4056857 it was quite chaotic in the house in the run up to the exams but everybody knuckled down
4056858 youd go into a room and find there was already someone in there revising and it would be like oh no
4056859 our mum really encouraged us from as early as year six and prepared us from a young age to take control of our own learning
4056860 weve realised that aiming for the highest is really going to help us
4056861 at first we were probably pushed on but now we see it as the best way to help ourselves
4056862 we all know weve tried our best especially going through the exam process together weve all been helping each other
4056863 its more like holding each others hand and being there
4056864 at first it wasnt very easy for me to get on with my fellow students and i couldnt understand everything the teachers said
4056865 but my english teacher helped me and encouraged me to read books and told me i would have to work harder

4056979 thats exactly the case with mobile tv and the olympics
4056980 tv will become a standard feature for cellphones in china by the end of this year just like cameras
4056981 the original plan was to distribute the phones after the games
4056982 however china mobile decided to do it before the games kicked off because they think the development of mobile tv technology has already reached a satisfactory level
4056983 nowadays peoples attention and time is segmented so they want multi functional converged handsets
4056984 so copying tv content to mobile phones is attractive to many people

4057041 singapore is almost certainly the most pedestrian friendly city in southeast asia sidewalks and pedestrian crossings are in good shape and plentiful roads are well signposted and by asian standards drivers are usually very careful by law any accident between a pedestrian and a vehicle is presumed to be the drivers fault classic walks in singapore include walking down the river from the merlion through the quays or just strolling around chinatown little india or bugis
4057042 kl is a notoriously pedestrian hostile city with heavy traffic and aggressive drivers few pedestrian crossings pathways and poorly maintained foot paths walking within some districts e g chinatown and bukit bintang is feasible but walking long distance generally is not lately pick pockets and bag snatchers on motorbikes have been a problem especially in chinatown district so care needs to be taken when it rains the sidewalks and streets turn into small rivers and crossing a street can be an adventure

4057056 we came here simply to restore order and now it is secure here see i can drive around unarmed
4057057 the russians came first then the ossetians who shot at anyone they saw
4057058 the ossetians walk into homes take any valuables they want and then burn the rest
4057059 the russians are looting everything in sight the whole city is full of marauders
4057060 who in the world is going to help us nobody cares

4057064 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4057065 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4057066 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4057067 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4057068 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4057069 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4057070 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4057071 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4057072 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4057073 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4057074 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4057075 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4057076 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4057077 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4057086 our staff are not trained to supervise infants and theyre not trained in infant first aid or anything

4057091 a lot of healing went on for me in the six months i was in there with those babies
4057092 these children that are allowed to be there are the focus of much love and care and attention
4057093 the hope is that they walk away with those tools and ideas and motivation to continue to do what they need to do to excel at their sport
4057094 its important because for socioeconomic reasons these kids dont normally have access to the equipment the quality facility and the quality coaching and instruction
4057095 they sign an agreement that as long as they commit to the program the program commits back to them
4057096 it is a goal i think my chances are up to me
4057097 then again when youre racing against time injury also comes into play because youre pushing yourself to go bigger and do bigger tricks faster than you normally would

4057128 it may still be summer but there is a feeling of chill in the economic air
4057129 cannot be avoided as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing

4057168 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4057169 the eu must be ready to engage including on the ground to support all efforts including those of the and the osce for a lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflicts in georgia
4057170 we were looking at what kind of threats may arise from development of drugs for therapeutic use
4057171 what if they were used in some unintended way what is the future landscape of the type of threats that could occur and how could you detect these possible threats in the future as new drugs or medical technology become part of our health care
4057172 these may be areas that the intelligence experts would want to keep an eye on
4057173 i think its important for national security that analysts think about what sort of issues may arise in the future as academic and commercial research continues to rapidly expand technology and its abilities
4057174 i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years
4057175 we saw and tested the movie and we believe a strong movie deserves a strong play date

4057177 he had a tantrum and ran out of the meeting
4057178 hill said thats what played a key role in earning his business
4057179 our competitors such as ibm accenture and hewlett packard funded the study we didnt
4057180 we were the only professional services firm to get this award it has given us a huge competitive advantage
4057181 we are highly energized by ibms investment because it directly responds to our call for increased private sector investment into sustainable initiatives that advance priority technical skills
4057182 when i was young i was a hippie and we did crazy things
4057183 but god forbid there should be a record of that the way there is for kids today on facebook and myspace we did the same things back then but we didnt have the data tail
4057184 electrons are very patient once its out there its out there
4057185 an ecological view of security rather than an absolute view
4057186 we really need to work on systems that can alert someone when they have been victimized
4057187 the police also need to take on a role so that these crimes can be properly investigated and prosecuted
4057188 when it comes to security and crime there are two major disincentives
4057189 first there are the protection systems like the vault at the bank the second is the judicial system which says if you get caught you will be put in jail or worse but as we move into the digital internet age that second component has been very weak businesses have been challenged to come up with great security technologies but where is the government analog some of these cyber crime cases are entirely dependent on expert witnesses because no one else knows about this stuff and many of these cases take place across national borders which highlights the many problems with international law
4057190 government is probably the least capable organizations in terms of dealing with modern security threats
4057191 in the future it will be communities that are more powerful in this regard
4057192 can you trust the wisdom of a community or are they just a mob
4057193 were facing a long term crisis and there is an abundance of blissful ignorance
4057194 i know this conversation is supposed to be about rainbows and unicorns but the internet is horribly horribly broken
4057195 every new technology has the inherent ability to be used for good or evil
4057196 i race cars and when i race cars im thankful for having brakes because they allow me to go fast
4057197 thats what having security does for business it allows it to move more quickly and efficiently
4057198 all the technology in the world wont bring you more security just look at iraq
4057199 the key to the bids is to secure the money for the industry to use and we need people who already carry out knowledge transfer training to come forward and apply to use this money
4057200 the money will be used to help support existing initiatives and encourage new ideas to benefit levy payers in terms of staff development and complement the current work of the bpex kt team
4057201 we want to hear from firms organisations and individuals who carry out this sort of work and let us know what they have to offer the british pig industry
4057202 i believe he would say it s his child for his buddy
4057203 i think his loyalty to edwards is very strong he was just part of his team
4057204 seemed to be crazy about their kids and crazy about each other
4057205 there s no way she d agree to letting him stay with her if
4057206 its bound to be the case that there is the possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth
4057207 the government will end up having to borrow significantly more than expected
4057208 employment growth has ebbed to a trickle indeed employment has fallen in several regions while the rise in unemployment is gaining worrying momentum
4057209 the figures are a tragedy and hide the misery for tens of thousands of households where people lose their jobs
4057210 the economy is losing momentum but with inflation set to rise to 5 per cent or more in the short term there is little room for interest rate cuts in the immediate future
4057211 the welcome news is that the numbers on incapacity benefits and lone parent benefit continue to fall as our reforms kick in
4057212 there are still 380 000 more people in work than a year ago

4057227 whites fear discrimination by public services some 29 per cent of people surveyed think public sector workers discriminate against them in favour of other ethnic groups and many believe they have been passed over for promotion or a job because of the colour of their skin and the study reveals that ethnic groups living in the uk feel stronger ties to the country than native whites researchers found that whites also felt less able than other ethnic groups to influence decisions affecting the country or their local area and many believe racial prejudice is on the rise in stark contrast with other races
4057228 against the russian majority in south ossetia russia says that some 2 000 civilians were killed and 100 000 displaced there are only 70 000 inhabitants in south ossetia condoleezza rice the us secretary of state urged mr lavrov in a telephone call to desist from using the two expressions in relation to georgias actions the russian minister said president medvedev also used the terms on tuesday with mr sarkozy
4057229 on the russian side foreign minister mr lavrov said that this changed nothing about the essence of the accords whatever the wording the reality of the russian dominated provinces had now changed
4057230 the state has survived the openness boom in fairly robust health the idea that globalisation meant the end of government was either undue pessimism or wishful thinking depending on your politics if government is making a comeback so is global governance

4057232 in both countries hans gert p ttering met important religious leaders grand mufti of the republic of syria ahmad badr al din hassoun and the greek catholic patriarch gregorius iii at a joint meeting with several of them he was very much impressed by the good understanding that prevails between the various religious communities amazing considering all other information on the situation of christians there especially in lebanon where christans are fleeing severe muslim persecution but of course in the eyes of the multicultural eu boss this is the fault of the christians the original population who have lived in the middle east and europe for much too long they just have to submit to allah the meaning of islam as he has done himself alongside with all eurocrats people sit like spellbound before their tv sets envy the neighbouring countries of their medals and shout with joy when a fellow countryman wins for they identify themselves with winning felllow countrymen and become proud could they obtain the same pride through the achievements of a korean nationalism has caused much evil however the loss of national identity may cause even worse things for today it ist the sole force of cohesion between europeans and so the only bulwark against islam which is strong due to a religious international identity eu and the undercurrents of the new world order strive vigorously to destroy our identities supporting islam to pave the road for the march of the new world order through the orient to secure the union of the world state with china and japan the eu knows that islamic identity cannot be moved consequently we must be without identity to be absorbed by the international umma national identity means the difference between freedom and bondage oh i nearly forgot to mention the ongoing olympic games in pekin they have fostered a mighty chinese national pride we are being told according to the independent on aug 2008

4057236 im schizophrenic paranoid i think everyone is watching me i think im being judged which is kind of true and kind of not

4057239 theyve tried to flush it down clog the toilet flood the area or theyve tried to harm themselves
4057240 theyre here and theyre going to be cared for but is this what we want in the way of a policy are we saying the legal system is the solution for the mentally ill in l a county i dont think so im saying criminals belong in jail not the mentally ill
4057241 im a guest in this country it would be preposterous of me to offer an opinion on the political status of a duly elected public official
4057242 last night dr mann was resisting calls to tone down his political rhetoric
4057243 if i were responsible for an unjust war based on lies in which tens of thousands of people had been killed i might have concerns about meeting my maker
4057244 my son is getting married and im attending the wedding i plan to come back
4057245 i dont know it could really go either way at this point public opinion is volatile and in american politics a week is a long time no one at this stage of the process is taking anything for granted
4057246 now go forth to live your hopes and not your fears knowing you are held in holy hands by a love that will never let you go
4057247 i saw the costellos a couple of weeks ago and theyre in good form theyre both very healthy and happy and thats nice and i hope they have a very nice day
4057248 im not getting into that off limits not talking good try but i saw it coming mr howard said
4057249 these sort of awards are beyond party politics mr rudd told reporters in adelaide
4057250 we should all acknowledge mr howards long contribution to australian national political life
4057251 i congratulate him and wish him well with his award
4057252 he did it all for his electorate and he believed that was his role to represent his constituents and i think he did that in a very honourable and efficient way
4057253 this year there was an exceptional amount of ice according to expedition leader prof gerhard kattner the extent reached from the high north southward to 74 degrees latitude the main objective of the research cruise was to check 17 moorings with instruments that monitor temperature salinity and currents of the water masses awi has been carrying out these unique high latitude investigations since 1999 observed 2008 temperatures are slightly lower than 2006 measurements and there are preliminary indications of a return of the pacific water mass signature which has been absent since 2004
4057254 for this purpose we had to move last year the devices embodied at the bottom of the sea further northward in order to follow the retreating ice and guarantee that they at least temporarily stood in the sphere of influence of the edge of ice
4057255 its also completely unnecessary to exaggerate the dramatic changes soon to come from global warming contrary to what some believe theres no need to exaggerate the danger reality will be plenty scary enough
4057256 since the mid 2000 to present average is so much less than the 1978 to 2000 average the anomalies using my choice of reference period are numerically not nearly so negative as those using the cryosphere today reference
4057257 microsoft is more than happy with its position in the mobile phone space in addition a zune phone may make no sense at all given microsofts less than impressive
4057258 there is speculation form some quarters that this will be microsofts last attempt to boost the devices sales
4057259 zune is not fading away and again we are pleased with our progress against an entrenched competitor apple
4057260 zune is a long term investment for microsoft today there is much focus on the stand alone portable media player but if you look across the entertainment and devices division at microsoft you can see how in the not too distant future a customers entertainment experience could flow across the pc xbox mobile phones and automotive
4057261 while nothing specific has been announced by microsoft the company said it is not done in the mp3 player market and consumers should keep their eyes on zune

4057274 weve learned that winston was suddenly operated on again today
4057275 he is reportedly weak we fear infection but hold on to better thoughts
4057276 the farmer said okay if you take this kid up for a ride so he took me up and the first thing i noticed was how cool it was here i was far above the earth and it was cool well it didnt take me long to decide that flying was for me
4057277 he had the ability to make friends that was how he was so successful he was able to make friends who helped him throughout his life he was just a wonderful colorful character
4057278 this investigation has been going on for 14 years and ive had the case for less than a year
4057279 however mr dion has a constitutional right to a competent attorney a fair trial as well as his due process rights
4057280 its just so wrong that victims dont have a right the victims family just gets dragged through all this
4057281 is the cloud right for you ask yourself these 5 questions
4057282 i do now have to tell alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although i have only now become aware of it
4057283 many of these inquiries were completely appropriate however the serial nature of the contacts could be perceived as some kind of pressure presumably at my direction
4057284 todd and sarah are scratching their heads why on earth hasnt this why is this guy still representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool you know
4057285 i used to be a recruiter i know a lot of times that information is extremely confidential
4057286 im telling you honestly you know she really likes walt a lot but on this issue she feels like its she doesnt know why there is absolutely no action for a year on this issue its very very troubling to her and the family i could definitely relay that
4057287 my fear was wooten could fly off the handle and do something that was irreversible
4057288 that concern that fear has always been in the back of my mind
4057289 i made an inquiry and was told by commissioner monegan that there was a process in place and that it was handled and it was over and i reported back to the first gentleman that there was nothing more that could be done
4057290 its absolutely appropriate that a chief of staff was checking on staff issues and personnel policy and procedure
4057291 did not turn out to be a team player on budgeting issues
4057292 the response he got was dont come to us and ask for more money when you cannot fill the 56 or 58 trooper positions that were vacant
4057293 so he was making a pitch for additional funding when he couldnt even fill what he currently had available to him
4057294 this is such a terrible situation to happen to people no one foresees that their dog will do something like that
4057295 its already attacked somebody so theres no reason to keep it alive
4057296 i just want it to be over and done with
4057297 its just a nice thing to do and not have to come home and worry about that

4057310 why would we jeopardize matts job why would we risk the embarrassment of the backlash that we would get we just have a lot to lose if this is a hoax i thought bigfoot trackers and hunters were ridiculous and i made fun of them to be honest and i still do they know nothing as fact we do

4057313 its the first time ive been to the centre this year and i noticed that there were workmen working on the wall adjoining the toilet block and shower block
4057314 i went down to the changing room to look for a locker and then a young guy ran out of the showers in a towel and said there was c p coming out of the drain and it smelled terrible
4057315 he had been in the shower when it happened and ive never seen anyone look so disgusted it was like a car crash part of me wanted to crane my neck and have a look but part of me thought i would be sick if i did so i decided not to
4057316 staff responded very quickly but i never went back into the changing room
4057317 i havent been keen to go back it does make you worry especially with the centre being upgraded that theyre not doing repairs and keeping the place as up to date as it should be
4057318 you hope that its a one off and not indicative of anything else
4057319 you just feel they are not putting enough money into keeping it clean and safe

4057321 i was reading bedtime stories to my eldest son roy who was four at the time and when he climbed on my chest it was sore
4057322 i went to my gp to check it out and he referred me to falkirk royal infirmary where they discovered that it was breast cancer
4057323 i was devastated i thought it was the end and thought why me when you hear the word cancer you think thats it youre going to die i wanted to see my son grow up and have children and now i wasnt going to be there it was awful
4057324 i was told when i was put on tamoxifen that it could make me infertile to be told i couldnt have any more children was terrible as my husband and i were trying for another baby then as well
4057325 i was really happy i couldnt believe it we were told there was a risk to me and the baby if i got pregnant and that either one of us might not survive so he was a wee miracle
4057326 i take each day as it comes appreciate my children more and try to make the most of my life because you just dont know whats going to happen

4057328 overall the rates for both are reducing we have targets were being asked to meet and we are meeting them
4057329 its obviously more than we would want as smoking during pregnancy can cause real problems for the baby such as low birth weight or other complications
4057330 we dont have local figures yet but since the smoking ban it seems theres been a real benefit as its prompting more people to try to quit which is excellent news
4057331 nationally were seeing a reduction in heart attacks in the short term since the smoking ban and thats no different in dunfermline and west fife
4057332 improvements are being made on some aspects but weve absolutely no cause for complacency
4057333 were seeing an increase in the proportion of children and adults who are overweight and obese and its closely linked with type 2 diabetes
4057334 were beginning to see children with that type of illness now
4057335 the levels of obesity are a concern and it is a national problem
4057336 if youre eating the wrong sorts of food and not doing enough physical activity its a double whammy and it is a concern particularly among women
4057337 a big issue for us is lifestyle weve mentioned weight problems and although some people are quitting following the smoking ban theres still a long way to go
4057338 but the amount of alcohol people are drinking is an increasing concern as too many are underestimating how much theyre taking
4057339 thats the key to this data it tells us a story and helps us understand that where there are stark differences we need to look at them further

4057360 labour is increasing investment in nhs dentistry so that patients now pay a lower proportion of the total cost of dental treatment than they did under the tories
4057361 patient charges have stayed the same in real terms as they have gone up in line with inflation

4057373 i dont think we should ever take that for granted because events come along but there has been a catastrophic loss of trust in gordon browns government
4057374 i think he will find it very difficult to rebuild that trust but we are under no illusion that the public becoming disillusioned with the government doesnt automatically mean that they will embrace the opposition we have to work to gain their trust and that is what we are doing now
4057375 we have proposed measures on fuel duty on vehicle excise duty changes on stamp duty for first time buyers and ideas on reforming corporate insolvency law to make it easier for businesses to stay afloat when they are hit by the credit crunch to preserve jobs
4057376 gordon brown has for a long time boasted that one of britains great strengths was low inflation but we now see british inflation significantly higher than eurozone inflation
4057377 one of the reasons for that is clearly down to a government policy failure
4057378 because the markets are no longer satisfied with the state of our economy and in particular the state of the public finances sterling is taking a hammering on the currency markets and as sterling slides the cost of everything increase disproportionately and so we are taking a double hit from the international rise in energy prices and the weakness of sterling
4057379 it is just another sign of the chaos and confusion that is gripping the government when they used to be quite good at managing the news agenda
4057380 the issue of stamp duty was spun quite shamelessly to cover the bad news story of
4057381 people will be shocked to see that there are areas of the country where fewer than one in eight children sit a levels as ever it is the poorest areas that are worst affected
4057382 it is a scandal that in some of the most deprived parts of the country there are more children under 18 not in employment or training than there are studying for top academic qualifications
4057383 this back of a fag packet maths adds nothing to the picture on a levels and completely ignores the fact that many youngsters travel between boroughs to do their a levels do other qualifications or work based training or apprenticeships
4057384 for example according to these flawed figures kensington and chelsea apparently has 193 per cent of their pupils studying a levels all this shows is that some boroughs have a lot of pupils travelling to do their a levels which is very common
4057385 the fact is more young people are staying on in education than ever before if the

4057392 sometimes when i reflect back on all the beer i drink i feel ashamed then i look into the glass and think about the workers in the brewery and all of their hopes and dreams if i didnt drink this beer they might be out of work and their dreams would be shattered

4057466 they like that were in the porn business and even though we couldnt do anything explicit we could still give a wink and a nudge to our fans and theirs by having sex in the bathroom or at least as close to sex as we could get in a video like this
4057467 when the fans see us in mainstream projects like this they tell me its like theyre in a secret club and knowing who we are is the handshake

4057525 mccain like his republican brethren have been in big oils pocket and have fought against energy independence and after the energy crisis of 73 theres just no excuse for that the republicans and big oil sold out america
4057526 i will take public financing and spend within the cap
4057527 i dont think we are going to re ignite the cold war
4057528 president bushs decision to send aid to the people of georgia and americans stand united in support of the men and women who will carry out this humanitarian mission
4057529 must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words
4057530 the united states and europe must review our multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia in light of its actions
4057531 will now need to review the full range of our relations
4057532 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4057533 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
4057534 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4057535 we are working hard to rebuild our credit in international swimming
4057536 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
4057537 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts
4057538 you had a duty as the captain of this plane to call the police and you didnt do it
4057539 part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups hispanics in particular
4057540 those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age
4057541 whos going to do the jobs that are characteristically held right now by certain types of people
4057542 we have been under siege for the last two years
4057543 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4057544 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act
4057545 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4057546 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen
4057547 i think a lot depends on what happens over the next few weeks
4057548 if we are able to have continued access in terms of humanitarian supplies to these people if there is safe space for the civilians in that area if both sides respect their responsibility to allow displaced people to move where they want to move they i think a crisis can be avoided
4057549 the ethnic majority sinhala nation is intent on occupying and enslaving the tamil homeland
4057550 our military is only involved in a war of self defence against this war of the sinhala nation
4057551 we will liberate the north sooner than people even think when you need to look at a bigger target a bigger goal you need to make certain sacrifices down the line and these are the sacrifices and for these sacrifices we are not going to let them down
4057552 theres a lot of evidence that it is credible and ill leave that to the professionals but we take every single case and assume it is credible until proven otherwise
4057553 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters
4057554 if they think also that somehow its all going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
4057555 we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness i think it will be an absolute disaster
4057556 i think we need to use all the safe technologies that are out there to produce safe wholesome food
4057557 i believe there are opportunities with gm that will be of great use there will be as with all technologies things that are useful and some that are not but until we look at the technology we dont know
4057558 but there are issues that need to be looked at over access to plant breeding and varieties
4057559 its the same with conventional varieties most are in the hands of the multinationals we are in that world already and its creating issues that have to be addressed on a daily basis
4057560 i think the prince has a genuine point there but he has probably gone two steps too far and i certainly cant seem gm crops being the death of the small farmer
4057561 i understand where the prince is coming from over the seeds because these corporations are holding the world to ransom
4057562 but we have to take a balanced approach and as far as food security is concerned its going to be a problem and gm could help a lot of marginal countries out of difficulty
4057563 if we are going to feed the world we need all the help we can get from technology
4057564 some county representatives have expressed concerns over the potential control wielded by the large seed and agrochemical companies and fears that such companies could develop monopolies over the welsh farming industry
4057565 as a union we fully recognise our members concerns and we will be constantly reviewing the situation
4057566 shamefully the westminster government and many previously sensible politicians have been swept along by this hype
4057567 the prince who has studied this issue for many years knows that gm crops will not solve the food crisis and he is right to highlight the environmental damage associated with industrial high input monocultures
4057568 the use of gm crops is associated with an inexorable rise in corporate feudalism with millions of independent farmers being forced into economic dependence and ultimately forced off the land
4057569 we support prince charles call for farming solutions that put people not corporations at their centre and we support his contention that ultimately all that matters is food security
4057570 a world in which gm crops are everywhere will be a world of food insecurity with the most appalling social and political consequences
4057571 as we have said many times there is an important debate to be had on the potential role of gm crops in the future and we welcome all voices in that debate
4057572 safety will always be our top priority on this issue
4057573 i believe that genetic modification is much more than just an extension of selective breeding techniques
4057574 mixing genetic material from species that cannot breed naturally takes us into areas that should be left to god we should not be meddling with the building blocks of life in this way
4057575 i believe this particular technology is so far reaching we should seek ways of engaging a wide range of people and interests in a thorough debate about how and where it should be applied
4057576 the idea that the different parts of the natural world are connected through an intricate system of checks and balances which we disturb at our peril is all too easily dismissed as no longer relevant
4057577 twenty years ago when i first started to use organic systems at highgrove it was met with complete ridicule
4057578 its interesting now that it isnt ridiculed to the same degree
4057579 i think people are beginning to realise that some of the chickens are coming home to roost and settle heavily in the genetically modified trees

4057581 in the us and europe broad access to media and entertainment has been available for decades through a large fixed distribution infrastructure and more recently in specialized devices like ipods to meet consumers entertainment needs
4057582 users in the growing brazil russia india and china markets havent had the benefit of broad based content distribution thereby limiting their exposure and are filling the service gap by embracing mobiles transition into a personal entertainment platform
4057583 we can make more money in mobile than we do in the desktop eventually and the reason is the mobile computer is more targeted think about it you carry your phone and your phone knows all about you we can do a very very targeted ad over time we will make more money from mobile advertising not now but over time

4057589 we loved him he was a poet and true palestinian patriot
4057590 he lived the whole palestinian life from 1948 until now

4057599 luckily it stayed dry all day and the sun broke through just after lunch
4057600 and the water was 64 degrees so that was a blessing
4057601 people who have grandiose ideas about how to run the world should try to start with a small garden
4057602 my wife and i started the club three years ago
4057603 there was a core of us that started doing it pretty seriously and competing regularly
4057604 two years ago we decided to create something to give us a collective identity at races and a forum for group training
4057605 we have low key competitors and beginners all the way to accomplished triathletes we all get together and share our experiences if nothing else its an opportunity for the social aspect of getting people together who have a similar interest
4057606 its not so much competition to match someone elses performance
4057607 but if there are four or five people going to a race you might say ill go too
4057608 without a doubt some folks are quite competitive with one another it may be unstated but its pretty obvious
4057609 we do all three events but in shortened form we swim a couple of hundred yards bike 10 miles and run a couple of miles were open to anyone who wants to join
4057610 it is good to have an end to journey towards but it is the journey that matters in the end
4057611 in the end we decide if were remembered for what happened to us or for what we did with it
4057612 those of us who have any familiarity with nestle or the other large corporations that are investing in the united states know that they have entire teams of people whose job it is to figure out how to get around the laws of any municipality any county and sometimes any state and thats how these trade agreements are drafted
4057613 the fact is that once this contract is signed you could be basically signing away your capacity in the future to regulate water in your area
4057614 she was a phi beta kappa from boston university and a teacher
4057615 she taught for eight years before she got married shes probably the sole reason i got through high school
4057616 this is one of the best if not the best resources we have
4057617 i want to help out but i also want other people to help out as well this is a school thats affordable education opens your eyes to the world
4057618 right now we plan to stay open until november but well be living here year round
4057619 who knows what might happen were just playing it by ear
4057620 we hope to turn that area into two more rooms
4057621 we would have to go back to the town for approval then wed use the lower level for the living area
4057622 as time passed he got tired of traveling so far to see his customers we were just looking for a small house here not a business
4057623 he said it was really run down but the foundation was very solid very good
4057624 strictly an accident we said if were going to be here why not try a b amp b
4057625 so far im having a good time the people staying here have been wonderful its been very pleasant
4057626 the 50 50 sounds like a good deal but when you do the numbers its not fair for kennebunk
4057627 its like a compromise between four and five and i can live with that
4057628 we are trying to come up with a plan that all the voters can pass
4057629 i just want to make it clear if we dont come up with some type of terms there is going to be a huge penalty
4057630 she was an outstanding candidate and i know shell be an outstanding coordinator shes enthusiastic and forward thinking im excited shes on board
4057631 i worked for two separate recycling companies friedman recycling in phoenix and e l harvey and sons in massachusetts i sold equipment for four years ive done dispatching and sales i have a lot of experience in customer service
4057632 the first thing is getting familiar with the scale and how things operate
4057633 i have a great team here of four people they kept everything up and running during the interim im happy theyre here i rely on them thats the most important thing having a good team
4057634 thats a good place to start i want to make sure were doing everything possible for the safety of the employees the public that uses the station and the environment id like to visit other transfer stations in the area that have similar characteristics and see what kind of things theyre doing
4057635 the town probably quadruples the amount of waste in the summer
4057636 so its good that i came in at a good time to see it really busy and how much the volume increases in the offseason once things slow down we can look at some of the housekeeping things
4057637 the initial thing is to evaluate the audit and the consultants report
4057638 well look at how we can incorporate some of the things here that have been successful i dont want to make change for the sake of change many things here are working well i want it to be a place where its safe to work and know that were doing the best we can for the town its a work in progress
4057639 that will affect more users with less of an impact
4057640 were taxing people who actually use more water not just because they have large meters
4057641 we looked at the number of customers affected in selecting a use level
4057642 we chose it based on what an average user would have used this will affect seasonals more we have to build our structure to handle the peak flow
4057643 the trustees felt that was a fairer way to bill
4057644 after the second round of interviews i would hope to be able to make a job offer and negotiate the terms of employment
4057645 so many books so little time a year of passionate reading
4057646 clement clark his father a master carpenter worked on the last of the sailing vessels to be built in kennebunkport and his uncle was in the shipbuilding business most of his life clark worked on his first vessel when he was 18 and after going into business for himself built several pleasure cruisers for the famous booth tarkington
4057647 she floated trim and jaunty and a cheer rose from the crowd she was the first topsail schooner to have been built in the kennebunks since 1867
4057648 we came in as the strong team and everyone knew it
4057649 i think it was the best 100 meter run ever in relay
4057650 weve had a great variety of people participate in the olympics over the years
4057651 jerry ashworth was a fantastic runner but was not alone by any stretch
4057652 it just so happened that someone knew about it about 10 years ago and it finally came up in a conversation
4057653 its designed to reflect the true cost of providing service to different classes of customers and also to encourage conservation
4057654 in general the cost of service study we performed was the first one weve ever done this one uses modern accounting principles
4057655 residential customers as a class and seasonal customers in particular are causing our seasonal usage peaks
4057656 but residentials that use very little water 50 gallons per day is our new minimum 100 used to be will see a 24 percent decrease a single family home using 500 gallons or more per day will see an increase of five percent or more
4057657 i encourage people to seek alternative water sources for irrigation during peak season
4057658 large commercials will pay more many small commercials will see a significant decrease
4057659 the seasonal accounts have more operating costs because they exacerbate peak demand
4057660 they are also more costly administratively because we have to close them out and then reopen them each year
4057661 only 10 percent of our users will see an increase over 2 percent
4057662 ninety percent were using 250 gallons or less per day the highest increase is about 28 percent for customers that use 1 500 gallons per day
4057663 seeing the ducks cross the bridge is a riot to watch
4057664 once in a while you get a straggler that goes off to the side and you need a kayaker to fish them out
4057665 when adequate parking facilities for the accommodation of traffic have been provided and paid for the rates fees and charges shall be adjusted to provide funds for maintenance and operation only
4057666 when i first eyeballed it the obvious reason for it was that there was a need for towns to spend money on parking lots they floated bonds on them there was only one court case and essentially it said that once youve paid them off you can continue to use the money for maintenance and repair and thats it
4057667 i dont know where this law actually plays into us
4057668 i dont have just one account it cuts across every department budget in some way visitor services the department that staffs the lots is one small piece of the big picture we spent two hours here this morning counting the receipts from the weekend for example its all about the parking lots in the summer
4057669 we have a lot more people coming to our beach and parking than they have which accounts for the increased income
4057670 expenses associated with one year arent necessarily the same as the next
4057671 for example we dont pave the lots every year and the costs cant be limited to just the beach area
4057672 as a company we have always believed that it is our responsibility to be good neighbors and to help our neighbors in need
4057673 this year as we all know is going to be especially difficult the need for heating assistance will likely be even greater than it was last year and we felt the need to increase our donation to these organizations
4057674 the meeting will help the ratepayers to understand how the process works and what their rights are
4057675 in most instances the person has a very specific issue they want to raise
4057676 if the maximum amount of water allowed had been taken we would have had 900 000 a year in additional revenue
4057677 thats a 16 percent increase for the average residential customer that pays about 300 it would be about a 50 saving

4057679 you make of it what you want to make of it
4057680 even if youre an adult and you read a book it takes you back to when you were younger
4057681 i still remember the first day my grandmother bought me a book it was great
4057682 you talk to a lot of people and they assume that there arent any new comic book collectors
4057683 comics have changed a lot its not just spider man and fantastic four and what you see in the movies right now
4057684 they even write moby dick and last of the mohicans and a lot of classic books
4057685 its a lot like any other kind of collecting in that people are complete ists
4057686 they dont just want issue number 12 and 35 it occupies your time for completing something
4057687 i dont think its the final goal of having them all
4057688 its the trip there once the guys have it all they lose interest and want to sell it
4057689 back in new york it was more adults about 90 percent
4057690 from a store owner perspective you get to talk to a ton of fans and get to talk about what you think can happen

4057692 right now we plan to stay open until november but well be living here year round
4057693 who knows what might happen were just playing it by ear

4057695 we would have to go back to the town for approval then wed use the lower level for the living area

4057699 so far im having a good time the people staying here have been wonderful its been very pleasant
4057700 i dont do a lot for myself id rather be helping others
4057701 you go over to some of the places in africa that we work with and you have people there that are pretty much living in a home made of cardboard or living on a dollar or two a day
4057702 by world standards americans are wealthy and so you go over there and one of the things they have to get used to is that they are almost like superheroes or a walking wallet
4057703 i still kind a think i might be going to college in the fall a lot of my friends are though
4057704 with the long lra war some students now find killing normal head teachers should know that strikes in schools starting of gangs and squads are not disciplinary but security issues to be handled by security operatives
4057705 members and the leaders of such groups should be arrested because they are operating illegal societies anybody who wants to run a group should register with the authorities

4057711 after years of violence we finally realized that al qaeda was only here to destroy our city
4057712 the relationship between the sos and isf in samarra is the best in all of iraq
4057713 from the beginning the americans were very serious about it
4057714 with all due respect to the coalition forces it was the sahwa movement that brought the most security to the city today is the safest samarra has been since al qaeda arrived in 2004
4057715 please pass along a message to your government from me tell them to do everything they can to get my boys hired into the iraqi security forces if they dont get hired they will go back to being jobless and we go back to the starting point
4057716 what bothers me is the mismatch between what they have to play with viz a distinctly non interactive non webby pm and the choices they made
4057717 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
4057718 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
4057719 according to labour laws an officers services is automatically terminated without notice when he is bound by contract and fails to turn up for work for five consecutive days
4057720 our findings suggest that many former child soldiers may need more than interventions to reduce the mental health problems associated with surviving bombings and torture often they have to endure being stigmatized when they return to their home villages
4057721 these findings suggest that there is something else in addition to war trauma that is causing problems for the former child soldiers
4057722 one hypothesis is that the reintegration process puts added stress on them
4057723 i want a career that allows me to do evidence based research and provide mental health care to those in the most desperate need
4057724 the parkinsons and mental health education project has clearly identified the need for health and social care professionals to increase their understanding of parkinsons and related mental health issues the pds is keen to use this information to design a specific training programme to help professionals find practical ways to help their patients have the best quality of life and the upcoming conference is a good place to begin

4057735 in the beginning quake live will be completely ad supported its not out of the question that eventually well have some kind of a premium service
4057736 but we dont know what its going to be yet and were certainly going out with the completely free to play model as the community grows and we start seeing what people actually want to get out of it we may offer some other things there
4057737 there could be a huge possible range of successes that we could see on here
4057738 and if quake live does well we could end up keeping people on here indefinitely growing the community polishing things up adding new content as long as it can be supportable like that

4057740 lower volumes despite stable to higher shares in all markets
4057741 our 2q results were better than 1q as anticipated but still below our aspirations
4057742 the main market where we have underperformed so far this year has been russia where our value and price brands have lost share at a faster pace than we have been gaining share with our core and premium brands as evidenced by net sales per hectolitre growth of 12
4057743 our overall pricing is healthy but rising costs continue to put pressure on our margins
4057744 i finally get to the point where im making 150 grand and they want to put my name and address on the form so the lawyer next door who makes a million dollars a year can laugh at me
4057745 a hundred and fifty thousand here is not the same as it is in dubuque iowa or west texas

4057755 tim needs to go at least six innings brad is a bull he pitched complete games all year for winnacunnet high school and he pitched a big one for us in the state tournament
4057756 if we pitch and play defense like we did in the state tournament well be ok itll depend on how deep our pitching goes
4057757 i need to have him play second base because im not going to dh him for tim or brad when theyre pitching
4057758 jack was a great outfielder in high school but he didnt hit real well
4057759 but coming into legion the kids picked him up and he has responded his offense has been my biggest surprise
4057760 when you go up there its not like they put a number on you saying youre hitting fourth today
4057761 weve known about him as a hitter but now hes added some power
4057762 he comes to play hard he come up with big hits
4057763 youre never going to replace any guy on this team you just try to manage when theyre gone
4057764 last night we were able to make it up but tonight you cant keep expecting to try to make that up
4057765 we made it a little more interesting than we needed to
4057766 obviously were not going to know today or tomorrow the length of the thing well let him get treatment hopefully its quicker than not
4057767 the obvious thing that comes to mind was the hgh thing in the morning that was a really tough day for me
4057768 the other thing was the tough loss with the red sox celebrating on the field we had a 3 1 lead in the series going into the locker room and having grown men crying
4057769 im excited to be going to a team with a lot of pressure the alternative is going to a team where the games dont count im excited i love the pressure i want to pitch in a world series ive never pitched in a world series
4057770 i started praying i wanted to stay in the game
4057771 we twijfelen er niet aan dat die vrouw het meent en begaan is en we voelen ook wel een gepaste trots maar we hebben ook angst dat het iets meer wordt dan een eerbetoon
4057772 we zijn bang dat er zich rondom een ander spelletje gaat afspelen dat ook rusland een offici le vertegenwoordiger wil sturen dat er een mediacircus ontstaat we wilden eigenlijk een besloten uitvaart maar we weten dat dat niet kan
4057773 all six girls are exceptional i like them all i love them all
4057774 certain countries go by rules and certain countries do not
4057775 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4057776 look pretty young but i dont look 20 so im not one to judge
4057777 he is just another person but maybe from a different planet
4057778 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4057779 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4057780 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4057781 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4057782 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4057783 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4057784 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4057785 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4057786 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4057787 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4057788 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4057789 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4057790 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4057793 and the water was 64 degrees so that was a blessing
4057794 ecco tu sei esattamente la mia dose preferita di eroina lt 3
4057795 my wife and i started the club three years ago
4057796 there was a core of us that started doing it pretty seriously and competing regularly
4057797 two years ago we decided to create something to give us a collective identity at races and a forum for group training
4057798 we have low key competitors and beginners all the way to accomplished triathletes we all get together and share our experiences if nothing else its an opportunity for the social aspect of getting people together who have a similar interest
4057799 its not so much competition to match someone elses performance
4057800 but if there are four or five people going to a race you might say ill go too
4057801 without a doubt some folks are quite competitive with one another it may be unstated but its pretty obvious
4057802 we do all three events but in shortened form we swim a couple of hundred yards bike 10 miles and run a couple of miles were open to anyone who wants to join

4057808 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
4057809 will something be done ahead of the second leg certainly yes but before saturday no
4057810 if you look at the number of players we had out you can say it was very positive for us
4057811 we did not have diaby fabregas rosicky nasri kolo toure eduardo and senderos while song is at the olympics
4057812 we missed seven or eight players out so for me our squad looks big because the players who were here did well
4057813 the answer to our midfield crsis is staring at us in the face mr wenger get out the cheque book and get robbie savage to put pen to paper and quickly if not danny murphy
4057814 yes it has finished there will be no further progress
4057815 we have got a lot of work to do we are still trying to get players in
4057816 we are hoping to bring a couple more in before saturday then we have a couple of weeks to move people in and one or two people will leave as well
4057817 we have been linked with loads of players if we can do it we will do it if we cant we cant
4057818 amdy has trained with us and he has been smashing
4057819 a bid came in last night and it was immediately rejected
4057820 various manchester city officials have been advised on a number of occasions that the player would not be for sale
4057821 we are very disappointed therefore that they have continued their interest

4057841 geraldine somerville conferma il suo ruolo di lily ne i doni della morte
4057842 we know we got some good character guys and good players i just want to help the franchise move forward and we feel with the draft we know we picked up two good guys that our fans are going to be very supportive of and excited about
4057843 i think larry and general manager david morway did an outstanding job in changing around our basketball team both with the trades and the picks
4057844 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
4057845 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4057846 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4057847 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
4057848 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
4057849 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
4057850 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
4057851 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
4057852 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
4057853 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
4057854 sex with a little energy and imagination provides a workout worthy of an athlete
4057855 provides scant consolation given that julys business surveys so far point to a second consecutive fall in the third quarter
4057856 we now expect the eurozone economy to expand at an annual average rate of 1 2 percent this year compared to our previous forecast for a 1 7 percent rise
4057857 the french economy is not going through merely a soft spot but is really in the process of driving into a recession at least as serious as the one in 1993
4057858 rises in the prices of raw materials weakness of the dollar
4057859 overall these figures raise a real question of economic policy for europeans
4057860 the united states created the crisis and it is europe which has the recession we come back to the same essential question how do we strengthen the potential for growth in the euroland economy
4057861 there is cause for worry gross domestic product is falling back consumption stagnating service activity weakening employment worsening households have the blues and businesses are doubtful
4057862 in this context lets be honest the third quarter is already compromised
4057863 no he didnt ive improved only in the last year
4057864 i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten
4057865 it really affected my performance because the rain made my gun slippery and i missed several targets
4057866 i looked back and could see the second carriage on an angle after i stopped i didnt realise the full extent i knew the truck hit me
4057867 i went towards the rear of the train a bloke come towards me he informed me the people in the third carriage were dead
4057868 all of a sudden i saw the truck hit everything just went everywhere
4057869 the front of the truck flew up into the air then i saw the carriage of the train coming past opened up like a tin
4057870 he was trying his hardest to get off the road
4057871 the lost revenue could be made up in three ways through higher income taxes reduced government services or more borrowing which would pass the burden of current government spending to future generations
4057872 i have already seen lots of wildlife bullfrogs dragonflies chipmunks deer squirrels and bass in my pond we are watching a robins nest from our upstairs window cedar waxwings gather every afternoon in trees and bushes above our pond when the sun is shining on the pond they fly out above the pond and catch bugs and fly back into the trees to eat them sometimes several will fly out at the same time after the same bug its quite amazing to watch
4057873 i had something unusual the other morning i looked out at my feeders in my garden and theres always quail out there i looked at one and thought gee thats a big quail it was all fluffed up and in the shadows and i took a closer look and it was a chukar there were four chukars in my yard and theyve been here the last two or three days i dont know if someone raised them around here but i was amazed to see these chukars wandering around in my garden and my yard
4057874 the bullocks orioles have left weve had a bunch of them here surprisingly i had probably three nesting pair here in my trees and they quit feeding on my nectar feeders and took out of here about all we have now are a bunch of black headed grosbeaks and were overloaded with american finches on our pond we always have a green heron and a great blue here every day plus a bunch of wood ducks that nested here they have their young so theyre pretty wary they see us coming and they go to the far end of the pond and get in the brush weve been here not quite two years and counting those chukar that makes 61 different species of birds that ive identified here i enjoy watching them
4057875 de verdachte gedurende die twee jaar een intensieve behandeling ondergaat
4057876 its quite a historic piece meet me under the clock
4057877 it was just a place to meet meet under the clock
4057878 i asked for it and they gave it to me
4057879 someone who has a memory of meier amp frank surely
4057880 i think it would be some sort of business or a building of some kind
4057881 some person who is interested in salem history and has a building
4057882 id love that to be in salem to be a part of downtown
4057883 it was a tradition it was in the store for 52 years
4057884 when we took it down there were a lot of complaints
4057885 we match up pretty good against ukraine weve beaten them mostly in the past
4057886 thats not common but the team competition is very different from the individual
4057887 we will monitor the staffing levels not only for custodial and maintenance but for all our employee groups
4057888 i would never want to single out one place in the district to say we definitely have to increase here
4057889 youve got a half a billion dollars youre spending every year
4057890 you have enough money for a custodial staff thats adequate
4057891 were getting back as much as possible to the level we were 10 years ago
4057892 what were trying to do is get building staff to a level that we can really maintain the buildings
4057893 that has lead to some of our difficulties with deferred maintenance
4057894 im amazed at the amount of work that is getting done
4057895 while we would like to be at the defined industry standard were making it happen
4057896 were in a better place today than we were yesterday
4057897 we want to get to the point where we do more preventative maintenance
4057898 right now were putting out fires even with adding staff were putting out fires
4057899 we cant get out nearly as much as we used to
4057900 to some peoples surprise facilities problems are less a function of geography or socioeconomics and more directly related to staff levels training and practices all of which can be controlled by the organization
4057901 a lot of our work is small things like that
4057902 the door should be replaced but we keep doing things like this to keep them operating because of lack of funding we keep making repairs and keep coming back
4057903 we keep it working but because of a lack of manpower we dont do preventative maintenance
4057904 i do the maintenance up to the point where i cant do it anymore
4057905 we continue to evaluate the childrens needs and are in the process of reviewing several placement resources for the children
4057906 heck yeah you can have hamsters if it only costs me 5 and there is virtually no maintenance involved
4057907 i dont want to say there is a magic solution here i am not going to provide false promises i am not going to provide false guarantees about there being some simple solution
4057908 i am trying to turn around a situation which has evolved over many many years and we are dealing with the real consequences of climate change
4057909 theres been some challenge to the accuracy of the murray darling commission numbers
4057910 we will commission one of the independent accounting houses of the world to separately and independently audit the accuracy of the murray darling basin commissions numbers
4057911 at the start of the week locky walked over and i turned to the boys and said who is this bloke
4057912 they said he was some young kid from roma who was apparently pretty sharp
4057913 i didnt know him and i remember looking at them and saying are you guys serious
4057914 he came on in the 50th minute and i think we were up 40 10 and he did three or four unbelievable things
4057915 i looked at steve renouf and said darren lockyer remember that name because its going to go a long way
4057916 id put him up their with joey and alfie as the best ive ever played with and ive played with some greats
4057917 as a player he is one of the greats but as a mate and what he brings to the game you couldnt ask for anything more
4057918 his comments the other day about owing rugby league so much and that he would never play rugby union typifies the person he is
4057919 great players keep evolving and pound for pound there arent any tougher players
4057920 the kiwis used to try and rough him up all the time before tests but he was that tough it never worked
4057921 just being injured this year hes shown what a marvellous competitor he is to get back and be part of the team
4057922 rugby league needs to hang onto him hes one of a kind
4057923 he is my mate and wayne bennett has been influential in my career
4057924 but at the of the day you want nothing more than to go to suncorp and cause an upset
4057925 if that happens ill be one of the first to walk into the dressing room to congratulate him lockyer on such a great feat so far
4057926 im sure hell be up for a big game back at suncorp for the first time
4057927 its a really big game for us with locky breaking the record
4057928 itll be a great atmosphere and thats the environment he loves
4057929 our back row will be a little smaller without tc carroll and eastwood but david stagg and corey parker will be there and were still going to have some big guys coming off the bench
4057930 well miss a little bit of his impact but well make up for that with staggy and corey going 80 minutes
4057931 hes been one of their form players and you take one of them out of any side and it detracts from your performance
4057932 were glad hes not playing but its not a major issue
4057933 its not going to win us or lose us a game
4057934 australia is concerned that despite the announcement of a ceasefire agreement which commits both sides to a cessation of all hostilities and the withdrawal of troops to positions held before the conflict broke out there have been reports of ongoing military action by russian forces
4057935 australia calls on russia to honour the terms of the ceasefire respect the territorial integrity of georgia and resolve its differences with georgia through peaceful means
4057936 the military action taken by russia has been disproportionate and has resulted in widespread damage and heavy casualties
4057937 the humanitarian package that we have embraced there is important we believe in terms of the immediate needs of the people affected by the recent military activities between russia and the georgian state
4057938 australians always step in pitch in to help where we can
4057939 this is a long way from australia but this is an appalling war because of the effect on innocent civilians and i support fully the actions of president sarkozy of france in trying to bring about a peaceful resolution to this
4057940 a further 500 000 has been allocated to the international committee of the red cross icrc for the immediate provision of medical supplies to hospitals and the deployment of field hospitals for critical surgery in gori and south ossetia
4057941 i think it would be a real tragedy if he didnt play here as long as he possibly could
4057942 id love darren to keep playing for the broncos in 2010 2011 and then maybe get on the coaching staff
4057943 im sure hed be a good coach i think he is thinking along those lines and i think that is what he wants to do
4057944 it would be a wonderful thing for him to move into that role especially at this club
4057945 darren is very honest bloke hes very team oriented and he cares a lot about this place
4057946 sam thaiday is off contract greg eastwoods off contract and dave taylor is off contract
4057947 i dont know whats going to happen with those guys and what kind of money will get freed up
4057948 theres still a lot of things to be played out before now and then
4057949 and if you look at the sonny bill thing players can get an offer and come and ask for a release
4057950 that might happen so yes theres a possibility we can keep both of them but well have to wait until april or may next year to find out
4057951 i havent really even thought about semi final football we have only thought about playing next week and thats the way weve been all year
4057952 everyone sort of expects us to fail so i think its sort of a little bit of pressure off
4057953 no one really gives us any credit anymore so were just going through doing what we do and hopefully come october were still in the mix
4057954 i suppose thats got to add to your confidence theyre not unbeatable
4057955 both teams have been beaten recently so theres no reason why on our day we cant turn up and beat those teams
4057956 you just go back to the tigers a couple of years ago they definitely werent the best team in the comp probably all year until semi final time they started turning a bit on and really put the sword to a few teams
4057957 theres no reason why we cant be mixing it with these teams and doing a similar thing
4057958 i watched that game last friday night and it was high flying from both teams the confrontations from the manly forwards and the skill of the melbourne backs
4057959 it was a pretty enjoyable game to watch and you compare that to any other game over the weekend i think a lot of teams are off the pace compared to those two teams
4057960 but theres a long way to go before the semis its another four weeks so im sure that a lot of teams can turn that around
4057961 this was an heroic action by australian troops against overwhelming odds comprised of north vietnamese regulars
4057962 it is absolutely right that we display appropriate recognition for the heroism so displayed and i am glad it has now occurred
4057963 im very pleased that finally justice has been done mainly for my soldiers because it was them who actually fought face to face with the enemy
4057964 they fought over and above what would be expected of young national service soldiers with very little experience
4057965 they repelled wave after wave of assaulting suicidal attacks and not one of the enemy got inside our position thanks to them
4057966 it was just sad that we lost 18 soldiers that day
4057967 hes one guy weve really spoken about at the end of the day it will probably be a medical decision but the coach is pretty keen for him to play
4057968 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4057969 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4057970 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4057971 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4057972 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4057973 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4057974 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4057975 despite the previously reached agreement russians are deploying additional forces in gori and fortifying the city at the same time russian armed forces have returned to poti
4057976 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
4057977 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4057978 in recent days there have been several instances of pillaging yesterday our police executed two pillagers on the scene
4057979 today we plan to be tougher in addressing this problem

4057983 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4057984 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4057985 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4057986 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4057987 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4057988 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

4057996 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4057997 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4057998 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4057999 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4058000 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4058001 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4058002 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
4058003 for us to break the record by so far is amazing i really look forward to sitting back and cheering for the aussies
4058004 i did my best and ran out of room at the end
4058005 im a little bit tired and i have a full day to recover
4058006 i cant believe it after the relay i could have sunk but i told myself that after all these years of hard work i cant let myself go down my legs were shaking at the start i was really tense just like the other seven guys
4058007 to bounce back from that relay takes a lot of guts and he showed that today
4058008 full credit to him he swam a better race and the better man won on the day
4058009 the most important thing is being able to separate the two events and just move on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me in the psychological part
4058010 its a new generation and its now time to step aside they did a great job im from the previous generation
4058011 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue
4058012 so to go out there and accomplish a medal is really exciting it doesnt top the relay medal but its something ive been pushing for for four years
4058013 we were a very young team and we did not lose our nerve did not panic and in the end maybe our technical superiority allowed us to score two goals that is a massive advantage for the second leg but we will be on our toes

4058022 if the constituent assembly has been convened it has plenary powers i dont think you can limit by law what the constituent assembly can take up
4058023 the implication of some statements of administration people is that you need to shift to federalism in order to give effect to the peace agreement there is no such thing because the adoption of a federal system for the entire government is not necessary
4058024 you just change those provisions and give more power to the autonomous region and call it bangsamoro homeland provision without touching other provisions of the constitution
4058025 why is it that some people are saying that ou cannot possibly implement the moa memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain with the moro islamic liberation front without changing the entire system to a federal government that is misleading

4058029 theyre accusing the president of using the federalism as an excuse to tinker with the constitution so she can stay longer in malaca ang but what they are not telling us is that they want her out of the way by june 2010 so they can replace her
4058030 they want the president to go as scheduled so they can replace her as they planned whats good for our nation should not be hindered by anyones ambition

4058059 so did america leave us any choice with this flagrant aggression
4058060 no doubt that the answer is going to be no therefore it became our right and our duty to push away with all our strength this crusade campaign and declare clearly that the american interests are legitimate targets to us
4058061 there isnt a big concern because the important american interests in the south are heavily secured and very difficult to access
4058062 likewise the u s diplomatic corps is in a bunker as they are in all arab countries thirdly there simply arent very many american tourists here so in my opinion the chances of the gspc successfully attacking american interests in algeria are practically zero
4058063 the gspc in 2001 it had about 5 000 to 6 000 members but several years later it had only about 1 000 fighters

4058108 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger im pact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the black out
4058109 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and is sues around using too much or too little energy
4058110 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any linger ing effects in reduced consump tion from the blackout
4058111 the individual customers out there i believe want to help

4058286 stay the hell away from me until you can provide substantial and incontrovertable proof either i want to see for myself that christ denied all other faiths in favor of his own teachings which was more pauls doing than christs or i want to see a body if god is dead provide the corpse if there is no unmoved mover give me solid empirical evidence until then sit down and shut up

4058289 bambaaaannggg ya ampun mbang baru jadi pembantu saja sudah susah kalau dibutuhkan gimana nanti kalau jadi presiden
4058290 kalian dengar suara itu tua dan purba kalian bisa merasakan begitu lembut bersijengkat lembut mendatangimu
4058291 bambaaangg cepet ambilkan jas saya mereka pasti sudah menunggu saya
4058292 saya mengira minggu ternyata rabu sering saya mendapati diri saya berada di waktu yang salah
4058293 tapi ngomongmu nggak usah bergaya begitu dong sok diangker angkerin malah kayak film hantu persis uka uka
4058294 eeeh malah memaki saya kutuk jadi presiden indonesia mampus kamu
4058295 lho iya kan jadi presiden indonesia itu seperti dapat kutukan kok apa sih enaknya jadi presiden indonesia coba di indonesia profesi presiden itu profesi yang sama sekali tidak menarik dari dulu kerjanya ya gitu gituuuu melulu selalu nyusahin rakyat makanya kalau kalian termasuk golongan orang kreatif tolong deh nggak usah punya cita cita jadi presiden indonesia malah nanti kelihatan bodonya jadi presiden indonesia itu sama sekali tidak menarik
4058296 tugas kewajiban dan tanggung jawab presiden indonesia itu monoton kok dari tahun ke tahun siapa pun yang jadi presiden ya tugasnya tetap sama meningkatkan angka pengangguran menambah jumlah devi apa devisit uang negara mencari pijaman luar negeri sembari menikmati hasil komisinya menaikan harga bbm menyelenggarakan busung lapar di mana mana sama sekali nggak kreatif kan mbosenin saya ngomong gitu bukan karena saya dengki nggak jadi presiden lho
4058297 hiiihhh saya nggak mau jadi presiden apaan tuh presiden jijey aku emoh jangankan presiden indonesia ditawarin jadi raja hastina saja saya tidak mau kok emoh padahal romo semar sendiri lho yang nawarin katanya saya ini lebih pantas jadi raja hastina ketimbang yusdhistira si pandawa paling tua itu
4058298 saya ingat betul kok waktu itu itu jaman ketika belum ada kerajaan kerajaan di jawa tapi saya sudah ada sudah tua dan imut seperti ini sudah metroseksual kayak gini waktu itu terjadi krisis di hastina karena pandawa kalah main dadu saat itulah romo semar langsung tergopoh gopoh menemui saya
4058299 saya ini terlalu low profile untuk dijadikan pemimpin itulah sebabnya dulu saya sempet berantem sama gajah mada karena saya menolak membantunya padahal kami temen sepermainan sejak kecil temen gaul gitu loh suka main gundu dan mencuri buah maja sama sama
4058300 ya ngintip perempuan mandi nggak nyangka kan orang yang doyan ngintip begitu bisa menyatukan nusantara
4058301 si gajah mada mau ngintip nih ia mengendap endap sembunyi di balik belukar dan pepohonan persis jaka tarub ngintip bidadari mandi saya ngikut dibelakangnya gemeteran takut ketahuan saya bilang mad mad mada kita pulang saja yuk tapi dia tak mau dia malah naik ke pohon
4058302 itulah sebabnya seperti pada gambar di buku sejarah yang sering kalian lihat gajah mada bengkak wajahnya
4058303 bener bener punya bakat jadi presiden dia kagak dengar meski sudah diteriakin alias budeg kata orang budeg itu memang penyakit permanen presiden
4058304 saya kan sudah bilang semua mesti rapi biar saya tidak bingung begini dibilangin dari dulu eh tetap nggak didengerin apa sih susahnya ndengerin dibilangin baik baik eh malah ngata ngatain dasar tukang kritik sirik saya ngritik bukan karna sirik saya ngritik karena saya ingin semuanya baik hingga hidup bertambah baik kan enak kalau semua kelihatan baik saya nggak seneng kalau kamu jorok baju kotor jangan kayak seniman celana dalem lima minggu sekali baru ganti
4058305 dikritik memang sakit itu tak seberapa sebab orang yang suka mengritik itu justru lebih merasa sakit bila kritiknya nggak didengerin
4058306 kalian lihat sendiri kan dia selalu menyepelekan saya tapi saya tetep sabar
4058307 sakiiittt ati saya sakit sakit sakitttttt kit kik kit kadang saya pikir buat apa saya teriak teriak marah begitu buat apa saya terus terusan mengritik kadang saya merasa lelah juga kok jadi tukang kritik saya pingin berhenti mengritik tapi kalau berhenti mengritik saya sendiri yang malah sakit baru semenit tidak mengritik mulut saya langsung pegel pegel sehari tidak mengritik langsung bisulan pantat saya
4058308 yaah barangkali memang beginilah resiko jadi orang yang sudah terlanjur dicap sebagai tukang kritik
4058309 apa salah saya saya selalu tulus mengritik kalian tapi kenapa kalian memperlakukan saya begini
4058310 bambaaaannggg obat saya obat saya tolong air bam banggg bammmmbaaannggg
4058311 nasibnya akan sama seperti para tukang kritik lainnya pingsan di kursi kekuasaan
4058312 aku tak menyerah pada takdir karena tak ingin jadi kentir
4058313 tapi aku tak menyerah seperti dia yang juga tak menyerah seperti semua tukang kritik yang hidup sepanjang sejarah
4058314 tukang kritik tak lebih cuma kaum munafik munafik munafik munafik
4058315 yaa sebenarnya dari dulu sih tuan saya itu orangnya membingunkan saking membingungkannya sampai sampai saya juga ikut bingung
4058316 tuan saya orangnya eksentrik kerjanya nyalahin orang ada ajah yang diomelin inilah itulah saya dikatain ginilah gitulah
4058317 yang nyebelin nanti kalau udah saya beresin tetep ajah saya diomelin
4058318 begitulah tuan saya di dunia ini nggak ada yang bener dimatanya
4058319 kalian bisa bayangkan bagaimana stressnya saya jadi pembantu raden mas suhikayatno sengaro mulyo ini sejak kecil saya jadi pembantu di sini bapak saya juga jadi pembantu di sini kakek saya juga simbah buyut saya
4058320 jadi trah saya itu trah pembantu asli orisinil darah saya itu darah murni seorang pembantu kalau di dunia sihir saya ini disebut penyihir murni bukan penyihir keturunan
4058321 kadang saya ini merasa nggak jauh beda kok sama para priyayi raja raja itu
4058322 tapi ya ada senengnya juga kok jadi pembantunya raden mas suhikayatno ini beliau itu orang hebat dia itu
4058323 dia itu terkenal banget sebagai tukang kritik nomor wahid banyak versi cerita seputar sosoknya kisah kelahirannya saja ada lebih 1 501 versi ada yang mengisahkan ia lahir dari bonggol pisang ada yang bilang ia muncul begitu saja dari kabut waktu tapi ada juga bilang dia itu anak hasil kawin silang manusia dan genderuwo
4058324 kalau dilihat dari tampangnnya ada benernya juga sih cerita itu serba tanggung cakep enggak buruk iya setengah manusia setengah makhkuk sengsara beda jauh kan sama saya bahkan ada yang percaya
4058325 hmmm kalau hawa apa ya oh ya hawa itu maksudnya hamid hawaludin
4058326 itu kata kakek saya lho ya saya sih percaya pecaya saja lagi pula kalau dirunut secara etimologi ilmu gotak gatuk ada benernya juga kok socrates sok krates asal katanya sok dan protes sok protes nah raden mas suhikayatno ini kan juga seneng protes jadi antara socrates dan suhikayatno bisa jadi emang orang yang sama yah minimal namanya sama sama berawalan s menurut sahibul hikayat raden mas suhikayatno ini memang dikenal memiliki banyak nama dia pernah dikenal sebagai gallileo di perancis dia dipanggil voltaire tapi begitu di jawa dipanggil empu gandring lalu jadi gandhi waktu di india kata kakek saya lagi mereka memang berbeda nama tapi lihat apa yang mereka lakukan mereka semua sesungguhnya orang yang sama
4058327 iya juga sih tapi gimana nalarnya ya dari gandring kok jadi gandhi
4058328 nama raden mas suhikayatno ini juga meragukan kok ini nama beneran atau nama jadi jadian
4058329 yah anda kan tahu yang namanya legenda pasti banyak nggak masuk akalnya apalagi ini legenda menyangkut seorang tokoh tahu sendirilah
4058330 saya nggak menghinanya lho bagaimana pun saya hormat kok sama beliau memang dia suka banget ngritik tapi pada dasarnya dia baik kok kalau dirasa rasa terasa betul kok kebenaran dalam kritik kritiknya
4058331 sebagai tukang kritik majikan saya itu pada dasarnya ya memang baik kok
4058332 bisa berabe kalau yang jadi presiden pertama dia kalau sukarno sih memang pantes namanya cocok buat jadi presiden
4058333 su kar no terdengar enak ditelingakalau dalam upacara kenegaraan ya kedengaran gagah inilah presiden pertama kita sukarno no no no terdengar enak kalu dikasih
4058334 kita yang ndenger saja jadi tersayat sayat kayat ka yat nama apa itu bener bener nama yang amat sangat tidak nasionalistis
4058335 lagi pula nama kayat kan berbau kekiri kirian ka yat kedengaran seperti rak yat jenis nama nama yang bisa membawa nasib buruk buat para pemiliknya
4058336 saya ingat empat tahun lalu tepatnya tahun 2008 ya tahun 2008 kira kira 8 bulan sebelum penyenggaraan pemilu raden mas suhikayatno diminta jadi pimpinan kpu tapi dia nggak mau takut terlibat karupsi berjamaah seperti kpu periode sebelumnya saat pemilihan presiden tahun 2009 beliau juga diminta jadi wakil sby soalnya jusuf kala maju sendiri jadi capres didukung partai golkar waktu itu memang banyak pengamat yang bilang kalau majikan saya dan sby itu pasangan ideal lebih cocok begitu ya setidaknya dibanding wakil sby sebelumnya yang dianggap terlalu kreatif dan terlalu banyak inisiatif
4058337 saya sih nggak terlalu ngerti politik nggak tahulah gimana kelanjutannya yang jelas pada pemilihan presiden tahun 2009 itu pemenangnya adalah calon yang didukung partai panji tengkorak yakni butet kertaredjasa inilah pertama kalinya seorang seniman berhasil menjadi presiden di indonesia
4058338 tahu nggak apa program pertama butet kertaredjasa sebagai presiden mengganti nama nama jalan nama jalan yang tadinya dipenuhi nama tentara diganti dengan nama para seniman jalan gatot subroto diganti menjadi jalan sapardi djoko damono jalan s parman diganti jalan s bagio pokoknnya semua jalan diberi nama seniman dari jalan tol jalan tembus sampai jalan buntu bahkan jalan taman lawang juga diganti menjadi jalan djaduk ferianto 6 hanya satu nama jalan yang tidak di ganti yakni jalan gajah mada karena gajah mada itu teman sepermainan majikan saya
4058339 saya yakin ini tahun 3050 samar samar saya melihat bayangan bertumpuk tumpuk
4058340 aduh maaf tuan sumpah nggak sengaja mijit yang itu saya kira tangan tuan tapi kok lembek aduuhhh sakit tuan aduhhhh

4058346 jangan salah faham ya saya ini nyuruh turun bambang pembantu saya
4058347 maaf saya bukannya mau mengungkit ungkit tapi hargai dong sejarah saya apa dikira tukang kritik macam saya nggak menyumbangkan apa apa bagaimana jadinya bangsa ini kalau nggak ada orang macam saya sayalah yang memulai sejarah orang macam sayalah yang menggerakkan sejarah orang orang yang berani menyampaikan kritik waktu negeri ini masih dijajah kumpeni kalian pikir siapa yang berani sama kumpeni

4058349 ini sejarah bung kebenaran paling kecil pun harus ditulis saya tak ingin sejarah kita penuh kebohongan meski banyak yang bilang sejarah sesungguhnya tidak lebih dari berbagai macam versi kebohongan
4058350 tidakkah kalian ingat di tahun 1995 lebih limabelas tahun lampau di zaman soeharto ketika semua bungkam tukang kritik seperti sayalah yang mempertaruhkan nyawa ketika koran dan majalah di

4058382 as a company committed to remaining in new zealand we see this purchase as part of our ongoing strategy of growth and investment here
4058383 s wasserquallen wie sie derzeit in der alten donau vorkommen sind f r den menschen in keiner weise gef hrlich und haben auch nichts mit einer mangelhaften wasserqualit t zu tun
4058384 im gegenteil die wasserqualit t der alten donau ist heuer besonders gut
4058385 if you were to get really sick tomorrow i am talking sick as in lupus cancer rheumatoid arthritis idiopathic intracranial hypertension im trying to look really intelligent here ok just dont get me pronouncing it or became disabled tomorrow how will you answer the following questions
4058386 do you have courage are you courageous are you brave not to you no you are just doing what you do to us you are amazing
4058387 we have to be very careful because they have been beaten by us on a few occasions up here in big games in croke park but the reality is that they gave us a good hiding below in pairc ui chaoimh
4058388 i wouldnt say that we will forget about it the munster final because you have to know that it happened it did happen and thats the reality of it the fact of that matter is that it only happened two months ago
4058389 we are in a semi final now and the reality is also that we are just 70 minutes away from a place in the final
4058390 its a great win for us as a team we could have easily thrown our hats at it when we went down two points and then you had the rain it was getting dark and the referees calls were going against us
4058391 i think daniel bohane did an excellent job coming in at full back and he real ly gave us a foothold in the game all of a sudden when the ball was coming in it was coming back out and that gave us the confidence then
4058392 i think gooch had a big part to play as well i dont how much he scored but when things got really tight i think he was our trump card really
4058393 it is coming on sure we have only been at it for a month really we are still getting to know each other but i thought he was very dominant on saturday
4058394 he is an amazing guy the pressure was on him again but he came out won the first ball drove past three or four guys and knocked it over the bar
4058395 to finish up with three points in the first half when i wasnt have it all my own way is some going and its great to have someone to carry the can for you
4058396 i enjoyed refereeing and would encourage more players to stay it up when they finish playing
4058397 i saw some great players in my time and made so many friends on and off the field
4058398 i genuinely set out to wrong no one and be as fair as i could and i was never abused by players on the field to any extend as i believed in talking and calming situations down rather than throwing petrol on a volatile fuse
4058399 s pat oshea was next to come before the awaiting media and one of the first questions that came his way concerned kerrys concession of 1 16
4058400 it would be an area where we would like to try and tighten up on
4058401 thats a big score to concede but we were up against one of the best forward lines in the country there are probably very few teams in the country that have the scoring power that galway possess they are very potent and can score from many areas
4058402 we always felt that they could put up that type of scores
4058403 it probably was our best game of the season the championship is funny isnt it
4058404 when you really play a tough hard game its only then that you find out what you are made of unfortunately up to now in the games that we have had we probably havent been asked those serious questions about ourselves
4058405 in the knock out stages and in the second half on saturday when galway went or two points up we did look in trouble but to a man our lads responded
4058406 it was a fantastic second half performance from both teams
4058407 it was a very very good game even though the conditions made it almost impossible
4058408 the scores that were got in the second half were a testament to the players that were out there we dont talk enough really about the players that we have playing our games
4058409 we dont appreciate enough what players have to go through the pressure at this time of the year i cant speak highly enough about both sets of players especially our own
4058410 joe bergin came in and his introduction was vital for galway
4058411 we had a situation with michael cussen in the munster final so we assume that teams will try to target us in certain areas
4058412 we have a number of options that can play there and we felt that daniel was best suited thankfully from our point of view he did it was a big ask of him to go in at a vital stage
4058413 we would have had the greatest respect for galway they are probably the purest footballers in the country
4058414 i always want to see south kerry take part in the senior county championship hurling but we have to have the support of the clubs
4058415 i cant wait for the game against cork but this is not about us trying to exact revenge because of what happened in the munster final
4058416 that game was over six weeks ago now and we have learnt valuable lessons from that encounter we will make sure that our own house is in order and obviously we will want to improve on how we played against galway
4058417 we did well in fits and bursts but we want to be more consistent and thats what we will be working on
4058418 we know all about cork from the munster final and we know just how good a team they are so we will give them all the respect they deserve because they have earned it
4058419 the department declined our request that the three women be kept on in their jobs
4058420 we are currently awaiting a response from the minster responsible mary hanafin in relation to the request
4058421 we are of the opinion that the department is in breach of regulations relating to the transfer of undertakings
4058422 i dont think this case will be solved overnight but we hope that something can be done
4058423 s admitted that the three ina row chasing stars are still smarting from the munster final defeat to cork
4058424 we are all learning no matter how much experience that we have and we are still learning from that cork defeat
4058425 we will take nothing for granted from here on in i would always believe the theory that if you are knocked out of the championship you should be gone
4058426 we have a second chance and we are making all we can out of it hope fully we can get better from this one again
4058427 s brothers on the team along with darragh and marc tom s feels kerrys experience was crucial in the second half
4058428 we came out after half time ahead then went a few points down but i think it is down to experience as well we kept plugging away kept the heads down and we knew that we would get the chances and the lads took all the chances that they got
4058429 s feels that this kerry side are a work in motion improving all the time
4058430 with the conditions it was always going to be tough
4058431 it started out open enough but when it started pouring it was always going to come down to who won the battle around the middle of the park i thought in the last 20 minutes that we stepped it up out there
4058432 when bergin came in the high ball caused us bother again so that is something for us to look at daniel bohane did very well when he came in came out with a couple of great balls
4058433 i think we defended very well in the last 10 15 minutes when it was need ed
4058434 the new website is an educational medium that can help to enlighten all of us on simple adjustments and initiatives that will reduce our carbon footprint while supporting our games
4058435 one of the reasons that i have stayed on as chairman for so long is that i wanted to wait until all our redevelopment work was complete and it is now
4058436 i have been involved in the development of the club since 1993 when we first purchased land but it has been tough over the years because at first we could only fit one full size pitch in the six and a half acre side
4058437 but we have worked hard over the years and now we have two full size pitches at our woodlawn grounds and that is something that all our members should be proud of
4058438 when we were pursuing the purchase of the land in 1993 i got vince involved with the fund raising and we have worked hand inhand over the years he has been a great servant to killarney athletic
4058439 i will never forget our 40th anniversary in 2005 because that was a special time for the club
4058440 some of athletics greatest members were there that day and it was an occasion to remember for everyone that involved
4058441 also its great to see that we have two irish internationals in brendan moloney and diarmuid ocarroll and we also were one of the first to introduce an underage system that some clubs still cant match
4058442 there have been plenty of highs and lows over the years but the 40th anniversary celebrations is one that stands out
4058443 i think it was a great dis play youd have to say we were very focussed and started very well we put offaly on the back foot and we got a few scores early on which is always good for the confidence
4058444 we created chances and we took them especially in the first half we got some great scores and we worked very hard all over the field once we got offaly on the back foot we didnt let them settle
4058445 we worked hard for breaking ball and wed have to say that we were very pleased with out first half performance
4058446 i think that we needed movement with fast ball going into our forwards i think that we improved a good bit from the replay against tipperary and well have to improve again for the semi final
4058447 but you know that in the second half if you want to look at a downside we created five or six chances that we didnt take maybe we kicked from beyond our comfort zone its something that well have to work on but overall were very pleased with a great team performance
4058448 we introduced four or five subs and they did well also it keeps players on their toes
4058449 there is a lot of competition for places i suppose that our strength in depth was illustrated today james odonoghue missed out because of injury which was very unfortunate
4058450 barry john keane came in and scored four points from play paul geaney came on and did quite well also so there is competition and thats the key thats what it is all about
4058451 theres no doubt about it going on training form can dip and rise and barry john seems to be on the up saturday will have done a lot for his confidence as indeed for all of them
4058452 so its going to be a difficult team to pick when james comes back into the frame for the semi final which he hopefully will
4058453 you have a lot of competition but thats what its all about the panel and the bench is the key in winning because its a 20 man game now and 15 wont win it for you
4058454 well you just have to look at the dvds and what we have to do is get our own house in order and get the lads playing to their potential
4058455 you need to know a little bit about them but you cant get obsessed with the opposition because if youre picking a team or have a game plan and something changes then all of a sudden its back to the drawing board again
4058456 declan was absolutely fantastic that game against monaghan really stood to him he hit four points and had a rocket come back off the post
4058457 he will only improve from this he missed the league and got injured again in the munster championship so i think that the hunger really showed in him
4058458 dan came on and did fantastic i think the boys did well on meehan because he is very hard to mark but in fairness the boys stuck at it when meehan gets the quality ball he is very hard to mark
4058459 in the second half we said that we had to put pressure on the outside ball to stop it coming in and i think that it helped the conditions didnt help either
4058460 there is no way that any player can take their foot off the pedal because if you do then you will be sitting in the sideline
4058461 if you are not performing in training then you wont get on the team
4058462 the monaghan game was the big one after the cork game the next game was always going to be important in fairness we training very hard ourselves and we had to lift it big time
4058463 i think that the monaghan game really stood to us coming into this game its onwards and upwards from here
4058464 players might have taken their eye off the ball a little bit and we all have to hold our hands up from one to 30 i think we concentrated a lot on intensity focus and concentration since then
4058465 we obviously didnt feel that what happened to laura was right she was different to other witnesses not incompetent she was well able to tell her story
4058466 its kelly vs ireland we have brought the case that lauras human rights were not upheld because there is no facility for an adult with special needs to give evidence
4058467 as everyone knows all these things proceed slowly its going to be at least 18 months so there is a long road ahead of us
4058468 what is going on in this country is an absolute disgrace
4058469 we would never have known what was happening if we hadnt been as unfortunate to experience what happened to laura
4058470 at this stage the result of the european case is not going to make any difference to laura but i dread any other family walking out of the courtroom like we did that day feeling the way we felt
4058471 the minister for justice dermot ahern said at the weekend that lauras was a difficult case but how many other difficult cases are out there how long is it going to take for them to do something about it
4058472 s has hailed the kerry win as extraordinary and when all elements especially the weather and the second half performance are considered the ventry man aced a hole in one with his apt assessment
4058473 just when you think they are beaten they bring a fella we dont know off the bench to win the game
4058474 total employment linked to the irish food and drink industry is almost 230 000 and the sector has a gross output of over 18 billion per year
4058475 within this speciality food has shown particular strong growth and become big business in a country where many traditional farm ers have had to diversify in order to stay afloat
4058476 were very excited about kelloggs and 2fm coming to visit our event its going to be a wonderful family day out celebrating sport active lifestyles and community spirit
4058477 all are welcome and we would encourage everyone in the area to come along and join in the fun
4058478 im really looking forward to taking part in what promises to be a wonderful family day out
4058479 were going to have lots of fun broadcasting live to the nation from the event and as someone who sits in a studio five days a week i know only too well the importance of introducing exercise into my day
4058480 were looking forward to taking part in the action and sharing the fun with everyone
4058481 services will not be moved from tralee until all facilities and equipment are available in cork
4058482 most people were saying its hopeless but we had to keep thinking positive as there must have been some chance of at least retaining what we have
4058483 this meeting is a culmination of a number of things that have been happening over the last six months including the 21 000 signatures we collected in the valentines day blitz
4058484 we delivered those signatures to the d il on july 10 and that day mary harney couldnt meet us
4058485 there are so many people around the county who have put in so much work to raise funds for this equipment in their own areas and what will happen to it now where will it be sent
4058486 so many people have worked so hard to fundraise and establish the unit in tralee its unbelievable that all this can be wiped out at the stroke of a pen
4058487 online dating is definitely in the mindset of those aged between 26 and 45 years and in a positive way one third of our survey respondents are already dating online while the others have definite ideas of what they do and dont want from such a service
4058488 there is a wide variety of house designs along the flesk road with many buildings having been converted from single family use to guesthouse accommodation involving large extensions
4058489 we have not received any positive reply from new zealand cricket and heavy rains in punjab province where the three matches were planned did not make the series a possibility
4058490 it is disappointing that sometimes some sub editors focus on a wet day photo graph of killarney to headline a less than positive news story when all around there is a mountain of evidence of killarneys confident and bullish outlook about its future nothing new for killarney i should add
4058491 yes we are experiencing a difficult tourism season and so is the rest of the world but we are not rolling over in the face of these difficulties
4058492 we are out there spreading the positive message even more aggressively than heretofore which is exactly the way we should be responding to such challenges
4058493 they showed a lot of speed in training but we werent too sure that it would transfer to the race but they established a good solid rhythm and finished strong and confident
4058494 we just have to keep going and get out of the repechage for the semi final on thursday
4058495 it attracted a huge crowd and luckily the rain held off so king puck was crowned a dry goat
4058496 when the first day of puck falls on a sunday it always results in a huge crowd and numbers were well up this year
4058497 the festival is a huge boost to the local economy in killorglin and all of the locals look forward to it each year as it brings such a variety of people from all over the globe to the town
4058498 the fact that is happens at all is a miracle and is thanks to a very dedicated organising committee
4058499 i think undoubtedly the memory the tourists bring home is the amazing image of the goat as a king for locals its the camaraderie of puck that is the most important aspect of the festival

4058501 the government wants the island to be acquired by the state we as the property arm are seeking to do that to run it as a heritage site
4058502 the title for the island is not what you would expect if you were buying an office block in dublin
4058503 there is only one opportunity to protect conserve and develop the great blasket island and if we get it wrong the true essence of the island will be lost forever
4058504 the arrival of a single pregnant brown rat on an blascaod m r would have devastating consequences for the manx shearwater colony

4058514 to win the fight against malaria we must attack the disease on many fronts
4058515 exxonmobil is committed to this battle which is why were doing everything we are from helping to develop new drugs facilitating the delivery of insecticide treated bed nets to places where they are desperately needed and supporting programs that prevent the spread of the disease
4058516 exxonmobil has been a corporate leader in the fight against malaria and we are delighted by their support for our work
4058517 this funding will greatly strengthen the pioneering malaria control and elimination efforts under way in southern africa and link them more effectively to similar work in other parts of the world
4058518 malaria knows no borders it cannot be eliminated in any one country unless we tackle it together as a regional strategy
4058519 elimination of this disease requires new levels of regional and international cooperation
4058520 the sabin vaccine which contains type 1 type 2 and type 3 is much less efficacious in tropical countries particularly in india

4058535 redflex is marketing and operating the drs 3 radar in the united states without fcc certification and without any labels or markings showing an fcc id
4058536 these radar units transmit and receive radio waves in a bandwidth that is specifically regulated by the federal communications commission such a radiolocation transmitter device also known as a traffic speed radar system cannot be marketed for sale sold or used in the united states without being type accepted by the fcc

4058540 i went back to your establishment and viewed the seating and service procedures again it was at this time we witnessed most of the seats inside and outside upstairs and downstairs were occupied with full service operation the ramifications of this are extremely severe your flow as we calculated it yesterday was 6 405 gallons per day this is 3 080 gallons per day over your maximum flow allotment furthermore the concept of tavern seats can not be employed at your dining establishment except for the 40 seats in the bomb shelter area based on the operations viewed yesterday this being said you are hereby ordered as owner of the property to cease and desist from all operations at the bookstore restaurant in excess of the approved 3325 gallons per day 95 seats limit by 12 00 pm on august 8 2008
4058541 your failure to comply with this order will now result in enforcement action being taken as well as fines issued in accordance with m g l chapter 40 section 21d i truly hope that you see the seriousness in this matter as we spent a great amount of time guiding you through the appropriate process to avoid any unnecessary violations and to ensure that your establishment was open throughout the summer

4058546 can i have your clients have a word or two with some of clients please
4058547 with competition pressuring from all directions companies that leverage the content of others in order to complement their own content will establish themselves as a consistent go to resource
4058548 at accuquote weve reached out to our customers and asked them to share their interests and they have responded by asking us to find content and companies that match their own interests the widget from personal life media allows us to meet the requests of our customers through an easy to deliver mechanism
4058549 the genres in their podcasts happen to target our particular market base and we see it as a benefit or luxury for our visitors to have the opportunity to listen to an informative podcast on a particular subject
4058550 in most cases we would be very concerned about the content but susan and tim bratton of personal life media have created a classy presentation across the board and we havent come across anything that would be considered less than first class
4058551 at cardscan we define ourselves as a solutions company providing respected third party content on our site is an exciting way that we can provide our customers with information that might help them in their business
4058552 as i called on marketers to sponsor the 25 shows on the personal life media network i heard a similar refrain we like your shows but instead of advertising on them we want the content the actual show on our website the clients site side mentality was a reoccurring theme so we built marketers a free widget that they could trick out to match their site with their logo and feature up to any five podcasts they liked and any marketer can use this with any pocasters for free
4058553 its challenging but clearly weve invested a lot in the club already and intend to do so some more over this next year
4058554 but that was all part of the business plan that we had moving forward so we were crystal clear with our investment group and were very comfortable with it
4058555 i think in this financial climate to reduce debt by 6m in six months is pretty good going and i think its a very positive move
4058556 i think the club is in a good position the debt is very manageable we put in a lot of due diligence when purchasing the club were entirely comfortable with that level of debt it still allows us to invest in the team which weve done significantly since january
4058557 the number of properties that have been foreclosed on by the banks and still havent sold is the highest weve ever seen
4058558 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale
4058559 it is great to be here i thought i would never coach again when i stopped after winning the super 14 with the bulls
4058560 i knew it would have to be a very special job to bring me back into coaching with a club that i think can be among the best in the world
4058561 i know this is a huge challenge but i have been very impressed with everything at leicester tigers so far there are a lot of good structures in place a lot of experienced players and quality coaches and the work ethic has been brilliant
4058562 for me coming here was a sense of getting involved with a club that has the same vision as i have i want to be the best i can be and my aim for the team is the same

4058565 the french economy is not going through merely a soft spot but is really in the process of driving into a recession at least as serious as the one in 1993
4058566 rises in the prices of raw materials weakness of the dollar
4058567 overall these figures raise a real question of economic policy for europeans
4058568 the united states created the crisis and it is europe which has the recession we come back to the same essential question how do we strengthen the potential for growth in the euroland economy
4058569 there is cause for worry gross domestic product is falling back consumption stagnating service activity weakening employment worsening households have the blues and businesses are doubtful
4058570 in this context lets be honest the third quarter is already compromised
4058571 we basically started with the main character and developed the design from there sykes and his explosive approach to problems and obstacles the team did a couple of gameplay and visual prototypes called a meeting to show what warhead could be and everybody was amazed
4058572 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4058573 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4058574 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4058587 die kritik von missethon ist daher an ihn zu richten
4058588 wenn missethon meint mit strache verbal auf bussi bussi machen zu m ssen dann ist das eine sache die er mit sich selber auszumachen hat und seiner wahrscheinlich baldigen ex klientel erkl ren wird m ssen
4058589 wenn er aber meint permanent die sterreichische bundeshauptstadt krank reden zu m ssen dann werden ihm die bewohnerinnen und bewohner der lebenswertesten stadt der eu schon die antwort geben die f hlen sich hier n mlich vornehmlich wohl in welchem viertel auch immer und wissen ganz genau wem sie das zu verdanken haben und wer hier die unruhestifter und neidhammel sind
4058590 die forderung der wiener vp nach einberufung einer neuerlichen sondersitzung des wiener landtages ist nach dem desaster der von ihr verlangten landtagssitzung im juli ber die eu nichts anderes als ein weiterer versuch einer schlechten inszenierung eines wahlkampfspektakels

4058592 es ist richtig dass immer mehr medikamente verschrieben werden und sich die steigerungen in den budgets der krankenkassen widerspiegeln es ist jedoch falsch die l sung dieses problems ber die preisschiene zu suchen
4058593 der staat bekommt f rs nichtstun pro packung mehr an steuern als die apotheker an entgelt f r die leistung damit finanzieren wir aber die arzneimittelsicherheit die medikamentenkontrolle und beratung die ausbildung der mitarbeiter innen und die tag und nacht dienste in ganz sterreich
4058594 die mehrwertsteuer auf medikamente geh rt von 20 auf 10 gesenkt das entlastet die einkommensschwachen haushalte und schafft soziale gerechtigkeit warum kaviar als lebensmittel mit 10 aspirin c als medikament aber mit 20 mehrwertbesteuert wird versteht kein mensch
4058595 wir haben in der j ngeren vergangenheit einige projekte zur kostensenkung bei medikamenten angeregt
4058596 wir sind aber nach wie vor bereit das kostenproblem bei arzneimitteln mit der gesundheitspolitik und den krankenkassen gemeinsam zu l sen dabei sehen wir uns als partner der ober sterreichischen gebietskrankenkasse und streben eine noch engere kooperation im sinne einer optimalen patientenbetreuung an
4058597 es ist nicht einzusehen dass lebensnotwendige medikamente h her besteuert werden als kaviar oder champagner

4058601 a lasting memory of a lovely monet cannot be formed in 20 seconds
4058602 girls in new orleans do it all the time just for beads and that her grade was on the line
4058603 when they first asked me i turned them down im into big vegas shows but dinosaurs not a chance
4058604 they kept after me and when i did finally go to australia on that first trip it was just mind blowing i was hooked i saw the potential right away
4058605 the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe
4058606 i still recall the look on scotts face when he first walked through our door
4058607 i was incredibly excited that anyone would dare to do such a thing but i was nervous that we might not be able to deliver such a concept i was scared and excited at the same time you rely on audiences to do what they do in cinema which is to suspend their disbelief and go along for the ride ultimately the realism and the movement of the models win them over they invest in it completely
4058608 there were various story concepts being talked about when i joined up should it be a memory piece should there be humans onstage i decided we had to go with people alongside the dinosaurs you have to so theres some kind of connection between the audience and the show its also a good reference for the scale of the dinosaurs when you see a person standing next to them you realize how incredibly huge they are
4058609 he made it clear from the start that we had to live up to the expectations the series had set
4058610 the lead operator works what we call a voodoo rig a concept borrowed from film work its basically a glove that you put your hand into and it controls much of the finer movements the third person does the sounds and the jaw movement linking with the sounds and operates the eyes thats important it adds that crucial extra dimension of realism
4058611 we travel with a spare t rex in case of calamity
4058612 we invited 4 000 people to this huge arena in sydney people started rushing in and i said to myself oh my god what if they hate it i got really nervous but as soon as the dinosaurs came onstage people were mesmerized they loved every minute
4058613 they dont complain they take direction well they can be a bit temperamental theyre high tech beasts but in general ive got to say that theyre the biggest actors with the smallest egos ive ever worked with
4058614 the detail is incredible they look absolutely real the only thing they dont do is eat you
4058615 i think it would be a real tragedy if he didnt play here as long as he possibly could
4058616 id love darren to keep playing for the broncos in 2010 2011 and then maybe get on the coaching staff
4058617 im sure hed be a good coach i think he is thinking along those lines and i think that is what he wants to do
4058618 it would be a wonderful thing for him to move into that role especially at this club
4058619 darren is very honest bloke hes very team oriented and he cares a lot about this place
4058620 sam thaiday is off contract greg eastwoods off contract and dave taylor is off contract
4058621 i dont know whats going to happen with those guys and what kind of money will get freed up
4058622 theres still a lot of things to be played out before now and then
4058623 and if you look at the sonny bill thing players can get an offer and come and ask for a release
4058624 that might happen so yes theres a possibility we can keep both of them but well have to wait until april or may next year to find out
4058625 australia is concerned that despite the announcement of a ceasefire agreement which commits both sides to a cessation of all hostilities and the withdrawal of troops to positions held before the conflict broke out there have been reports of ongoing military action by russian forces
4058626 australia calls on russia to honour the terms of the ceasefire respect the territorial integrity of georgia and resolve its differences with georgia through peaceful means
4058627 the military action taken by russia has been disproportionate and has resulted in widespread damage and heavy casualties
4058628 the humanitarian package that we have embraced there is important we believe in terms of the immediate needs of the people affected by the recent military activities between russia and the georgian state
4058629 australians always step in pitch in to help where we can
4058630 this is a long way from australia but this is an appalling war because of the effect on innocent civilians and i support fully the actions of president sarkozy of france in trying to bring about a peaceful resolution to this
4058631 a further 500 000 has been allocated to the international committee of the red cross icrc for the immediate provision of medical supplies to hospitals and the deployment of field hospitals for critical surgery in gori and south ossetia

4058644 the longer the court delays in enforcing the settlement between the parties the more like the value of the consideration subject of the settlement will change
4058645 any further delay in enforcing the settlement will create a serious risk of prejudice to facebook as well as to connectu
4058646 this means the status quo cannot be preserved with a stay
4058647 provides scant consolation given that julys business surveys so far point to a second consecutive fall in the third quarter
4058648 we now expect the eurozone economy to expand at an annual average rate of 1 2 percent this year compared to our previous forecast for a 1 7 percent rise
4058649 i havent really even thought about semi final football we have only thought about playing next week and thats the way weve been all year
4058650 everyone sort of expects us to fail so i think its sort of a little bit of pressure off
4058651 no one really gives us any credit anymore so were just going through doing what we do and hopefully come october were still in the mix
4058652 i suppose thats got to add to your confidence theyre not unbeatable
4058653 both teams have been beaten recently so theres no reason why on our day we cant turn up and beat those teams
4058654 you just go back to the tigers a couple of years ago they definitely werent the best team in the comp probably all year until semi final time they started turning a bit on and really put the sword to a few teams
4058655 theres no reason why we cant be mixing it with these teams and doing a similar thing
4058656 i watched that game last friday night and it was high flying from both teams the confrontations from the manly forwards and the skill of the melbourne backs
4058657 it was a pretty enjoyable game to watch and you compare that to any other game over the weekend i think a lot of teams are off the pace compared to those two teams
4058658 at the start of the week locky walked over and i turned to the boys and said who is this bloke
4058659 they said he was some young kid from roma who was apparently pretty sharp
4058660 i didnt know him and i remember looking at them and saying are you guys serious
4058661 he came on in the 50th minute and i think we were up 40 10 and he did three or four unbelievable things
4058662 i looked at steve renouf and said darren lockyer remember that name because its going to go a long way
4058663 id put him up their with joey and alfie as the best ive ever played with and ive played with some greats
4058664 as a player he is one of the greats but as a mate and what he brings to the game you couldnt ask for anything more
4058665 his comments the other day about owing rugby league so much and that he would never play rugby union typifies the person he is
4058666 great players keep evolving and pound for pound there arent any tougher players
4058667 the kiwis used to try and rough him up all the time before tests but he was that tough it never worked
4058668 just being injured this year hes shown what a marvellous competitor he is to get back and be part of the team
4058669 rugby league needs to hang onto him hes one of a kind
4058670 he is my mate and wayne bennett has been influential in my career
4058671 but at the of the day you want nothing more than to go to suncorp and cause an upset
4058672 if that happens ill be one of the first to walk into the dressing room to congratulate him lockyer on such a great feat so far
4058673 im sure hell be up for a big game back at suncorp for the first time
4058674 its a really big game for us with locky breaking the record
4058675 itll be a great atmosphere and thats the environment he loves
4058676 our back row will be a little smaller without tc carroll and eastwood but david stagg and corey parker will be there and were still going to have some big guys coming off the bench
4058677 well miss a little bit of his impact but well make up for that with staggy and corey going 80 minutes
4058678 hes been one of their form players and you take one of them out of any side and it detracts from your performance
4058679 were glad hes not playing but its not a major issue

4058692 hes one guy weve really spoken about at the end of the day it will probably be a medical decision but the coach is pretty keen for him to play
4058693 i dont want to say there is a magic solution here i am not going to provide false promises i am not going to provide false guarantees about there being some simple solution
4058694 i am trying to turn around a situation which has evolved over many many years and we are dealing with the real consequences of climate change
4058695 theres been some challenge to the accuracy of the murray darling commission numbers
4058696 we will commission one of the independent accounting houses of the world to separately and independently audit the accuracy of the murray darling basin commissions numbers
4058697 i looked back and could see the second carriage on an angle after i stopped i didnt realise the full extent i knew the truck hit me
4058698 i went towards the rear of the train a bloke come towards me he informed me the people in the third carriage were dead
4058699 all of a sudden i saw the truck hit everything just went everywhere
4058700 the front of the truck flew up into the air then i saw the carriage of the train coming past opened up like a tin
4058701 he was trying his hardest to get off the road
4058702 voight is obviously entitled to say and write whatever he wants
4058703 but its only natural that industry based obama supporters will henceforth regard him askance honestly if i were a producer and i had to make a casting decision about hiring voight or some older actor who hadnt pissed me off with an idiotic washington times op ed piece
4058704 while consumers have mastered the art of digital still photography motion pictures and sound still represent a new concept to many
4058705 with just a few changes however novice videographers can create a mini production that everyone will enjoy and with the power of dvd and online video sharing its no longer relegated to viewing just on the family tv family members and friends anywhere can view it with that level of exposure now theres even more pressure to make it interesting

4058709 drive ahead of my actual position because only the brakes worked immediately
4058710 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4058711 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4058712 no he didnt ive improved only in the last year
4058713 i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten
4058714 it really affected my performance because the rain made my gun slippery and i missed several targets
4058715 despite the previously reached agreement russians are deploying additional forces in gori and fortifying the city at the same time russian armed forces have returned to poti
4058716 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
4058717 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4058718 in recent days there have been several instances of pillaging yesterday our police executed two pillagers on the scene
4058719 today we plan to be tougher in addressing this problem
4058720 essa proposta de mudan a traz um retrocesso pois cada hospital poder se adequar de acordo com a sua necessidade por exemplo um hospital de mil leitos poder dizer que precisa s de uma pessoa no controle das infec es n o podemos destruir um sistema e lhe dar novas atribui es para as quais ele n o est preparado
4058721 la sang no arribar al riu tinc la seguretat que els diputats socialistes no votaran en contra del govern de zapatero sigui cual sigui la prov ncia per la qual hagin resultats elegits per als socialistes s n mes importants les persones que els territoris
4058722 tots els diputats socialistes saben i tenim molt recent la lli perqu les eleccions han estat el passat mes de mar que ha pesat m s en el vot ciutad el lideratge de zapatero que el de qualsevol dirigent regional del psoe els ciutadans els electors els dirigents i els diputats socialistes sabem que zapatero pesa electoralment m s que tots els l ders regionals socialistes junts
4058723 tots som necessaris per sense la for a pol tica que zapatero representa potser molts de nosaltres no ser em diputats cal ser aut noms per cal tenir els peus al terra i ser conscients qu sense les sigles del nostre partit i sense zapatero molts no ser em diputats
4058724 hem de compatibilitzar el principi dautonomia dels territoris amb el principi digualtat dels ciutadans per jo no tinc dubtes en cas de conflicte entre lautonomia dun territori i la igualtat dels ciutadans ha de prevaler per a un socialista la igualtat
4058725 in order to provide a more competitive environment for the students and get them used to being with others
4058726 this shows that malays are still far behind other students
4058727 being in tune with pakatan rakyat s attitude of ignoring malay problems
4058728 uitm is one of the special privileges of the malays under article 153 of the federal constitution and that s why the chancellor is the king himself
4058729 the king should advise him dr ibrahim not to make a mountain out of a molehill
4058730 in cases like these it s better to engage with all the parties concerned that is not happening
4058731 especially when the bangsa asing foreigners in this case non malays themselves did not ask to be admitted to the malay university
4058732 the purpose of the memorandum is to demand that he khalid withdraw his statement because it violates the principles on which uitm has been founded as an institute of higher learning to turn out bumiputera professionals
4058733 we want the meddling in uitm to stop this is not healthy although we are all bumiputera we have been educated to respect the religions customs and beliefs of others
4058734 it s not true that we cannot interact with other communities just because uitm has only bumiputera students
4058735 it seems that no one can make any suggestions these days without inviting public demonstrations at the drop of a hat
4058736 no one thinks of engaging in civilised debate anymore obviously these students are being educated beyond their intelligence why the emotional response

4058753 im feeling really frightened now its not safe at all
4058754 after the incident relevant authorities handled it according to law preserved social stability and the normal order of work and life
4058755 im satisfied this was a deliberate attempt by mr mellin to kill himself
4058756 but its not a bad thing to try to investigate if there are ways to do things better
4058757 an obligation to point out corrections in a timely manner

4058762 the hockey community as a whole in pittsburgh is actually on the rise its not an issue of hockey interest its just an issue of the buildings themselves being so extremely costly to operate
4058763 but there were other things in the agreement such as when its sold we have the right to say what the property will be used for
4058764 we also have a right of first refusal to buy back the property
4058765 the current owners are hoping the new owners have the same passion for an ice arena
4058766 they are hoping and optimistic that it will remain as an ice operation
4058767 its going to be a big culture shock coming from a country where medical care is taken for granted she said
4058768 i think the biggest struggle will be seeing how impoverished people are
4058769 shes wanted to go into medicine since she was 5 years old
4058770 a lot of residents have actually complimented him on his diligence in pumping water out of basements people seem to be satisfied
4058771 he couldnt give me a reason other than that he wanted to go in a different direction this year
4058772 why all of a sudden after 16 years are we replacing somebody
4058773 there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is retribution

4058775 this is for students and families who want something different
4058776 i have never been joe citizen and dont plan to be for some time
4058777 i havent been that in 29 1 2 years never when i walk into a restaurant i know exactly who is sitting where what they are wearing who theyre facing how the cars are parked in the parking lot
4058778 its the approach we used in the last several years when vacancies opened up in our fire recreation and public works departments
4058779 so we think in the long run it pays to do an exhaustive search and go through this kind of process
4058780 i may be missed as a friend or a coworker but i am absolutely confident they wont miss a beat and thats the biggest tribute i could ask for
4058781 i took an fbi course in psychology at quantico va and the instructor said that when youre the chief every day you should soar in like an eagle whether youre getting a divorce or your kids wrecked the car or you have cancer or whatever your problems you should walk in and make people glad to be there
4058782 one of the things i am proudest of as chief is that in 10 years of dealing with the school district they have a lot of issues and stresses of which im sure im not aware but we have been able to find areas of mutual concern
4058783 cissy bowman the head of media relations and communications has been a great partner with us we now put out joint press releases in some cases if the school district and the municipality put out the same message first of all it has a calming effect and second it demonstrates that local government is working on all levels
4058784 we share this issue with the school district people dont want to hear about it later they want to be informed now
4058785 the night i got the call that one of my officers had been shot it was like one of my own kids had been shot i can never replicate that feeling the drive from my house to the constants front yard
4058786 rather than call people to my office i just tend to wander around i know thats something that was made famous in corporate america no one likes to be summoned to the chiefs office it makes them nervous
4058787 if i could find a way to stay here until i drop dead of old age id do it
4058788 what makes this store unique is the donations we receive
4058789 the fair policy is to ensure that goods donated at this store remain in this store
4058790 this is going to be the model of all of our stores
4058791 that kept me coming back because it was more fun
4058792 if i dont go in there as much that means im not buying as much
4058793 our goal is keeping the stores well rotated and well stocked
4058794 i said this might be the one time in my life i get to wear a tux
4058795 i took my granddaughter lauren patton up to see that and these 20 something fellows are standing there
4058796 the times are all so much faster now and the rules have changed we didnt have the butterfly in the olympics then either
4058797 we went swimming every day thats when i got the bug
4058798 once we started going especially when we made the big team we were there every day at 7 a m before school and at 4 p m after school
4058799 that was too bad because she was right on my tail all the time we had a friendly rivalry
4058800 i didnt know if it was a rumor or actually true
4058801 i never in the world expected to be there i had just had a good swimming day
4058802 there was quite a crowd in the middle of the night the whole town knew about it
4058803 we were nervous about her we didnt want her to start swimming
4058804 consumption of personal alcohol is prohibited on the festival site
4058805 only alcohol purchased from one of the festivals bars can be drunk on site
4058806 also glass bottles and tin cans are not allowed on the beach for health and safety reasons so all our drinks will be served in recyclable eco friendly containers

4058810 the ceasefire may be weak but at least it has the advantage of existing
4058811 the europe of 27 members states is not well placed to curb russian confidence
4058812 too many countries freed from the yoke of moscow are driven by a desire for revenge against russia to allow for a calm united and consensual european diplomacy poland and the baltic states are not ready
4058813 want to avoid any impression of an anti russian coalition
4058814 shuttle diplomacy between moscow and tbilisi a high risk exercise
4058815 can speak with a strong voice for balance and for peace
4058816 announced the end of hostilities before mr sarkozy had even landed in moscow
4058817 judging from the grave expression on his face it seems that the french president was aware that he had swallowed everything the russians told him
4058818 mr sarkozy isnt claiming to have solved the explosive problem of the caucasus the status of southern ossetia and abkhazia will be resolved later

4058865 todos los diputados socialistas saben que ha pesado m s en el voto ciudadano el liderazgo de zapatero que el de cualquier dirigente regional del psoe
4058866 tengo la seguridad de que los diputados socialistas no van a votar en contra del gobierno sea cual sea la provincia por la que hayan resultado elegidos
4058867 nace de la experiencia que durante muchos a os m s un siglo ha acumulado el psoe
4058868 la importancia que el presidente del gobierno tiene a la hora de conseguir votos para que un socialista obtenga su acta de diputado
4058869 tenemos muy reciente la lecci n porque las elecciones han sido en marzo y los ciudadanos los electores los dirigentes y los diputados sabemos que zapatero pesa electoralmente m s que todos los l deres regionales socialistas juntos
4058870 no es desprecio hacia nadie todos somos necesarios pero sin la fuerza pol tica que zapatero representa quiz muchos de nosotros no ser amos diputados

4058872 australia is concerned that despite the announcement of a ceasefire agreement which commits both sides to a cessation of all hostilities and the withdrawal of troops to positions held before the conflict broke out there have been reports of ongoing military action by russian forces
4058873 australia calls on russia to honour the terms of the ceasefire respect the territorial integrity of georgia and resolve its differences with georgia through peaceful means
4058874 the military action taken by russia has been disproportionate and has resulted in widespread damage and heavy casualties
4058875 the humanitarian package that we have embraced there is important we believe in terms of the immediate needs of the people affected by the recent military activities between russia and the georgian state
4058876 australians always step in pitch in to help where we can
4058877 this is a long way from australia but this is an appalling war because of the effect on innocent civilians and i support fully the actions of president sarkozy of france in trying to bring about a peaceful resolution to this
4058878 a further 500 000 has been allocated to the international committee of the red cross icrc for the immediate provision of medical supplies to hospitals and the deployment of field hospitals for critical surgery in gori and south ossetia

4058886 this report shows us that there are still hurdles that keep all americans from getting the best health care available regardless of which agencies help them get it
4058887 we shouldnt let the distance between ihs and cms get in the way of quality affordable health care for american indians and alaska natives
4058888 our concern was that it creates tremendous confusion for people to get one notice and then another
4058889 im sure they are doing this because the courts dont currently have jurisdiction over the dmhc
4058890 what we have tried to do is to offer enrollees options
4058891 cuts in programs would have to be considerably above 1 billion to meet patersons state savings figure
4058892 we have got to stop this frenzy about spending and lack of accountability
4058893 we need from the legislature real and reoccurring cuts we need a sense of understanding of how serious this problem can get
4058894 theres a lot of evidence that the more patients are required to pay more for their care the more that they make economic decisions about what to get or what not
4058895 while some of that may be perfectly reasonable and acceptable what i worry about is people not getting care that is really essential for their health
4058896 we know from past economic downturns that employers and individuals tighten their budgets as a whole but they certainly tighten their health budgets
4058897 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry
4058898 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4058899 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that
4058900 all of the existing search engines are proprietary black boxes

4058905 noi democratici e in un certo senso anche un gruppo di repubblicani siamo stati pi volte accusati di non voler scovare loro nero ma in realt sono stati i veti e le scappatoie elaborate dai candidati repubblicani a rimandare di giorno in giorno quello che ovviamente rappresenta il problema numero uno della nazione
4058906 la pi esperta intelligente e capace di dare manforte al suo presidente eletto
4058907 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
4058908 the us stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4058909 we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4058910 very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
4058911 any civilized country would act same way i may remind you that on september 11 2001 the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction

4058918 gli elettori delegano il peccato ai potenti cos possono immaginare di non essere colpevoli giudizi di valore da qualche parte per prendere decisioni in base al suo principio e la teoria morale che ha non quindi lutilitarismo ma lo specifico criterio decisionale adottato

4058922 when we talk about tourism and people coming over to visit los angeles theyre not going to see the nasty parts
4058923 the juxtaposition of an oil refinery and a neighborhood was the biggest eye opener for me
4058924 just knowing that their backyard was literally an oil refinery its inspiring and awing at the same time
4058925 if your average tourist or los angeles resident saw what we saw i think theyd have more of an appreciation and also of what organized community action can do

4058961 it seems an elderly man in his 60s has had some kind of fit or seizure
4058962 he has come off the dual carriageway gone through a fence hit a parked car and then went into mcdonalds
4058963 we got the driver out and made the area safe it seems it has caused structural damage to the building
4058964 i heard loads of horns then saw the big 4x4 crash through the fence and hit mcdonalds
4058965 i ran over and switched his engine off because his foot was still flat down on the pedal
4058966 he was alive but he looked out of it and in a really bad way
4058967 we are not getting the business to make it viable
4058968 we started in 1980 and on that weekend you couldnt get in the club because there was so many people
4058969 it started off with the smoking ban which is really biting now
4058970 on top of that theres higher utility bills higher petrol prices and food costs are up people just havent got the money anymore
4058971 the exhibitors are still supporting the shows but we have not been able to recoup the money through beer sales
4058972 its the same where i live weve had two shows close recently
4058973 after miners had been to work and they had no money to spend they used to go on the pots and grow for the table
4058974 but a lot of the older people are dying off and theres not the young ones coming through
4058975 its going to cost me a fortune and i cant afford it
4058976 una combinazione dellalbum di natale del nuovo disco che conterr dei nuovi pezzi heavy metal ed il meglio della produzione targata twisted sister
4058977 an oasis in the desert of point and shoot cameras
4058978 i remember seeing the ball sail over my head as nick davis kicked a goal i wasnt on him at the time but it was gut wrenching
4058979 i was literally eight metres from nick and about two metres from the goal line
4058980 when i look at an object the object is always already gazing at me and from a point at which i can not see it
4058981 im a big music fan joni mitchell fan and jazz fan
4058982 the album just struck me i dont know why it just stuck with me
4058983 jazz composer charles mingus called mitchell and asked her to put lyrics to his music normally his songs didnt have lyrics
4058984 mingus was sick he had lou gehrigs disease and he wanted mitchell to put lyrics to his music
4058985 it was the first painting i did for this show and the one i liked the best
4058986 the paintings came out kind of surreal but it wasnt planned that way
4058987 he outlines his work with enamel then colors it with brilliant watercolors
4058988 the idea that you can take the sound and turn it into a visual will appeal to both types of fans
4058989 this is going to be an awesome show welds work is so colorful and bold it jumps off the wall
4058990 we also have three other shows going on at the same time but this particular show will be spectacular
4058991 she was an outstanding candidate and i know shell be an outstanding coordinator shes enthusiastic and forward thinking im excited shes on board
4058992 i worked for two separate recycling companies friedman recycling in phoenix and e l harvey and sons in massachusetts i sold equipment for four years ive done dispatching and sales i have a lot of experience in customer service
4058993 the first thing is getting familiar with the scale and how things operate
4058994 i have a great team here of four people they kept everything up and running during the interim im happy theyre here i rely on them thats the most important thing having a good team
4058995 thats a good place to start i want to make sure were doing everything possible for the safety of the employees the public that uses the station and the environment id like to visit other transfer stations in the area that have similar characteristics and see what kind of things theyre doing
4058996 the town probably quadruples the amount of waste in the summer
4058997 so its good that i came in at a good time to see it really busy and how much the volume increases in the offseason once things slow down we can look at some of the housekeeping things
4058998 the initial thing is to evaluate the audit and the consultants report
4058999 well look at how we can incorporate some of the things here that have been successful i dont want to make change for the sake of change many things here are working well i want it to be a place where its safe to work and know that were doing the best we can for the town its a work in progress
4059000 once you get farther away from 70 percent you get inequity
4059001 the purpose of a revaluation is not to raise taxes the purpose is to create an equitable distribution of the tax load
4059002 i think a lot of people were satisfied with the appraisal actually well at least a few of them
4059003 the basic thing is dont multiply that number by last years tax rate it will be a different one
4059004 the 50 50 sounds like a good deal but when you do the numbers its not fair for kennebunk
4059005 its like a compromise between four and five and i can live with that
4059006 we are trying to come up with a plan that all the voters can pass
4059007 i just want to make it clear if we dont come up with some type of terms there is going to be a huge penalty
4059008 my kids come into the apartment and they say its damp smelling
4059009 its a little better in the winter when the heats on but its all the time
4059010 i talked with patricia martine the director of the yha several times and she insisted there was no mold
4059011 yes at times they look at me like i dont know what im talking about at times they have not been responsive
4059012 im happy my experience has been nothing but good the office always responds when i call
4059013 she was a phi beta kappa from boston university and a teacher
4059014 she taught for eight years before she got married shes probably the sole reason i got through high school
4059015 this is one of the best if not the best resources we have
4059016 i want to help out but i also want other people to help out as well this is a school thats affordable education opens your eyes to the world
4059017 if the maximum amount of water allowed had been taken we would have had 900 000 a year in additional revenue
4059018 thats a 16 percent increase for the average residential customer that pays about 300 it would be about a 50 saving
4059019 that will affect more users with less of an impact
4059020 were taxing people who actually use more water not just because they have large meters
4059021 we looked at the number of customers affected in selecting a use level
4059022 we chose it based on what an average user would have used this will affect seasonals more we have to build our structure to handle the peak flow
4059023 the trustees felt that was a fairer way to bill
4059024 it is very concerning to the sheriffs and all those responsible to public safety
4059025 the reason for concern is the accuracy and lack of information passed on about this crash not only to emergency responders but also to the public
4059026 this achievement comes as a result of oman airs dedicated efforts to continuously enhance its standards of quality and safety in all fields of civil aviation
4059027 when adequate parking facilities for the accommodation of traffic have been provided and paid for the rates fees and charges shall be adjusted to provide funds for maintenance and operation only
4059028 when i first eyeballed it the obvious reason for it was that there was a need for towns to spend money on parking lots they floated bonds on them there was only one court case and essentially it said that once youve paid them off you can continue to use the money for maintenance and repair and thats it
4059029 i dont know where this law actually plays into us
4059030 i dont have just one account it cuts across every department budget in some way visitor services the department that staffs the lots is one small piece of the big picture we spent two hours here this morning counting the receipts from the weekend for example its all about the parking lots in the summer
4059031 we have a lot more people coming to our beach and parking than they have which accounts for the increased income
4059032 expenses associated with one year arent necessarily the same as the next
4059033 for example we dont pave the lots every year and the costs cant be limited to just the beach area
4059034 one killer gear deal one item at a time until its gone
4059035 vezi sa nu scrii dreq cine stie ce jeguri ridicole sa te rada lumea
4059036 da tu ce cauti pe aci aaaaa vrei si tu sa studiezi afara hi hi ce dragutz
4059037 fii dreq barbat ba muie doar bunica tu cand era de varsta ta facea foamea si frigu la cotu donului si nu se caca pe el atata
4059038 its designed to reflect the true cost of providing service to different classes of customers and also to encourage conservation
4059039 in general the cost of service study we performed was the first one weve ever done this one uses modern accounting principles
4059040 residential customers as a class and seasonal customers in particular are causing our seasonal usage peaks
4059041 but residentials that use very little water 50 gallons per day is our new minimum 100 used to be will see a 24 percent decrease a single family home using 500 gallons or more per day will see an increase of five percent or more
4059042 i encourage people to seek alternative water sources for irrigation during peak season
4059043 large commercials will pay more many small commercials will see a significant decrease
4059044 the seasonal accounts have more operating costs because they exacerbate peak demand
4059045 they are also more costly administratively because we have to close them out and then reopen them each year
4059046 only 10 percent of our users will see an increase over 2 percent
4059047 ninety percent were using 250 gallons or less per day the highest increase is about 28 percent for customers that use 1 500 gallons per day
4059048 seeing the ducks cross the bridge is a riot to watch
4059049 once in a while you get a straggler that goes off to the side and you need a kayaker to fish them out
4059050 we came in as the strong team and everyone knew it
4059051 i think it was the best 100 meter run ever in relay
4059052 weve had a great variety of people participate in the olympics over the years
4059053 jerry ashworth was a fantastic runner but was not alone by any stretch
4059054 it just so happened that someone knew about it about 10 years ago and it finally came up in a conversation
4059055 after the second round of interviews i would hope to be able to make a job offer and negotiate the terms of employment
4059056 i dont do a lot for myself id rather be helping others
4059057 you go over to some of the places in africa that we work with and you have people there that are pretty much living in a home made of cardboard or living on a dollar or two a day
4059058 by world standards americans are wealthy and so you go over there and one of the things they have to get used to is that they are almost like superheroes or a walking wallet
4059059 i still kind a think i might be going to college in the fall a lot of my friends are though
4059060 it cannot however be confident that these efforts will generate funds sufficiently quickly for it to meet all of its obligations as they fall due over the coming weeks and months
4059061 dem internet kommt bei der partnersuche eine stark zunehmende bedeutung zu
4059062 eine partnersuche ohne einsatz des internets wird bald so aussichtslos sein wie das zuf llige suchen einer bestimmten adresse ohne den entsprechenden stadtplan
4059063 noch vor wenigen jahren war die partnersuche im internet gesellschaftlich noch nicht sehr angesehen
4059064 die suche nach einer neuen liebe im netz wird heute als ganz normale legitime methode angesehen jeder sechste internetnutzer findet inzwischen einen partner im web
4059065 die tendenz ist klar steigend vor einem jahr hatten wir noch 750 000 mitglieder
4059066 vor allem f r ltere menschen die nicht mehr so oft ausgehen wie j ngere wird die online partnersuche zunehmend als alternative eingesetzt

4059070 the first funkyou site was a project started by okapi studio around 2004 and like many of those reading this right now we were watching and posting on that site everybody thought it was a cool project but then towards the end of 2005 it all stopped and sometime after that the domain registration for funkyou ro expired

4059073 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4059074 the russian troops drew their weapons the georgians responded in kind
4059075 what is clear is that the complete russian victory in this small but nasty war has created a new reality on the ground
4059076 not just in georgia but in relations between russia and the west
4059077 we hope we will soon conclude discussions on the deal between the two governments
4059078 if we manage to conclude this matter we will be in a situation that will allow a complete normalisation of relations with libya
4059079 nichts hat gefehlt es waren 400 euro die bankomat karte die e card und meine ausweise drinnen
4059080 in fact two thirds to three fourths of the pbx lines that toshiba ships are still of the tdm variety when customers buy ip lines and phones its for a particular purpose it seems the majority of their users are local and they choose digital phones for those users and opt for ip for remote sites and wireless applications and for the other devices such as cameras that are on the system ip doesnt provide you with any telephony features all it does is provide you with some connectivity options
4059081 businesses can keep their old phones for a long time even those that they bought with the key systems that long predated the ip pbx era you can take digital phones we made 10 years ago and hook them up with the cix ip systems we sell today
4059082 well im not voting for his abortion policy thats just one issue and hes so good on other things like healthcare for everybody income redistribution an end to the unjust transgression in iraq affirmative action unto perpetuity and his desire to refurbish our image in the world especially in the european union and maybe the terrorists wont hate us so much when they see what a nice citizen of the world sort of fellow he is i mean im against abortion but theres nothing anyone can do about it
4059083 another prolifer vote god bless him as a reward im going to
4059084 can commit to each other like that and then just walk away

4059087 i always said that if we did not fight them in saigon we would have to fight them in san francisco but with the olympics going on atlanta is an obvious symbolic target
4059088 im not supporting a timetable but i think the national guard troops from georgia should come home from iraq immediately and blunt this unwarranted invasion i have been saying for years that we need to beef up security on the georgia indiana border
4059089 nations do not invade states in fact even in the 20th century nations did not invade states although killer bees did invade california
4059090 except for a few complaints about the heat they are shopping as if nothing had happened fulfilling my and president bushs strategy after 9 11 just to show my solidarity i am buying 2 more pair of 520 shoes and charging it to cindy obama may have pitched in to help the flooding in wisconsin but when the chips are down im here in atlanta to help the people of georgia

4059095 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4059096 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4059097 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4059098 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4059099 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4059100 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4059101 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4059102 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4059103 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4059104 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4059105 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4059106 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4059107 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4059108 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4059109 supporters and foes of the bloomberg administrations plan to turn gritty willets point in queens into a 3 billion development of stores offices and apartments faced off wednesday in a confrontation that grew emotional and raucous at times the city council must decide this fall whether to approve the rezoning plan which would require the removal of more than 200 small businesses including auto body shops and industrial outlets
4059110 and i might point out that theres almost nobody that signed that letter almost nobody from queens they were from other places where perhaps they are getting support from real estate interests who just want to be able to be in a position to hold up the city
4059111 the mayor said that of the council members who signed the letter
4059112 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity

4059146 the breakdown is not a change only a breakthrough would have been one
4059147 the final straw for the talks yesterday was the us ignoring pleas from developing countries to be able to properly protect themselves and their vulnerable producers against sudden import surges at a time of volatile prices and fluctuating import export trends such safeguards are absolutely essential to protect the livelihoods of rural producers in poor countries yet the us would not accept that

4059151 la controversia suscitada por algunos medios de comunicaci n en torno al gesto que realizan los jugadores de la selecci n espa ola masculina
4059152 una campa a publicitaria previa a los juegos ol mpicos de beijing
4059153 tal y como afortunadamente ha entendido la inmensa mayor a del p blico espa ol e internacional y ha corroborado la embajada de la rep blica popular china en espa a el nico significado de dicho gesto es de cari o simpat a y reconocimiento que es lo que siente esta federaci n por el pueblo chino y su pa s
4059154 la feb mantiene una ya larga relaci n con el baloncesto de la rep blica popular china con cuyo desarrollo est comprometida lo que se refleja tanto en la estrecha colaboraci n en la formaci n de rbitros jugadores y entrenadores como en la regular visita
4059155 de los diferentes equipos de la federaci n de baloncesto de la rep blica popular china para competir y preparar sus competiciones internacionales invitados por la feb
4059156 adem s de las relaciones deportivas la feb ha sido una de las primeras federaciones del mundo en mantener tambi n relaciones comerciales con instituciones y empresas chinas como la firma de ropa deportiva li ning cuyo contrato suscrito con la feb es el m s antiguo de sus acuerdos

4059159 una vez hecho p blico este comunicado con el que da por cerrada la cuesti n la feb no realizar ninguna otra declaraci n al respecto

4059189 las medidas que ser n anunciadas hoy se han concebido para estimular la econom a a medida que el pa s se sume en la crisis m s profunda por la que nunca ha pasado este par ntesis en las vacaciones de zapatero ha sido visto como un intento por acallar las cr ticas de la oposici n que opina que el gobierno no est haciendo lo suficiente por solucionar la desaceleraci n econ mica este a o en un esfuerzo por protegerse de la recesi n del a o que viene zapatero ha anunciado 10 000 millones de euros en reducciones fiscales pero la apagada econom a espa ola no muestra signos de mejor a

4059194 no se excluye que zapatero despu s del verano adem s de realizar nuevas medidas econ micas tambi n introduzca cambios de gabinete sobre todo en los ministerios de econom a y trabajo es dif cil predecir cu les medidas podr a adoptar el gobierno a partir del jueves pero es probable que tiendan a incentivar los consumos y la competitividad de las empresas adem s de brindar apoyo al sector inmobiliario tambi n se puede prever un impulso al sector de las obras p blicas y una ayuda a las familias espa a est dispuesta a endeudarse pero sin renunciar al rigor fiscal para no superar los par metros de maastricht
4059195 zapatero interrumpe las vacaciones para evaluar la situaci n econ mica
4059196 el presidente espa ol jos lu s rodr guez zapatero interrumpi las vacaciones para presidir extraordinariamente los trabajos de la comisi n delegada de asuntos econ micos que ayer transcurrieron en madrid el encuentro que antecedi a una reuni n del consejo de ministros extraordinaria que se realizar hoy sirvi para analizar la dif cil situaci n econ mica del pa s haciendo balance del paquete de medidas de emergencia ya implementadas y preparar un conjunto de soluciones para reducir la burocracia en las relaciones entre las empresas y el estado
4059197 seria deseable que hoy salvando las distancias tuvi semos dirigiendo la naci n un gobierno capaz y a la altura de las circunstancias pero no lo tenemos si lo tuvi semos el presidente del gobierno espa ol rodr guez zapatero no celebrar a con pompa los 100 d as del segundo mandato en una altura en que se vuelve a hablar del d ficit de las cuentas p blicas en que la inversi n se par y en que el desempleo empieza a llegar practicante a todas las familias
4059198 el debilitamiento de la producci n industrial empa a las previsiones para la eurozona
4059199 en espa a donde la actividad empresarial y los precios de las viviendas han ca do a pesar de los esfuerzos del gobierno para estimular la econom a la producci n industrial descendi un 9 con relaci n al mismo mes del a o pasado en espa a la inflaci n del mes de julio se elev a un 5 3 un portavoz declar el mi rcoles que el presidente espa ol jos luis rodr guez zapatero interrumpir sus vacaciones estivales para presidir el jueves una consejo de ministros extraordinario que se centrar en el establecimiento de m s medidas que contrarresten una econom a deteriorada aceleradamente

4059201 se busca un nuevo modelo de crecimiento para espa a
4059202 en menos de un a o espa a ha pasado de un din mico crecimiento a una grave situaci n de malestar a medida que la explosi n de la burbuja inmobiliaria los altos precios energ ticos y la crisis financiera mundial han consumido a una velocidad aterradora su principal sustento un pico auge inmobiliario basado en el constante aumento del valor de la propiedad quiz s haya llegado el momento de que espa a busque un futuro distinto pero ahora con su buque insignia hecho trizas los espa oles estudian la sostenibilidad de su otrora pr spero modelo econ mico
4059203 el mi rcoles el presidente espa ol jos luis rodr guez zapatero convoc una reuni n de emergencia para estudiar las respuestas pol ticas a una coyuntura econ mica que no hace sino dar malas noticias los datos publicados ese mismo d a revelaban un aumento de la inflaci n del 5 3 en el mes de julio con respecto al a o anterior el nivel m s alto de los ltimos 15 a os lo que demuestra que los precios siguen aumentando a pesar de que el pa s entre en recesi n zapatero recurri con retraso a la palabra crisis para describir la situaci n del pa s poniendo el dedo en la llaga de los espa oles que no han sufrido una recesi n econ mica significativa desde la gran crisis posterior a las olimpiadas de barcelona de 1992
4059204 la inflaci n interanual espa ola alcanza el 5 3
4059205 el secretario de estado de econom a david vegara afirma que la tasa interanual de julio es la m s alta desde diciembre de 1992 la econom a espa ola se est enfriando a pasos agigantados debido al hundimiento del sector inmobiliario este a o se espera que el crecimiento econ mico sea solo del 1 6 y del 1 en 2009 en comparaci n con el 3 8 de 2007 el gobierno celebrar hoy jueves una reuni n extraordinaria con motivo de la crisis
4059206 si est convencido de que un deposito bancario es una aplicaci n sin riesgo es el momento de revisar esa convicci n a nivel global las instituciones financieras est n hoy en una situaci n m s fr gil de lo que estaban hace un a o y si no hay motivos para entrar en p nico la crisis actual puede servir para deshacer mitos que hasta los propios banqueros acostumbran alimentar
4059207 cuando se analizan las cuentas de las grandes instituciones financieras espa olas surgen motivos para envidiar a la gallina del vecino los indicadores revelan que las respectivas balanzas son s lidas y que cuando se les pregunta sobre los impactos de la actual crisis en las organizaciones que lideran los banqueros espa oles tendr an que responder con otra pregunta crisis qu crisis y de todas formas puede que no sea as la crisis del cr dito es vasta profunda y global avis ayer merril lynch todo estar a dentro de las expectativas si el banco de inversi n norteamericano no hubiese a adido la que verdaderamente supone una mala noticia la crisis est lejos del fin y no conviene subestimarla en otras palabras lo que ahora parece terreno firme puede no serlo en espa a el cr dito de cobro dudoso est creciendo m s r pidamente que en portugal es demasiado pronto para envidiar a la gallina espa ola
4059208 la banca espa ola todav a est mejor que la portuguesa
4059209 a pesar de ser apuntada como la potencial pr xima victima de la crisis financiera la banca espa ola todav a presenta mejor salud financiera que la cong nere portuguesa el mal estado y el freno econ mico son las principales amenazas a los grupos financieros del otro lado de la frontera pero en el sistema financiero espa ol hay bancos que tienen mejores condiciones para resistir la crisis las operaciones internacionales del santander y del bbva ayudar n a estas instituciones
4059210 el gobierno de zapatero ve en el descenso del n mero de inmigrantes los efectos de su pol tica activa de repatriaci n de los sin papeles y de la eficacia cada vez mayor de los radares instalados a lo largo del litoral andaluz y canario que forman una frontera electr nica bautizada como sive pero el principal motivo reconocen los socialistas en el poder se debe a la brusca crisis econ mica que vive espa a
4059211 el sector de la construcci n que hasta ahora era el pilar del crecimiento y reclutaba la mano de obra inmigrante se ha hundido m s de la mitad de los nuevos parados son extranjeros parece que los candidatos a la emigraci n hubieran hecho correr la voz espa a ya no es el dorado
4059212 el verano favorece la llegada mar tima de clandestinos al sur de europa
4059213 el golpe de estado en mauritania ha acelerado en el mes de agosto el desembarco de inmigrantes en las islas canarias las llegadas de multiplican en sicilia malta y grecia
4059214 una nueva embarcaci n con 61 inmigrantes africanos fue interceptada el lunes 11 de agosto en los cristianos al sur de la isla de tenerife este suceso eleva a 333 el n mero de clandestinos africanos que han desembarcado durante los ltimos cuatro d as en canarias esta nueva oleada de llegadas que sucede a un relativo per odo de calma comenz dos d as despu s del golpe militar de mauritania seg n confirm un responsable espa ol subrayando que las embarcaciones esperaban la llegada del barco espa ol que patrulla en la zona para socorrerlos
4059215 la invasi n rusa de georgia es un golpe contra el n cleo de los valores occidentales en nuestro sistema de seguridad del siglo xxi si la comunidad internacional permite a rusia aplastar nuestro estado democr tico e independiente dar carta blanca a gobiernos autoritarios de todo el mundo rusia no s lo trata de destruir un pa s sino tambi n una idea durante demasiado tiempo hemos estado infravalorando la crueldad del r gimen de mosc ayer dio m s pruebas de su duplicidad a las 24 horas de acordar un alto el fuego las fuerzas rusas entraban en gori bloqueaban el puerto de poti hund an nav os georgianos y lo peor de todo purgaban con brutalidad poblaciones georgianas en osetia del sur violando mujeres y ejecutando hombres no se puede confiar en la direcci n rusa y esa dura realidad ha de ser la gu a de la respuesta occidental s lo las fuerzas occidentales de paz pueden poner fin a la guerra
4059216 algunos estadounidenses se preguntan si los sucesos en esa parte del mundo son motivo de preocupaci n para nosotros despu s de todo georgia es un lugar remoto peque o y oscuro sin embargo a menudo la historia se hace en lugares remotos y oscuros aunque el gobierno ruso dice que s lo est actuando para proteger a los osetios el verdadero objetivo ruso parece ser el cambio de r gimen a pesar del alto el fuego conseguido gracias a la mediaci n francesa que preocupantemente no hace referencias a la integridad territorial georgiana prosiguen los ataques rusos
4059217 el pueblo georgiano ha sufrido con anterioridad y sufrir ahora debemos ayudarle en esta tragedia y debe saber que los pensamientos oraciones y apoyo norteamericanos est n con l esta peque a democracia alejada de nuestras costas sirve de inspiraci n para los que comparten nuestros m s alabados ideales como le dije al presidente saakashvili el d a que se declar el alto el fuego hoy somos todos georgianos no debemos olvidarlo
4059218 el mi rcoles por la ma ana el presidente dmitri medvedev prometi a los negociadores europeos que rusia detendr a los ataques a georgia y que empezar a la retirada de sus tropas unas horas m s tarde los tanques rusos se adentraban en la encrucijada estrat gica de la ciudad de gori a s lo 40 millas de la capital de georgia tbilisi no estamos seguros de si esto significa que medvedev no es quien est al mando o que estaba mintiendo para ganar tiempo para derrocar el gobierno democr ticamente electo de georgia ambas explicaciones producen escalofr os
4059219 estados unidos y sus aliados deben advertir a mosc que su deseo de unirse a la omc no llegar a ninguna parte mientras siga brutalizando a su vecino la uni n europea debe decir a rusia que no emprender acuerdos de cooperaci n econ mica y pol tica hasta que mosc no est dispuesto a comportarse como un socio responsable
4059220 rusia acord el martes detener la acci n militar en georgia el presidente ruso dimitry medvedev y el primer ministro vladimir putin s lo est n ganando tiempo ya que aceptan detener las acciones militares pero exigen la retirada de las tropas georgianas de osetia del sur y de abjasia tambi n est n pidiendo un cambio de r gimen el kremlin busca socavar a georgia y ganar gradualmente el control sobre los pa ses que formaban parte de la ex uni n sovi tica los rusos est n en el camino hacia el imperialismo y deben ser detenidos
4059221 occidente tiene la oportunidad de enviar una se al tanto a rusia como a toda la regi n de que la era sovi tica ha terminado el presidente franc s nicolas sarkozy que tambi n lidera la ue ha insistido en que rusia y georgia se retiren a las posiciones que ten a antes del conflicto la ue deber a ser a n m s firme las tropas rusas han demostrado que no pueden funcionar como fuerzas de mantenimiento de la paz en la regi n estas tropas deben ser sustituidas por las fuerzas de las naciones unidas para garantizar la seguridad de los ciudadanos de osetia del sur y de abjasia y evitar futuras conflagraciones occidente debe insistir en que no habr cambio de r gimen en georgia y en que los esfuerzos para integrar a georgia en la otan no han llegado a su fin este es un momento definitivo para la regi n
4059222 los jefes de exteriores de los pa ses de la ue aprobaron ayer en bruselas en una reuni n de urgencia un plan de regulaci n para la situaci n en osetia del sur este plan fue acordado la v spera por los presidentes de rusia y francia dmitri medvedev y nicol s sarkozy el ministro de exteriores franc s bernard kouchner declar que la ue est dispuesta a enviar a georgia a inspectores europeos george bush ha expresado la posici n oficial de los ee uu rusia debe mantener su palabra y poner fin a esta crisis declar el dirigente estadounidense al tiempo que expres la esperanza de que rusia permita desplegar en georgia toda la ayuda humanitaria posible seg n bush con sus acciones rusia pone en una situaci n arriesgada su participaci n en las instituciones internacionales
4059223 el presidente de ee uu george bush amenaz ayer a rusia con el aislamiento internacional y anunci el inicio de su injerencia en el conflicto georgiano osetio se trata del env o a georgia de ayuda humanitaria el presidente georgiano mijail saakashvili minutos despu s de las declaraciones de george bush explic que los aviones y barcos estadounidenses asumir n la vigilancia de los puertos y aeropuertos georgianos los medios de comunicaci n estadounidenses informan al un sono de que la causa fundamental de la guerra es el intento de mosc de no permitir la exportaci n de hidrocarburos del caspio hacia occidente evitando pasar por el territorio rusia
4059224 el plan de regulaci n del conflicto georgiano oseta propuesto por el presidente dmitri medvedev fue convenido ayer en bruselas por los ministros de asuntos exteriores de la ue en l la parte georgiana ha precisado s lo un punto pero clave el referente al estatus de osetia del sur y abjasia los expertos consideran que rusia se ha visto obligada a hacer esta concesi n dado que en caso contrario se ver a inmersa en el aislamiento pol tico el problema se ahonda a n m s con el hecho de que rusia casi ha perdido la guerra informativa
4059225 rusia ha perdido la guerra informativa de las pantallas de los canales de televisi n occidentales s lo han salido noticias de la agresi n rusa contra la soberana georgia y los torrentes de desinformaci n se completaban con informes sobre el ataque de los tanques rusos sobre tbilisi durante las primeras quince horas cuando tbilisi bombardeaba tsijinvali y eliminaba a su poblaci n civil las agencias de informaci n mundiales simplemente callaron
4059226 rusia afirma que utiliz su derecho de leg tima defensa contra georgia
4059227 en una carta presentada por mosc como documento oficial ante el consejo de seguridad de la onu consta que rusia ejerci su derecho a una leg tima defensa a ra z de la agresi n georgiana contra osetia del sur el lanzamiento de una operaci n militar georgiana en osetia del sur subraya el documento fue una violaci n de los acuerdos existentes sobre el cese del fuego en la zona del conflicto georgiano oseta provoc notables destrucciones en la capital suroseta tsjinvali y caus 1 500 v ctimas civiles la mayor a de las cuales ten an nacionalidad rusa el contingente ruso de paz que forma parte de las fuerzas mixtas para el mantenimiento de la paz y permanece en el territorio georgiano con car cter legal tambi n sufri bajas a ra z de ese ataque masivo y deliberado las tropas rusas subraya la carta recibieron la orden de no realizar ataques contra la poblaci n y las instalaciones civiles
4059228 el presidente georgiano ha hecho muy a su pesar un gran favor a rusia
4059229 la guerra ruso georgiana que marcar el verano de 2008 es un conflicto tradicional entre dos estados en torno a un desaf o aparentemente claro la suerte de osetia del sur pero se deriva sobre todo de la voluntad despiadada de ambas partes de cuestionar los equilibrios geopol ticos existentes desde hace casi veinte a os esta guerra confirma en definitiva el regreso de rusia al panorama internacional una rusia segura de s misma que manifiesta sin complejos sus intereses nacionales tambi n supone la aceptaci n por parte de la comunidad de naciones de tratar con esta rusia y no con un estado disminuido saakachvili en su loco proyecto de desafiar a rusia le ha hecho probablemente el mayor favor de los ltimos a os
4059230 fin de la secuencia europea inicio de la secuencia americana las palabras de george w bush han marcado un cambio muy claro en la evoluci n del conflicto georgiano un cambio de los m s cl sicos tras la brutal intervenci n rusa y la mediaci n europea entramos en la fase l gica del enfrentamiento entre las dos grandes potencias tradicionales bush ense a sus m sculos enviando aviones y barcos militares para dar ayuda humanitaria a georgia tambi n env a a tbilisi a condoleeza rice
4059231 en cuanto a los europeos divididos entre los antiguos y nuevos miembros de la uni n los primeros comprensivos con rusia los segundos para nada esperan que el acuerdo sarkozy medvedev aguante alg n tiempo los rusos quieren afirmar su tutela sobre su extranjero cercano
4059232 la c pula rusa no tiene mucho que temer si sus tropas contin an operando en georgia e ignoran el plan de paz que al fin y al cabo ha sido aceptado por medvedev al menos no tiene que temer nada de la ue que ya est toda orgullosa de querer enviar a observadores que adem s no son de la otan puede que realmente haya llegado el momento de reflexionar sobre el papel de rusia en el g 8 y no se puede negociar un acuerdo de asociaci n como si no hubiera ocurrido nada
4059233 los europeos hacen como si pudieran relajar la situaci n con tropas de paz de la ue pero rusia no ha dado su aprobaci n y ning n pa s europeo enviar voluntariamente soldados a una zona en conflicto sin la aprobaci n de todos los involucrados por tanto de momento se trata de un debate fantasma con el que la ue trata de ocultar su verdadero problema europa est profundamente dividida en cuanto a la respuesta que debe dar a la manifestaci n de poder rusa ahora que la ue ha asumido el papel de mediador rusia puede prepararse para un escenario c modo am rica est lejos y en plena campa a electoral europa capitula ante el poder y ante si misma
4059234 la uni n europea acaba de obtener por mediaci n del presidente sarkozy un hermoso pero fr gil xito diplom tico al conseguir que los beligerantes rusos y georgianos aprueben un plan de paz conviene felicitarse sin caer en triunfalismos de que los europeos a menudo ausentes y o divididos y o impotentes en la escena internacional hayan asumido sus responsabilidades la ue dispone de las mejores bazas para actuar como interlocutor privilegiado de mosc y tbilisi ya que ee uu tiene demasiados nexos con los georgianos y el consejo de seguridad de la onu no puede hacer caso omiso del parecer de los rusos
4059235 no obstante el ejercicio se anuncia delicado sobre todo porque tras vencer las reticencias polacas y lituanas la ue se dispone a negociar un nuevo acuerdo de asociaci n con rusia que resulta de vital importancia teniendo en cuenta las necesidades energ ticas de la ue
4059236 el conflicto en el c ucaso toca a su fin puede que tan s lo sea una paz temporal pero no cabe duda de que la violencia militar ha decrecido en beneficio de la diplomacia los mediadores hacen cola y la ue quiere demostrar de lo es capaz tras fracasar en los balcanes la uni n desea tener m s xito en el c ucaso ya que es consciente de que el tema es europeo ciertamente georgia no es miembro de la ue ni de la otan y rusia sigue siendo rusia pero el polvor n cauc sico est en nuestro patio trasero tbilisi y mosc han de llegar a una soluci n aceptable con la ayuda y mediaci n de europa
4059237 el l der georgiano saakachvili cay en la trampa de mosc en pocos d as putin controla la regi n disputada y amenaza con reducir a georgia a una entidad virtual la guerra de georgia primera acci n b lica de la ex uni n sovi tica no s lo tiene un fuerte impacto regional sino que da una portentosa lecci n a los estados unidos contribuyendo a redefinir los equilibrios globales la balbuciente respuesta norteamericana al conflicto ruso georgiano es la consecuencia de una pol tica titubeante entre ganarse la amistad de putin y el intento de logar una nato dilatada capaz de anular la influencia rusa en europa este peligro que al inicio asust a los rusos ha ocasionado predecibles reacciones
4059238 que estados unidos amenace con excluir a rusia del g8 y env e ayudas humanitarias en naves militares a georgia puede contribuir a la campa a electoral republicana pero no asustar a putin convencido del apoyo de sus aliados de la vieja europa
4059239 la uni n europea ue se mostr ayer abierta al env o de observadores para controlar el alto el fuego en georgia y en las regiones separatistas de abjasia y de osetia del sur pero est dividida en cuanto a la reacci n a la crisis en el c ucaso por un lado el reino unido y los pa ses del antiguo bloque sovi tico est n a favor de una respuesta m s dura a rusia mientras que alemania francia e italia mantienen una posici n m s cautelosa antes de la reuni n de emergencia de los ministros de exteriores de la ue ayer en bruselas el ministro de exteriores david milliband dijo que europa tiene que decidir si quiere o no y c mo continuar profundizando sus lazos con mosc aproxim ndose a la posici n de washington
4059240 por primera vez desde la creaci n del euro en 1999 el crecimiento del pib de la zona podr a ser negativo en el segundo trimestre es decir europa estar a al borde de la recesi n el pib de la zona euro que se har p blico esta ma ana habr a disminuido un 0 8 en el segundo trimestre seg n el consenso de 41 economistas interrogados por la agencia bloomberg estos economistas piensan que el crecimiento ha sido negativo en alemania francia espa a italia austria e irlanda el banco central europeo no deber a arriesgarse a subir este a o los tipos de inter s una perspectiva que hace que suba el d lar y baje el precio del petr leo
4059241 el di logo emprendido ayer por el presidente evo morales y los prefectos de beni pando tarija oruro potos y chuquisaca no prosper aunque se espera que hoy ambas partes puedan concretar avances y alcanzar resultados en beneficio de la poblaci n sobre el encuentro el viceministro de descentralizaci n fabi n yaksic inform que el encuentro se desarroll en un ambiente tranquilo buscando concertar dos agendas una nacional y otra regional que demanda el proceso auton mico mencion que el jefe de estado plante trabajar en tres pactos uno constitucional auton mico que relacione los estatutos constitucionales y el proceso de autonom as un pacto fiscal que trate el tema econ mico y los recursos del impuesto directo a los hidrocarburos y un pacto institucional para agilizar las designaciones
4059242 las inconsistencias en las que han incurrido tanto john mccain y barack obama al fijar sus posturas sobre los temas de inter s p blico y la insistencia de los medios y de otros actores pol ticos en destacarlas ha sido una constante en la actual campa a presidencial estadounidense poco se ha escrito sin embargo sobre las caracter sticas del sistema electoral estadounidense y de hecho de cualquier sistema democr tico que no s lo alientan la inconsistencia de los pol ticos sino que la propician
4059243 exigirle uniformidad a un pa s que se define por la diversidad de raza etnias religiones ideolog as sentimientos y pensamientos o condenar el sistema pol tico estadounidense porque entre sus varias imperfecciones alienta y propicia la inconsistencia de los pol ticos ser a un desprop sito la principal virtud de los sistemas democr ticos es precisamente su capacidad para tolerar la discusi n y el desacuerdo para luego resolverlo en el compromiso

4059269 i dont know exactly whats going to happen but i am generally optimistic because i see that ordinary people actually do love to engage with the issues and actually talk about things in detail

4059280 senator barack obama retains an eight point lead over senator john mccain among registered voters in the latest harris poll virtually unchanged since the nine point lead he enjoyed in early july
4059281 demographic analysis of these voting intentions shows that this is not a typical election
4059282 age obamas lead is critically dependent on his 33 point lead among echo boomers people under 32 but they are usually are the least likely generation to actually vote
4059283 gender there is currently no gender gap in this election obamas lead is almost the same among men 8 points and women 10 points

4059288 from a nationalist insurgency to a force in the global jihad
4059289 so did america leave us any choice with this flagrant aggression
4059290 no doubt that the answer is going to be no therefore it became our right and our duty to push away with all our strength this crusade campaign and declare clearly that the american interests are legitimate targets to us
4059291 there isnt a big concern because the important american interests in the south are heavily secured and very difficult to access
4059292 likewise the u s diplomatic corps is in a bunker as they are in all arab countries thirdly there simply arent very many american tourists here so in my opinion the chances of the gspc successfully attacking american interests in algeria are practically zero
4059293 the gspc in 2001 it had about 5 000 to 6 000 members but several years later it had only about 1 000 fighters
4059294 the authorities managed to have negotiations with two of the three clans that left droukdal and his clan on their own but then he benefited from the invasion of iraq which was for him a miracle a golden opportunity

4059298 the explosion of illegal emigration to its current level came about in the wake of the failure of the islamists in the maqi
4059299 and this is very important there was a huge transfer of energy among young people in the last 10 years their aspirations their ambitions all shifted to escaping the country
4059300 they made stupid mistakes when they target the u n they target the press innocent civilians
4059301 theyre making a lot of mistakes and stupid mistakes of course it plays into the hands of the big nations
4059302 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4059303 the russian troops drew their weapons the georgians responded in kind

4059435 and almost everyone i run into tells me the worst rash i ever got was to poison ivy
4059436 there were a number of animal studies suggesting that if you somehow could avoid the skin say by injections or orally you could induce tolerance to the resin
4059437 could roll around in poison ivy and not have problems
4059438 this one subject who had always gotten bad poison ivy every summer was sure that he had gotten the active pill
4059439 when the study was over and we checked to see whod gotten what we learned that indeed hed been on the placebo
4059440 i tell patients that the skin is armed and dangerous
4059441 that tricks the immune system into thinking boy this is something really dangerous and we have to remember this and the next time we see it were going to attack it

4059490 we all find success when we realize our own dreams
4059491 for certain events the most important thing is to learn the result instantly
4059492 thats exactly the case with mobile tv and the olympics
4059493 tv will become a standard feature for cellphones in china by the end of this year just like cameras
4059494 the original plan was to distribute the phones after the games
4059495 however china mobile decided to do it before the games kicked off because they think the development of mobile tv technology has already reached a satisfactory level
4059496 nowadays peoples attention and time is segmented so they want multi functional converged handsets
4059497 so copying tv content to mobile phones is attractive to many people
4059498 if you have a boom peoplell have money to spend so you have customers
4059499 when you have a downturn you have more customers because they have nothing to do

4059504 if its a friend who does this a lot and it really puts you out remind them that your time is just as valuable as theirs
4059505 in new york they wait until the agreed meeting time and then they go were more laid back and tolerate more than we probably should
4059506 if were talking about someone who is chronically late they might be avoiding anxiety or anger or resisting something

4059514 having this disease with the funny name that no one knows about you feel very isolated
4059515 i couldnt talk id be coughing so hard and itd go on for 15 or 20 minutes they kept giving me stuff and none of it would help
4059516 im sorry to see him gone but hes bringing a lot of awareness of sarcoidosis to the forefront and thats a good thing
4059517 the hardest thing for me is doctors still arent really sure how to treat sarcoidosis symptoms
4059518 theres a lot of research on what to do for other diseases but not for this one so it can be hard to get the proper treatment

4059526 ea has had an extremely successful sports brand for years but were evolving with new experiences targeting new consumers in our space
4059527 theres a hunger that fuels our teams to challenge to be the leading sports brand in the world
4059528 we need to knock down the barriers to those who find the learning curve of our games too steep and find new areas in sports and health and wellness that our brand can truly make a difference

4059542 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4059543 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4059544 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4059545 our plan that we had from the trials onwards was that we would use four swimmers last night and four fresh swimmers this morning
4059546 its a real jigsaw puzzle that youve got to try to get right
4059547 we just had to make some decisions on who we thought was going to give us the best lead the best strategies to put everyone together
4059548 in the end its probably a little bit of tactics a little bit of foresight and a little bit of hope and the girls certainly put it all together today
4059549 i definitely didnt expect the results ive gotten from these olympics
4059550 but to finish with the relay and being a part of the australian team was such a great experience for me
4059551 just being part of the team is something to be proud of
4059552 in 2001 we had such a good team but it was just unfortunate that we got disqualified
4059553 weve worked hard since then for seven years now and got our relay change overs and training happening
4059554 weve got a good group of girls here that did the job here this morning
4059555 but im pretty sure my expression would have said it all

4059560 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4059561 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4059562 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4059563 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4059564 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4059565 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4059566 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4059567 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4059568 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4059569 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4059570 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4059571 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4059572 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4059573 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4059574 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4059575 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4059576 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4059577 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4059578 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4059579 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4059580 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4059581 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4059582 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4059583 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4059584 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4059585 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4059586 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4059587 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4059588 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4059589 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4059590 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4059591 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4059592 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4059593 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4059594 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4059595 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4059596 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4059597 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4059598 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4059599 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4059600 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4059601 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4059602 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4059603 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4059604 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4059605 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4059606 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4059607 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4059608 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4059609 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4059610 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4059611 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4059612 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4059613 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4059614 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4059615 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4059616 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4059617 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4059618 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4059619 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4059620 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4059621 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4059622 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4059623 who are open to doing something on the production side
4059624 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4059625 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4059626 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4059627 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4059628 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4059629 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4059630 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4059631 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4059632 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4059633 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4059634 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4059635 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4059636 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4059637 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4059638 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4059639 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4059640 will something be done ahead of the second leg certainly yes but before saturday no
4059641 realistically there are problems with such a new circuit but the same would be so even for a permanent facility
4059642 the important thing is that there is the will to address the problems and that we know how to do it
4059643 i do not know if it is my final year i look at it from year to year
4059644 if everyone is happy okay but if you are faced with injuries and you miss long periods then you have a different outlook
4059645 i could play a very steady season and do well or the club might no longer be satisfied
4059646 a bid came in last night and it was immediately rejected
4059647 various manchester city officials have been advised on a number of occasions that the player would not be for sale
4059648 for certain events the most important thing is to learn the result instantly
4059649 thats exactly the case with mobile tv and the olympics
4059650 tv will become a standard feature for cellphones in china by the end of this year just like cameras
4059651 the original plan was to distribute the phones after the games
4059652 however china mobile decided to do it before the games kicked off because they think the development of mobile tv technology has already reached a satisfactory level
4059653 nowadays peoples attention and time is segmented so they want multi functional converged handsets
4059654 so copying tv content to mobile phones is attractive to many people
4059655 if you have a boom peoplell have money to spend so you have customers
4059656 when you have a downturn you have more customers because they have nothing to do
4059657 my specialist geoff graham was pleased with my progress and now its mainly a question of building up the strength in my arm

4059662 there is no competition as far as sales go not in a tightrope fashion which you seem to see it
4059663 yes thats the only thing who can get to the highest first thats the only real competition who can do the best who can cater to more audience alright thats not what im saying last month mgs4 came out and it increased ps3 numbers severely but doesnt that by your theory mean those people who didnt buy the ps3 would have bought a 360 so therefore wouldnt the sales of the 360 go down
4059664 no a million people dont act like one person as example one might be appealed a more than b and he will get a but for that same exact reason a person across the globe will be appealed to b more than a and will buy b so did the person selling b or a lose a sale no because before that neither a or b would have been sold
4059665 so in practice when the littlebitplanet campaign sets in people who will look at the system and if it interests them buy the guy while the people who bought the wiis so far arent going to look at littlebigplanet and ask themselves whether they should get the wii or not theyll do it anyway
4059666 its not just one person buying everything so just because more people will buy the ps3 if littlebigplanet comes out doesnt mean less people will buy the wii at the same time
4059667 im claiming if ps3 is more competitive it could be sold before wii or that wii could not be sold because of that what
4059668 georgias actions supported by disinformation by leading american and british media once more confirm that georgia was and still is considering the use of force in resolving the georgia abkhazia conflict
4059669 abkhazia considers it essential to keep a substantial contingent of russian peacekeepers present on its territory as only russia can guarantee the preservation of the abkhazian people and stability in the whole region
4059670 in particular the un security council and the osce have proved helpless and incompetent in urgent conflict prevention
4059671 our motivations and ambitions of course are to continue on all three platforms

4059677 the hd curve is spectacular and the conversion is happening so we see that as a natural marketing campaign
4059678 there is no competition as far as sales go not in a tightrope fashion which you seem to see it

4059696 the hd curve is spectacular and the conversion is happening so we see that as a natural marketing campaign
4059697 there is no competition as far as sales go not in a tightrope fashion which you seem to see it
4059698 yes thats the only thing who can get to the highest first thats the only real competition who can do the best who can cater to more audience alright thats not what im saying last month mgs4 came out and it increased ps3 numbers severely but doesnt that by your theory mean those people who didnt buy the ps3 would have bought a 360 so therefore wouldnt the sales of the 360 go down
4059699 no a million people dont act like one person as example one might be appealed a more than b and he will get a but for that same exact reason a person across the globe will be appealed to b more than a and will buy b so did the person selling b or a lose a sale no because before that neither a or b would have been sold
4059700 so in practice when the littlebitplanet campaign sets in people who will look at the system and if it interests them buy the guy while the people who bought the wiis so far arent going to look at littlebigplanet and ask themselves whether they should get the wii or not theyll do it anyway
4059701 its not just one person buying everything so just because more people will buy the ps3 if littlebigplanet comes out doesnt mean less people will buy the wii at the same time
4059702 im claiming if ps3 is more competitive it could be sold before wii or that wii could not be sold because of that what

4059717 so what can taxpayers expect from an increase in the feds discretionary authority over investment banks the likely answer is rescues delays and lax supervision followed by taxpayer financed bailouts throughout its postwar history the fed has responded to the interests of large banks and congress not the public investment banks dont need the fed to regulate them some clear rules on capitalization would suffice

4059741 i took an fbi course in psychology at quantico va and the instructor said that when youre the chief every day you should soar in like an eagle whether youre getting a divorce or your kids wrecked the car or you have cancer or whatever your problems you should walk in and make people glad to be there
4059742 one of the things i am proudest of as chief is that in 10 years of dealing with the school district they have a lot of issues and stresses of which im sure im not aware but we have been able to find areas of mutual concern
4059743 cissy bowman the head of media relations and communications has been a great partner with us we now put out joint press releases in some cases if the school district and the municipality put out the same message first of all it has a calming effect and second it demonstrates that local government is working on all levels

4059879 sadly london just like washington has been captured by the neoconservatives these are not conservatives new or old they are simply warmongers they have misread the history of the twentieth century for them national greatness is measured by military power they are allied to business and other interests that benefit from war they had a fine time during the cold war they were disappointed when this abruptly ended they have since then been lying us into smaller wars all over the world they want a permanent war with islam they look forward to a cold war with china of course now that vladimir putin is in charge of russia they are in love with the idea that the original cold war never really ended and that the warm certainties of their youth can now be revived what passes in the conservative party for thinking about foreign policy is dominated by these people

4059920 the team has now set standards and it is up to us to meet them it is up to us to move forward the likes of munster and leinster are leading things in ireland and we have to be up there with them
4059921 i picked up a niggling leg injury during pre season but picked up a niggling injury and it stopped me running but im fine now the pre season training is as high quality as i have encountered

4059932 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
4059933 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
4059934 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
4059935 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4059936 so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4059937 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl
4059938 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4059939 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4059940 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
4059941 theyre still the best of friends but any romantic spark has well and truly gone its really sad but theres no one else involved
4059942 shes glad she got back together with him to give things another go she was desperate to save their relationship but at the end of the day it just wasnt to be
4059943 theyre both comfortable with the situation and kelly seems to be quite looking forward to being a single girl again

4059946 singh is which released last week is still going strong and would be the first choice of family audiences during the festival weekend
4059947 bachna ae is only for the young audience vis vis god tussi which is a film for the masses because of salman khans presence
4059948 there has also been no pre release tempo preceding both the films even their music has not made a mark in comparison to the music of singh is kinng that is still driving people crazy
4059949 there is a good pre release response to all the three movies however it is true that singh is is still managing high sales
4059950 singh is going strong in its second week and is expected to keep on garnering sales but we have divided our screens equally for all the three movies
4059951 we are expecting a good business with bachna ae because of the yash raj banner in comparison to god tussi but singh is is still getting us business of around 70 percent even on weekdays
4059952 nothing affects the ticket sales it is tough but it depends on the film if an individual has to go for a film then he or she will definitely go for it come what may
4059953 i dont fear any movie there is nobody greater than god and i have my faith in him my movie is commercial but different the audience would come to know of it when they will watch it
4059954 there are a lot of expectations from both the movies both are big projects and have big stars it would be a great holiday period and the movies are expected to do great business
4059955 however what movie fares well at the box office depends upon the content that is the driving force of a film
