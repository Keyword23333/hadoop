8580000 if at some point in the process it appeared that the clients had a conflict the clients would have to resolve that dispute or negation point on their own
8580001 well youve got to give him that hes got a set on him
8580002 an idiot with 8 years on the job is still a fucking idiot
8580003 i got a letter from the commissioner aug 11 strongly encouraging us to consider forming a regional school unit rsu or an alternative organizational structure aos with kittery
8580004 she said neither wells nor kittery is an approved configuration
8580005 in kitterys case they cannot be approved as they are because of the way the law is written
8580006 they have fewer than 1 200 students in the case of wells they have over 1 200 students but fewer then 2 500 the commissioner was not sufficiently convinced theyd be able to sustain the educational component
8580007 theyd probably keep separate school bus depots because of the distance but there are other areas
8580008 look at the administrative staff could you share a business office were not really talking about teaching staff but administrative functions payroll is a great example
8580009 they started to get together immediately as a result they had a plan that got approved in june they created a system theyre proud of
8580010 i have knocked on 600 doors in town so far
8580011 my goal is to hit between 1 500 and 2 000
8580012 the second year was a whole different feeling you quickly realize that people are gearing up to run again so the desire to work together isnt as great people were paying more attention to how a vote will look
8580013 going through tax reform was a tough thing to do
8580014 no matter how good the package might have been if we couldnt get an agreement from the democrats that any future increases needed a two thirds vote of the legislature we couldnt agree to support it thats what happened
8580015 a reduction in spending is the other half of the equation
8580016 we need tax reform but we also must reduce the increase in spending it has to go hand in hand or it wont work
8580017 i think were getting close one of my biggest disappointments was the passage of the tax to support dirigo i truly believe thats money raised on the backs of maine people and spent on a program thats a failure we need to cover these people but we need to do it by opening up the free market to insurers by eliminating the guaranteed coverage for all mandate we came very close to passing that in the last term
8580018 this was a dream from the beginning of when we opened the museum
8580019 we formed a dory committee and hired boat builder bob eger who has a shop in south berwick we had a lot of volunteers that went there to help him build it
8580020 the volunteers are getting the inside ready and then will flip it and do the exterior
8580021 it will be deep green on the bottom with two yellow stripes on top those were the traditional colors
8580022 he had his shop in the place behind where the camera shop on shore road is
8580023 he launched the boats at the end of wharf lane there were a lot of wharfs there originally
8580024 she designed it from pictures there was no plan of a dory anywhere but plenty of pictures
8580025 weve been a good risk and the pool had money left over so it returned some to the town
8580026 weve tried to keep up with risk management training and other mma training and we try not to have accidents
8580027 the property and casualty policy also has a clause to cover any litigation against the town and public officials liability
8580028 its limited at best at this point because the charging officer has not had a chance to finalize the report
8580029 as i understand it the board does not have standing to remove her from her position so we are not looking at that as an option
8580030 the filling originally started around 1986 here it is 20 years later and its still going on
8580031 the many many trucks coming and going are a danger to the town
8580032 they keep tracking clay and other materials out onto goodwin road
8580033 if youre up there and watch a truck being unloaded youll see a cloud of dust that comes up
8580034 we are concerned about the possibility that unacceptable debris is getting inadvertently or maliciously mixed in with the fill in a way thats difficult to detect and could end up poisoning the ground and groundwater
8580035 i dont have a lot of concern about material itself in terms of health or environmental hazards it might pose
8580036 there has been a lot of confusion about the issue and im hoping to clear some of this up
8580037 i was deeply honored to be recognized and it has taken a lot of extra time and effort and i will continue to do it
8580038 sharon has led the charge in many cases and asked that the reliability continue to be considered and what cost it will have on the consumer
8580039 she has been instrumental in helping draft and write legislation that will benefit the consumer
8580040 its an incredibly time consuming and demanding task she is someone who is dedicated to rolling up their sleeves and seeing that things get done
8580041 maines stunning coastline attracts tourists from around the world every summer boosting the local economy and creating summer jobs for thousands of mainers

8580043 because of tribalism and corruption every tribe is demanding its own district they think this will make them powerful
8580044 people complained that power was too far so we decided to create more districts for them
8580045 but i think we have gone too far the districts are too many and being created too fast
8580046 the pineapple companies tell us the water is clean but the government wont let us drink it

8580133 the start and finish is right in market square so its a long rectangle right through downtown
8580134 each lap takes only two to three minutes to do so its a good race for spectators its not more than every few minutes before you see us go by again
8580135 the whole pretense of the event is promoting a healthy lifestyle and getting families together
8580136 its a sporting event yes but we knew right away we couldnt close off the downtown streets without taking advantage of it and making this into a festival
8580137 if you started riding a road bike it will probably become sort of addictive
8580138 the best way to get into it is to go to a local shop and ask about rides in the area see what it is to go fast before you go to your first race

8580140 the rapid success of the arab invaders was largely due to the welcome they received from the native christians who hated the byzantine rule not only for its oppressive administration but also and chiefly on account of the bitterness of theological rancour the jacobites who formed the majority of the christian population had been very roughly handled by the orthodox adherents of the courts and subjected to indignities that have not been forgotten by their children even to the present day some were tortured and then thrown into the sea many followed their patriarch into exile to escape from the hands of their persecutors while a large number disguised their opinions under a pretended acceptance of the council of chalcedon

8580194 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8580195 look at the example the republicans have set in this decade american workers have consistently given us rising productivity that means year after year they work harder and produce more
8580196 now what did they get in return declining wages less than one fourth as many new jobs as in the previous eight years smaller health care and pension benefits rising poverty and the biggest increase in income inequality since the 1920s american families by the millions are struggling with soaring health care costs and declining coverage
8580197 they republicans took us from record surpluses to an exploding debt from over 22 million new jobs to just 5 million from increasing working families incomes to nearly 7 500 a year to a decline of more than 2 000 a year from almost 8 million americans lifted out of poverty to more than 5

8580222 cisf head constable sher singh mistook the woman for a man due to her clothes and tried to drag her out while she was standing in the queue for women the woman slapped sher singh and while he was trying to save himself his hand accidentally broke a button of her clothes
8580223 however as soon as he realised he was dealing with a woman he withdrew his hand and apologized but the woman feeling humiliated started shouting and called police
8580224 pakistan had approached some countries including india to support the board in organising a triangular or quadrangular tournament in south africa to fill in the gap left open in pakistans cricket calender with the postponement of the champions trophy
8580225 now the modalities including venues and dates for the tri series is being worked out but tentatively it should start from september 12
8580226 we are not going to adopt a tit for tat policy because the decision to postpone champions trophy was in the end unanimous people dont realise that pakistan has still got the hosting rights and it was because of the strong stand taken by some boards that the tournament was not relocated to sri lanka
8580227 i was watching their hands especially mendis my plan was that if i can read his hand i can play well that was the game plan
8580228 i think i was able to read both murali and mendis well scoring 76 and helping my team win is satisfying
8580229 whenever we are at the nets or batting together he tells me how to plan he is such a class reader of the game he always plays with responsibility we learn a lot from him while batting with him it is good we got partnerships in two matches
8580230 since we lost the final of asia cup in pakistan we were very keen to do well in sri lanka we put up a good show here and won a historic series
8580231 i am getting into good shape now and thanks to the people who gave me support coach such as robin singh coach gary kirsten venkatesh prasad and others they gave me lots of support hopefully i will remain with the same intensity
8580232 i think i have also improved a lot after playing the ipl i learnt a lot from there my batting is coming on well the hesitation of playing big shots also seems to have gone from the mind
8580233 the sri lankans also have a good batting line up they could have scored more runs butfor playing under the lights
8580234 it was a good toss to win there was something in the wicket for the spinners and they got a lot of turn even the pacers did well
8580235 the toss proved crucial it put the indians in an advantageous position but i should say we made too many mistake along the way there was lack of consistent partnership from the batters and that did not help the team at all

8580240 kamal nath has said something but as a central minister i want to make it clear that the union government will not take the responsibility of bailing out the west bengal government from the singur crisis
8580241 the policy under which the land was acquired in singur was formulated by the nda regime and not by the upa dasmunshi claimed adding that the upa was against acquisition of fertile land favoured economic and social rehabilitation package for land losers and direct talks between entrepreneurs and land owners in deciding the price of land

8580265 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8580266 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8580267 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8580268 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8580269 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8580293 ramping a term used for when patients have to wait in ambulances outside the hospital when there are no free beds
8580294 i certainly know theyve died in the hospital and sitting in the back of the ambulance car has contributed to that mr dutton said today
8580295 theres numerous cases we can talk about where people have been revived from cardiac arrest who have had to wait outside the hospital for up to an hour before they can actually be seen in the hospital
8580296 ramped outside emergency wards but he said the situation would only get worse
8580297 the community of queensland needs to realise this is not the ambulance drivers fault its queensland healths fault
8580298 thats fantastic thats a great effort but theyre not going to be any good if we cant get them to the jobs get them away from the hospitals
8580299 we provide a very professional standard of care but obviously thats limited to what were trained to do
8580300 these people need to go to the next level thats why we have doctors and nurses to extend the level of care
8580301 thats the other side of ramping while its uncomfortable and inconvenient for people sitting in the ambulance its absolutely risking their health and wellbeing by not receiving the level of care they deserve
8580302 theyre the ones receiving the triple 0 phone calls and theyre the ones who then have to make a decision where theyre going to get an ambulance from
8580303 in some ways communications staff are the unsung heroes of this whole process

8580306 close tight knit group was hoping to go back tomorrow and use the memory of priestley to get through it she said
8580307 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy the spokeswoman said
8580308 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married the spokeswoman said
8580309 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8580310 no one loved her doing it more than mark he was thrilled she said
8580311 the cast have been rocked by two tragedies the seven spokeswoman said
8580312 he could be quite a handful at times but he had the most extraordinary combination of very deft comedic touch and great emotional depth said howard who plays dr frank campion
8580313 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him he said
8580314 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8580315 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8580316 i think his speech was directed at other australian states and not at victoria john brumby said in melbourne

8580321 mr rudd has the power now to withhold money from states that have not complied with this and the challenge for him is will he do so

8580324 the pumping of acid into the soil and aquifers will leave behind acid and radioactive wastes in some of the aquifers within the mine lease for many years mr noonan said
8580325 its actually causing greater environmental impact over a larger area
8580326 it is incredibly disappointing to see peter garrett of all people allowing such a thing to take place given the current state of water in australia and in south australia in particular senator ludlam said
8580327 it should be completely unacceptable in this day and age
8580328 i am satisfied that the tough conditions attached to this approval will ensure the highest standards of environmental management by the mine operator mr garrett said
8580329 my decision demonstrates the governments commitment to ensuring worlds best practice environmental standards for uranium mining in this country
8580330 the way in which heathgate resources manages mining fluids and the disposal of liquid wastes has been confirmed by the csiro and geoscience australia as worlds best practice and endorsed by the chief scientist mr garrett said

8580335 active role in resolving the conflict in georgia according to the draft of a joint statement released by the kremlin
8580336 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia said the statement from britain canada france germany italy japan and the united states
8580337 they had a frank exchange of views the spokeswoman for smith said
8580338 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began
8580339 they will live to regret it shevardnadze said in an interview in japans
8580340 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8580341 he has a big responsibility not to start one he added
8580342 certainly some measures of precaution are being taken said a spokesman for prime minister vladimir putin dmitry peskov
8580343 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8580344 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states peskov said

8580347 i have been considering this for some time but felt it was important not to announce my departure before the festival so as to not impact on this years festival
8580348 following discussion with the board i have now decided to step down with immediate effect but i would like to stress that i will contribute fully to the independent review of the box office which was announced earlier this month
8580349 date of november 21st the pressure is higher for the cast and crew of
8580350 they liked it so much they are bringing us back for some encore time to beef it up
8580351 it gives us a little bit of history of the cullen family they are just shooting a couple of different added scenes and the scene im in i can tell you its me and robert pattinson rosalie and emmett are in that scene
8580352 well i am going to be in the prom scene now at the very end of the film
8580353 at first we didnt film that and now some people are saying they want to see a bit more of jacob and they want him in the prom scene at the end
8580354 surely this is not a work of art but a blashphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that upsets many people
8580355 wounds the religious sentiments of so many people who see in the cross the symbol of gods love
8580356 residents who are being plagued with noise from their neighbours loud parties or late night diy need not suffer through it
8580357 we have a well publicised popular service which people know they can turn to when faced with noise problems like these
8580358 the council in the past has tried to put noise levellers in which cut the electricity supply to the socket which the pa system is plugged into if it exceeds a certain level
8580359 this isnt the best way of doing things as they tend to respond more sensitively to tones rather than actual noise
8580360 the council does have a night noise team and perhaps people are more comfortable calling them when in the past they would have knocked on the neighbours door and asked if they would mind turning the music down a bit
8580361 i went downstairs and opened the living room door and was confronted by the living room on fire i closed the door and shouted upstairs to the rest of the family to get out
8580362 i didnt realise they were trying to leave upstairs but they were restrained by the flames at the top of the window they came downstairs and got out the front door
8580363 i was using a cushion i couldnt put the fire out so i crawled through to the kitchen soaked a towel and came back and managed to put out the flames
8580364 after everything had calmed down and we were all outside safely we realised there had been a petrol bomb put through the window
8580365 as soon as i saw the re run of the television evidence i knew exactly who it was it was andrew brown
8580366 we have lost the appeal that means he will be extradited it will probably be within the next fortnight
8580367 he is absolutely devastated by the decision he and his family are distraught they are completely beside themselves he is terrified by the prospect of going to america
8580368 this was their last chance we are going to write to the secretary of state and ask her to reconsider it again
8580369 the caltongate plans should have been refused by this council at the first opportunity
8580370 the biggest concern is the effect this will have on the citys world heritage status yet i was told at the last meeting on this subject that it was scaremongering to suggest that this development could cost us that
8580371 if we feel we need modern developments in a gap site we will take the decision
8580372 it would be illogical to stop a development that we have carefully considered
8580373 im not surprised although i had hoped they might consider it in a bit more detail we will now be urging ministers to order a full public inquiry
8580374 caltongate offers a once in a generation opportunity to significantly improve the fabric and feature of edinburghs old town
8580375 we are starting to see more of a buyers market develop with the average premium now at 17 per cent ten per cent lower than last year we expect that to start to translate into a fall in average prices
8580376 if we continue to see what has been seen recently we would certainly expect the average price to come down there have been a lot more fixed prices and more sales below fixed prices
8580377 sellers are now accepting that the market has changed for a long time that did not happen that will have an impact on the prices they are expecting
8580378 the fall in the number of houses being sold is down to the unprecedented situation on liquidity people have also put properties on the market and seen them stall because they have unrealistic expectations
8580379 i dont believe we have a long term problem like america where there are too many properties because there is still more demand than supply in some areas
8580380 if someone came to me with a new build bought last year id say youll probably be deflated because the price is down considerably but if it is a good property in trinity or a family home they are still selling fairly well
8580381 the difficulty with these statistics is that they hide a lot of factors what we have seen is a very different market where the higher value properties are much easier to sell
8580382 the majority of these mid top end buyers have probably already built up a lot of equity and will not look at properties that require as big a mortgage as the lower end
8580383 this years event marks a step change for the melas entry into edinburghs festival calendar it is the boldest programme we have ever presented and has extended across many more cultures than previously
8580384 the mela this year offers a world of creative talent traditional indian dance will sit beside tango and flamenco troupes
8580385 the big top will host an aerial circus act and the rhythms of india and pakistan will be joined by those from japan africa and elsewhere upswing aerial have devised a breathtaking display of circus acrobatics and the london community gospel choir will add their infectious singing to the party atmosphere
8580386 we didnt mind the economic side so much but we didnt like the social side at all
8580387 thatchers economics had at their core the belief that mass unemployment was not just a price worth paying but necessary in a modern economy
8580388 i was commenting on why scots in particular were so deeply resentful of thatcher and i think here her social message epitomised in the unfair poll tax and her comments of no such thing as society cut against a very scottish grain of social conscience
8580389 that doesnt mean that the nation liked her economic policies just that we liked her lack of concern for social consequences even less
8580390 it wasnt a slip its what he believes he was sitting having a cosy chat with a rising star of the tory party who isnt a real journalist he must have felt very comfortable and he just came out with it
8580391 the snp has managed to convince a large section of scots that they are more left wing than labour
8580392 but being relaxed about thatchers economic policies does let the cat out of the bag and its consistent with their pro business low tax stance
8580393 the snp wants irish levels of taxation and scandinavian levels of public services but there is a contradiction there and they cant quite make up their minds
8580394 whereas at uk level labour talked right to act left because its centre right aspirational voters who decide elections in scotland which is traditionally left of centre the snp talks left to act right
8580395 that was a bigger sea change than many people realised at the time the tories were no longer the bogeymen we could do deals with them
8580396 the party has not tied up its economic and social justice arguments there are a lot of short term fixes going on we need to do a bit more thinking

8580400 its an aircraft that zoom had leased and the company that owns the aircraft has terminated their lease agreement with zoom
8580401 clearly the service suppliers are out there saying look we dont have the confidence going forward that youll be able to pay your past debts
8580402 the lead domino in this is really the fuel companies
8580403 were seeing the front end of a canadian carrier seeing some difficulties
8580404 the aircraft that was scheduled for your flight today is no longer available
8580405 we have tried to determine to what extent place matters
8580406 happiness is particularly difficult for a scientist to measure theres a lot of lively debate on what is the most appropriate measure
8580407 this is the first time in britain at least that there has been an attempt to take geography into account
8580408 the difference between areas is very small a lot of the difference is down to the make up of the people living there not just the area
8580409 it means people are less happy than we would expect them to be maybe miserable would be the right word
8580410 this is very surprising it is certainly not a description of edinburgh i recognise
8580411 i am not originally from edinburgh i came to the city 15 years ago and i have always found it to be a lively and vibrant place to live and work in i was at an event for the mela last night and what this research is saying does not square with what was going on there
8580412 its just a massive increase in one day i dont think we can cope with that it would mean laying someone off
8580413 i wouldnt have thought the council could turn round and say weve not increased our rents in seven years so we are going to do it all in one day its a particularly numb feeling at the moment its almost a position of being bullied
8580414 if it was phased in over say three years we could look at other ways of absorbing the cost
8580415 we have been here since 2002 and our rents havent increased in that time we expect gradual increases but it has almost doubled from 288 to 488 a month
8580416 its a lot of money especially for a small business and especially in the current climate its not as if business is booming and were not going to notice it
8580417 a lot of people wont be able to afford that i dont know what to do
8580418 before the council had responsibility for maintaining the outside of the building now we are having to do this theyre upping our rent and making us do all that it does seem a bit unfair
8580419 it is a big increase its a bit of a shock everyone is in the same situation but i think we will just have to bite the bullet
8580420 rent reviews are based on what a property could achieve in rent if it was put on the open market at the time of a review
8580421 based on the evidence from new open market lettings in the peffer business centre in april 2008 we have subsequently proposed rents in line with current market conditions
8580422 if any business can provide evidence to support a lower market rent then we would be happy to consider that information
8580423 edinburgh city centre is the jam in our doughnut but the doughnut is getting bigger developments such as the gyle fort kinnaird ocean terminal and straiton have damaged the city centre
8580424 to allow the city to reclaim its place at the head of local retail means we must forego further developments on the periphery
8580425 this kind of development is long overdue in leith particularly the affordable housing which is doubly welcome
8580426 the security and breadth of our business positions us well for more challenging economic conditions
8580427 we remain confident of further planning progress within our property portfolio as we develop long term value in our property business
8580428 we had such a fantastic day with the army and were really overwhelmed with their kindness craig has had a hard time over the last few years and to get a gift like this made his dreams come true
8580429 he has always wanted to be a soldier he has read all the books seen all the films and even has some of the kit
8580430 we were really welcomed in as friends and were surprised how much effort was put into giving craig a great birthday
8580431 we are always keen to help anyone who has an interest in the army especially if they are youngsters and it has been a lifelong one
8580432 the royal highland fusiliers who are based at glencorse are out fighting battles every day but it is nothing compared to the battle this young man has fought

8580449 part of the vast tragic swathe of eastern europe where nazi racial ideology was most fully brutally realized and where those who survived it existed for 45 years in a kind of chocked soviet stasis

8580455 you have to pinch yourself the surreal thing is that all ive done is win a bike race its what i do its my job ive won things before and no one knows about it you do the same thing again and you get back home and the whole world knows about it

8580461 edinburgh has come out in force for chris hoy and scotlands athletes it has been a staggering success and everyone who came out today had a fantastic time
8580462 the huge turnout at the royal mile is a sign of how proud edinburgh people are of our athletes and of the massive impact that chris hoy has made on the global stage
8580463 there are just so many people who have been through there and now theyre sportsmen and champions to waste it now after all that work is dreadful really they deserve everything its lovely to have a nice turnout and for everybody to be so happy and proud
8580464 these decisions are never taken lightly as weve worked hard to set the routes up
8580465 we would never say never but i think it would be wrong to say we hope to reintroduce them the routes soon we dont want to put any high hopes into agents heads that they will be reintroduced
8580466 gt mike bliss poses in his greece home last friday five months after he was attacked and left paralyzed in buffalo hes slowly regaining the use of his body
8580467 we keep hoping because little things keep coming back and we work very hard
8580468 we work hard with him were not going to give up
8580469 it was really scary because there were a few times where i thought we might lose him
8580470 i wasnt really thinking about if he would walk again i was thinking about if he would live
8580471 we dont want to ever look back and say we didnt do enough

8580504 football is a team game and i want all my outfield players to score goals
8580505 the defenders will come up for set pieces and i hope they can get on the end of a good cross and hurt the opposition
8580506 the midfielders are also capable of scoring and while we want davids phenomenal form to continue it is important that we do well as a team and i will be preaching the need for us to score goals from all over the park
8580507 hopefully the other lads can take the pressure off david and if they can do that our goals tally should look a lot better

8580519 mr benn was amazingly open he said our discussion was already spinning off ideas
8580520 we looked at the problem with the exit on friday night he wasnt at reading he was at leeds but he got a call from his deputy in reading saying he couldnt get people out
8580521 he said as far as the team was concerned the friday night was the worst ever in terms of crowd control at reading
8580522 he said he thought it was because rage against the machine were playing and everyone wanted to see them this caused a bottleneck getting out
8580523 next year he said he was putting a spotter in the crowd who can communicate with both the safety team and the audience
8580524 i was very pleasantly surprised at how receptive melvin was to ideas of ways to improve safety
8580525 we discussed my list of concerns for more than an hour and we will be meeting to discuss matters in more detail with his safety team
8580526 he said it was just the friday there was a problematic exit
8580527 he is going to look at the spill out area for the main stage and increase it next year its already doubled since 2005
8580528 normally there is a one way system melvin said he didnt know why there wasnt this year but they would be reverting to it next year
8580529 he is also looking at changing and increasing the number of signs on the site and on the maps of the site
8580530 he seemed genuinely keen and excited to talk to me and said it prompted ideas
8580531 he added and he did not want to seem patronising that he has a paternal view of his own staff and festival goers
8580532 he said he cared a lot about the people who come to reading
8580533 we look foward to a wide ranging debate on these issues

8580535 as a young entrepreneur you will have no work life balance i am very serious about this if you want to succeed you need to be working 24 7 every day of the week
8580536 its easy to be happy for a year or two working all day every day in my opinion its hard to be happy doing that for a lifetime one day youll wake up at age 50 and realize that youve missed out on love and relationships and wonderful experiences because you were obsessed with your company
8580537 adam youve spent a lot of time on this blog advocating the fact that this is not true and that entrepreneurs need to try as hard as possible to sidestep that misconception
8580538 in a world where people are moving a million miles per minute how can you actually tell what someone really cares about look at their calendar its that simple your calendar never lies all we have is our time the way we spend our time is our priorities is our strategy your calendar knows what you really care about do you

8580553 were going to keep our commitments to afghanistan and iraq as we have pledged to do
8580554 for the sake of our freedom and security we must not relent until this enemy is destroyed
8580555 were gathering better intelligence because now the iraqis are less afraid to pass along tips about where enemy fighters are hiding and where they keep their weapons
8580556 is substantially degraded running out of sanctuaries losing the fight
8580557 has given iraqs elected leaders the breathing room to pass new reforms and theyve stepped up to their responsibilities
8580558 are able to lead more and more operations on their own
8580559 weve brought home all five of the combat brigades and the three marine units who were sent into iraq as part of the surge
8580560 further troop movements will as always depend on what is happening on the ground
8580561 ive had no greater privilege than the chance to work with members of the american armed forces
8580562 i believe that if anyone lacks for inspiration in the war on terror they need look no farther than the men and women who do the fighting
8580563 whether its on cold mountain peaks in afghanistan or the hot dusty streets of iraq they have been magnificent
8580564 and a new generation of warriors is the next chapter of american ingenuity bravery and valor
8580565 we have served those principles and sacrificed for them to the far corners of the earth
8580566 we have thrown back tyrants stood watch on the frontiers of freedom and defended the weak against the violent
8580567 weve done all this not for glory or empire but for freedom because we know that the spread of freedom makes our world safer and brings us closer to the peace we all desire
8580568 in the process weve received more than our share of criticism and we can take it
8580569 is a better place because of the power the influence and the values of the united states of america
8580570 very disturbed by mr ayers past and by his refusal to disavow what the did the implications of this for obama are zero
8580571 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
8580572 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
8580573 it states the mccain campaign is running an ad on the issue and its not obama described ayers as just a guy who lives in his neighborhood we know thats not accurate
8580574 the notion that me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense

8580581 you know why because obama has said all along its not going to be cakewalk its not a blow out its going to be tight
8580582 theres a plan theres a strategy and im with it
8580583 we already know he is a rock star we already know he can bring 85 000 people together in a stadium he has done it multiple times he needs to talk to people who havent made up their minds yet
8580584 its likely that the campaign would do it differently if it had to do it again because the decision was made before the european trip
8580585 i have heard some of the concerns and criticism that its such a big venue
8580586 its no surprise that people could be a little nervous were trying to do something new

8580595 it might just be me but i detected notes of condescension
8580596 this is not a judgment about who was right and who was wrong in this arcane fight its a strategic point about what kind of attitude and effort it will take to reunite a party whose voters have been split down the middle
8580597 obama lost my vote when he used the race card during the primaries
8580598 this is yet another bloodless analysis that conflicts with what everybody else saw
8580599 we would have an immigration policy that brings 12 million people out of the shadows
8580600 we all know our countrys journey toward equality isnt finished yet we have more work to do

8580602 the six party talks process is facing an opportunity to move forward further but at the same time there are difficulties that must be overcome jointly by relevant parties

8580604 same failed bush mccain economic policies in florida that have already driven the american economy into a recession

8580608 active role in resolving the conflict in georgia according to the draft of a joint statement released by the kremlin
8580609 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia said the statement from britain canada france germany italy japan and the united states
8580610 they had a frank exchange of views the spokeswoman for smith said
8580611 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began
8580612 they will live to regret it shevardnadze said in an interview in japans
8580613 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8580614 he has a big responsibility not to start one he added
8580615 certainly some measures of precaution are being taken said a spokesman for prime minister vladimir putin dmitry peskov
8580616 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8580617 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states peskov said
8580618 united position of a summit of central asian nations would serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white
8580619 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8580620 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8580621 his life is a 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8580622 his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the more perfect union of our founders dreams
8580623 we see that humanity that strength and our future in barack and michelle obama and their beautiful children
8580624 she didnt want to be seen as bills third term
8580625 he was in a rage over how they used him
8580626 he was not used to the 24 7 news cycle and people with cell phones recording what he said at every stop
8580627 but you cant blame bill clinton for the loss at end of the day he was a huge plus
8580628 for starters they will have to reluctantly concede that baracks attacks on bill clintons presidency were wrong
8580629 its not easy to release prisoners especially prisoners that were involved directly in terrorist acts against innocent civilians
8580630 there wont be peace without the release of all the prisoners
8580631 such an idea had come up in one of the dial board meetings recently but it was discouraged by the government representatives there only since it undermined the purpose of a bidding process
8580632 so the proposal never came to the civil aviation ministry
8580633 in accordance with our corporate governance and standards gmr had no intention in the past or now to bid for the dial hospitality project
8580634 there was no such provision in the rfp previously or in the present version as such there is no question or provision of matching any bid by gmr group with or without participation in the bidding process
8580635 its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
8580636 the future of a community a people a church and a nation depends on the children who will inherit it if we prevent our children from being born we remove ourselves from the future its really that simple no children no future
8580637 in the interview tom brokaw reminded you that the church professes the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death
8580638 unfortunately your statement demonstrates a lack of understanding of catholic teaching and belief regarding abortion
8580639 your erroneous claim about the history of the churchs opposition to abortion is false and denigrates our common faith
8580640 to reduce the scandal and consternation caused amongst the faithful by your remarks we necessarily write you to correct the public record and affirm the churchs actual and historical teaching that defends the sanctity of human life
8580641 conscience to the teaching of the church that goes back to the very beginning of the church on this moral issue
8580642 if you are ignorant and you dont know when life begins then you go on the side of safety and protecting rights you dont bomb a city where there might be a lot of civilians you say well im not sure well then be on the side of safety protect the lives of the innocent the non combatants
8580643 you must also go on the side of your ignorance to say then if i dont know then ill protect all the more
8580644 make sure not that there are few and rare abortions but that there are zero abortions and that you would do everything you can to protect life this is the duty of us all
8580645 unwed and abandoned mothers women facing unintended pregnancies and women struggling with the aftermath of an abortion
8580646 so there we have it the man running for president on the democratic ticket supports selective infanticide his running mate is a pro abortion catholic the delegates are wildly out of step with americans on abortion and the speaker of the house hasnt a clue what her religion teaches on the subject
8580647 los senadores gustavo petro y piedad c rdoba a trav s del se or francisco villalba le ofrecieron dinero a cambio de involucrar al presidente de la rep blica en la comisi n de la masacre del aro
8580648 strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
8580649 im proud that for only the second time in our history the planned parenthood action fund has endorsed a candidate for president barack obama
8580650 im proud to say that my party the democratic party is united behind and supports a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
8580651 to see millions of innocent human lives extinguished and then to celebrate that is very disappointing
8580652 even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mothers voice sleep and dream suck their thumbs and play with their toes
8580653 when we tell kids that unborn children can be killed if their parents dont want them we rob them of the knowledge of the god given right to life and we destroy their moral foundation abortion is wrong because its a baby its always wrong to intentionally kill an innocent baby
8580654 struggling for life how our tax dollars and twisted science target the unborn
8580655 the marketing of evil how radicals elitists and pseudo experts sell us corruption disguised as freedom
8580656 that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage and all the people in this country who feel invisible
8580657 i think one day ill be able to meet him and michelle i just dont think its going to be this week
8580658 this song is a pointed attack at people who call themselves christians but act anything far from it
8580659 you know theres some in the party who feel that this gathering isnt tough enough against a john mccain who after all hasnt let up for a day against this party
8580660 to wake up this hall after a speech that was not only not red meat by former governor warner but more like tofu with sprouts
8580661 if he thought the democrats were hitting john mccain hard enough
8580662 we expected a lot of red meat from senator clinton tonight
8580663 amazed why they dont have more fun with the man who calls himself dick cheney
8580664 when are they going to start going after john mccain
8580665 the greatest financial crisis weve had probably since the great depression
8580666 its not surprising that george bush and john mccain will be together in the twin cities because you cant tell them apart
8580667 is there a risk that this negative tone will ultimately hurt mccains brand as a different kind of politician
8580668 hey the price of oil might begin to spike at the pump
8580669 well last night was a mellow night about love and family and teddy getting on
8580670 i watch with amazement as he came to the senate i watch with amazement
8580671 made his mark literally from day one reaching across the aisle to pass legislation to secure the worlds deadliest weapons
8580672 to pass a law that helps keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
8580673 but i was proudest i was proudest when i watched him spontaneously focus the attention of the nation on the shameful neglect of americas wounded warriors at walter reed army hospital
8580674 sen biden has a strong record of opposing judicial nominees with hostile anti choice records
8580675 he voted against george w bushs two anti choice nominees to the u s supreme court john roberts and samuel alito and he opposed anti choice justice clarence thomas nomination to the court as well as multiple anti choice nominees to lower federal courts
8580676 basically joe bidens role on the senate judiciary committee has been as a front man for the far left despite all the talk about his centrism
8580677 spent three decades trying to transform the federal judiciary into a kind of activist oligarchy
8580678 joe biden has had his finger in every tawdry hearing in the senate judiciary committee in my memory
8580679 he has lowered the standard of debate he has politicized the confirmation process he has used his position to defame a number of nominees including bob bork and clarence thomas and theres no road too low that he wont travel
8580680 you can trace back the origins of our current confirmation spectacles to the days when joe biden chaired the judiciary committee for the robert bork and the clarence thomas hearings in 87 and 91
8580681 those particular hearings set the stage for the confirmation wars of today what ironically sen biden now calls a kabuki dance as if he had no hand in creating it
8580682 you have managed to convince conservative kansas republican sen brownback that youre on his side and you have managed to convince liberal massachusetts democratic sen kennedy youre on his side
8580683 were rolling the dice with you judge because you wont share your views with us youve told me nothing in this kabuki dance the public has a right to know what you think
8580684 judge you not only have a right to choose what you will answer and not answer but in my view you should not answer a question of what your view will be on an issue that clearly is going to come before the court in 50 different forms
8580685 judge bork was at the time and is still a distinguished constitutional scholar and government official who held many important posts in the executive branch and in the judiciary and sen biden basically organized a partisan smear campaign against judge bork
8580686 liberal special interest groups worked hand in hand with the liberal members of the judiciary committee to sink bork and biden was in charge of it all
8580687 its important to remember that sen biden was the chairman of the committee during the bork nomination and the thomas confirmation fights
8580688 he very much planned the hearings organized them orchestrated them and caused them to take the form that they did i think it is fair to say that he was the grand inquisitor in the inquisition he was the person really orchestrating the whole show
8580689 there was a lot of time before the hearings to allow outside left wing groups to gin up a political campaign against judge bork in general he treated the bork hearings more as if they were about electing a supreme court justice than about deciding to advise and consent about a presidential nomination
8580690 we went from having a process where the senate gave its advice and consent to nominations to one where the hearings became kind of a mini national election and depending on the full results after the hearing the senate would either ratify the nominee or nor
8580691 the thomas hearings were if anything even worse because they descended into the personal and became really almost a circus because of sen bidens inability to control the hearings
8580692 would be considered on the basis of his qualifications alone
8580693 i think that the only reason clarence thomas is on the court is because he is black i dont believe he could have won had he been white
8580694 hes been a pretty adamant filibusterer and has been very much a party to the filibustering of judicial nominees
8580695 i think that filibustering and failing to give people an up or down vote has been very much a continuation of what started with the bork hearings and the thomas hearings
8580696 these were nominees who were perfectly qualified but for the fact that they were being ideologically attacked fit the standard biden articulated in the 80s which was that he would never vote against someone for ideological reasons alone and he violated that standard when he voted against priscilla owen
8580697 the one thing he has run of importance are those two hearings and he ran them very badly and the judicial confirmation process hasnt been the same since
8580698 the crown prosecution service wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims
8580699 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8580700 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one
8580701 at a minimum it appears that the states economy will continue declining through the rest of 2008 and possibly into 2009
8580702 as new yorks policy makers address the large budget gaps it is imperative that budget actions not worsen the economy and exacerbate the unemployment crisis
8580703 the of middle class families failed to rise above where they were at the peak of previous expansion
8580704 my friend kouchner also said that we will soon attack moldova and ukraine and the crimea but that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well
8580705 the sco states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
8580706 we condemn the action of our fellow g8 member russias recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia
8580707 medvedevs unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8580708 it is not just the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe it is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law
8580709 we dont want a new cold war he has a big responsibility not to start one
8580710 to withdraw its candidate and support the pml n candidate
8580711 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8580712 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8580713 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8580714 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits
8580715 in any job or any career the first year or two youre learning whether its for you
8580716 ive just got to sit my time on the line watching the fence
8580717 i thought it would be an opportunity to get in federal law enforcement
8580718 when they return from the academy the first thing i tell them is that its going to be tough lots of long hours
8580719 ive seen some interns realize after the first couple days that this is a different animal
8580720 the business environment is rapidly becoming more difficult things remain very uncertain not just in the united states but in emerging countries and resource rich nations as well
8580721 given the price of gasoline and the economic situation it is quite difficult to imagine a dramatic improvement in the japanese market
8580722 it might be true that the market is contracting for us but we have to prepare for future growth
8580723 we must ensure that the market does not shrink as a result of price hikes therefore we have decided to limit the number of models that would be affected
8580724 it revolves around money and that money revolves around drugs
8580725 this was the cleanest crime scene ive ever walked on
8580726 we had five people we didnt know who they were why they were there
8580727 it took a significant amount of time to get past that hurdle
8580728 i dont know why two charges when i didnt do anything
8580729 i was out of town when this happened so how can i be charged
8580730 georgian people are strong spiritually and physically and no enemy can break them down let us ask god to deliver us from seen and unseen enemies and turn them all into friends
8580731 today we have a great crisis in georgia a big war is starting i think our patriarch told us to pray every day
8580732 the depression will likely become a tropical storm later thursday and could reach hurricane intensity within three days
8580733 will be positioned in their bases outside the cities and there will not be troops seen patrolling inside the city unless necessary
8580734 if the nato ships continue to stay in the black sea after the expiration of 21 day period then i would like to remind you that
8580735 aip a non profit organization which is presently sponsoring advertisements to which the obama campaign objects
8580736 its not enough that he wants to be president he wants to be zeus
8580737 tomorrow youre going to see obama come down from olympus to be among us mere mortals
8580738 the stage is clearly meant to resemble a typical state house
8580739 krauthammers remarks point out the mass delusionary quality that is central to the obama campaign
8580740 das ist zun chst erst mal eine entscheidung der nords chsischen freundinnen und freunde

8580746 the amount of earnings a worker must give up for gaining health insurance is roughly equal to the amount an employer must pay for such coverage
8580747 people generally like to equate better health with awesomer technology but developing a slightly better drug for late stage cancer a good profitable innovation will do much less for health than getting the flu vaccine to everyone who needs it or creating systems so everyone with elevated cardiac risk is on statins these interventions are low innovation but actually extremely effective saving some level of money on innovation in order to rechannel it to access and basic interventions would probably make the country a whole lot healthier but i dont think youre allowed to say that
8580748 i like watching conventions on television i think the stars there should be the people who have been elected
8580749 in our dance routine we used traditional armenian music and make up our costumes were really bright and colourful we could tell from the judges faces that they really liked it because it was something different
8580750 i have danced since i was two years old my mother was a big influence as she also dreamt of becoming a dancer she has always encouraged me to pursue my dream of being on stage
8580751 sanat is my close friend so i asked her if she wanted to do an act with me we have a lot in common
8580752 my mum always wanted to be a dancer and my dad wanted to be a writer or actor so theyre both quite artistic i want to make them proud of me so if we get any further in the competition i will be really happy
8580753 how many purges do i have to hold before i get some competent

8580760 i took time to pray and gospel melodies kept coming up in my heart
8580761 a central theme of hope and love for jesus christ
8580762 i was so much more comfortable with this project because id been there done that
8580763 im more settled in my thoughts with my lyrics and with what direction i wanted to go with the music and more importantly my relationship with god has evolved into a place of peace
8580764 i have no doubt they were lovers the princess would telephone vicki hodges villa on mustique where bindon was staying and would ask him over to her house this occurred more or less on a nightly basis bindon told me he gave her nine out of 10 for technique in bed and 15 out of 10 for enthusiasm he said she was insatiable
8580765 margaret loved partying in mustique and loved people stripping off according to bindon she used to take photographs of naked limbo dancers
8580766 ik maakte deel uit van een zeer geweldloze organisatie ik heb niets te verbergen
8580767 mijn contract liep afgelopen maandag af en ik heb niks gehoord dus is voor mij de consequentie dat ik niet langer de persoonlijke afgevaardigde ben

8580770 in het verleden werd mondriaan wel beschouwd als de koele mathematicus die systematisch te werk ging nu weten we dat hij weliswaar zeer nauwkeurig was maar toch best experimenteel werkte
8580771 maar ook met het blote oog was al veel waarneembaar victory boogie woogie werd gemeten doorgelicht en geobserveerd zonder het aan te raken
8580772 we tonen morgen op het symposium voor mondriaankenners een versie van het schilderij zonder tape en m t tape we hebben het schilderij digitaal kunnen ontdoen van de dikke plakken tape zo is er een interessante kale reconstructie ontstaan die opmerkelijk ander is de victory boogie woogie die we nu kennen is duidelijk dynamischer door zijn extra vakjes zit er meer ritme en tempo in

8580874 they didnt get on like a house on fire but morgan felt at the time there was common ground between them but it has evaporated since that only one on one meeting and both are now polarised as ever
8580875 mugabe said the violence came from the mdc but morgan challenged him
8580876 eventually mugabe agreed that they should meet again where morgan could present him with the evidence it was meant to happen the following thursday but it never happened mugabe became unavailable now the old suspicion and antagonism have come back

8580891 parents say they treat their children equally but when you ask people they say of course there was a favourite they take it for granted

8580915 there are people who want to hurt barack obama because of his race
8580916 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16pct less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them
8580917 so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8580918 thats very high because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8580919 patients also need to take their medications exactly as prescribed after an ami statins in particular should only be withdrawn after an ami under close clinical supervision

8580922 who really pays for health care the myth of shared responsibility
8580923 when asked who pays for health care in the united states the usual answer is employers government and individuals most americans believe that employers pay the bulk of workers premiums and that governments pay for medicare medicaid the state childrens health insurance program schip and other programs
8580924 however this is incorrect employers do not bear the cost of employment based insurance workers and households pay for health insurance through lower wages and higher prices moreover government has no source of funds other than taxes or borrowing to pay for health care failure to understand that individuals and households actually foot the entire health care bill perpetuates the idea that people can get great health benefits paid for by someone else it leads to perverse and counterproductive ideas regarding health care reform
8580925 im ok with the free market because im a capitalist
8580926 but you cant have total chaos you cant have health insurance companies playing by their own set of rules playing a cynical game to make us jump through hoops
8580927 one of our biggest challenges as a practice is to make sure we get reimbursed by the insurance companies
8580928 they have a role but its hard not to forget that their main task is to create return on investment to their shareholders
8580929 we physicians carry some responsibility for the fee for service model the more you do the more you get paid but this incentive system is not right
8580930 does the federal government have a role in keeping the population healthy
8580931 children are very cruel and theres a lot of stigma attached to appearance
8580932 this was an unusual case but the parents had been through every other option available
8580933 i dont think bullying victims should be changing their appearance or anything about themselves to please the bullies
8580934 it is the bullies themselves that have got the problem not the victims

8580951 not so much as the throat perspective it pushes us to be a better hospital as it does the other hospitals in serving our community
8580952 is still driven by the physicians working with the nurses and clinical and non clinical staff
8580953 i would say the other hospitals on the seacoast also have some great programs and great technology but thats not where we excel we are all about people how we treat each other and the patients and families who come to see us
8580954 one of the unique and really valuable services this community has is that we run our own ambulance service that goes out for all 911 calls
8580955 its also very efficient for my charge nurse who is the pilot if you will who has to know where the emergency department is going every single minute
8580956 we dont waste time looking for records or x rays
8580957 it now takes a few minutes and we spend more time at our patients side
8580958 before on a saturday night if patient from dr x comes in i wouldnt know what that patients meds are
8580959 but now i can look at their medical records electronically not only does it save me time but i can better look after a patients safety
8580960 its very clear that if you have a procedure that you dont do very frequently because youre a smaller center youre not going to do that as well as a center that does it all the time
8580961 we absolutely want the most sophisticated care possible for our patients but that doesnt necessarily mean providing all of it here in the hospital
8580962 finding the way to best deliver the best services is the right thing to do for us and the community
8580963 we would be lapse in providing the best quality care if we didnt find ways to link with the world renowned centers that are just an hour away
8580964 there are a lot of folks who travel out of new hampshire to massachusetts
8580965 and theres no reason for them to leave their area for radiation care when they can have it here
8580966 ten years ago when we started our cardiac surgery service we brought in very experienced personnel and right out of the box were doing 460 a year
8580967 we met with one of the boston hospitals last year with cardiac care and we knew we needed to be just as good as the large hospitals
8580968 as a by product of portsmouth regional hospital providing cardiac surgery all of the area hospitals were able to grow their programs because we are the back up
8580969 otherwise those patients would have to go to manchester boston or portland
8580970 but over time portsmouth hospital has grown to provide more tertiary care services so residents of the seacoast can stay here to receive services that before they would have to leave the area for as weve grown and added these more difficult programs we are not as reliant on some of the boston programs as we used to be
8580971 but its the leadership dr wharton provides that puts us in top 2 to 3 percent as they say time is heart muscle and the quicker you can get someone into the cath lab the greater likelihood you can save them
8580972 if youre an oncology patient you dont always feel well when you receive those treatments
8580973 its a real convenience to have your treatments close to home
8580974 we have more clinical trials here in oncology and hematologies than the other regional hospitals
8580975 at any given time we have had up to 25 trials going within the oncology department
8580976 we wanted a single standard of care for women being screened for breast cancer
8580977 we wanted to avoid having one level of care here at the hospital and then a different level of care out in the community
8580978 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8580979 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8580980 six years ago smugglers found a few pieces of historical artifacts at an illegal dig here there were mosaics of a stags head among them but no researches have been carried out since then

8580986 its business for them thats all anyone cares about these days
8580987 im not into looking for signs i think well continue to make our case europe the united states and other leaders around the world will make the case to russia that this is a very shortsighted decision on their part
8580988 but they always had holes or were damaged never had we found a whole tomb like this one intact

8581018 although several groups have documented that repeated cocaine exposure increases nac spine density the precise molecular mechanisms that control this process have remained elusive
8581019 moreover the cocaine induced increase in nac spine density has been hypothesized to contribute to the long lasting behavioral sensitization that occurs after repeated cocaine exposure but direct evidence concerning the functional relationship between these two processes is lacking
8581020 taken together our findings implicate mef2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine and suggest that reducing mef2 activity and thereby increasing spine density in the nac may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine
8581021 a better understanding of the mef2 associated molecular mechanisms that regulate cocaine induced structural and behavioral plasticity could ultimately lead to the development of improved treatments for drug addiction

8581027 since i started here insurance premiums have way more than doubled
8581028 if youre a company like ours that really cares for its employees you cant just make a decision on dollar values
8581029 all of the small companies i work with want to contribute more toward their employees benefit premiums but with the cost of health care premiums continuing to go up year over year what they want to do and what they can do financially are in conflict
8581030 i am seeing more and more clients move toward the health savings account which is a high deductible plan which is often less costly than a traditional hmo ppo model the h s a can be an effective product as long as the communication to employees is done well it is a shift in the consumers thinking from the traditional hmo ppo plans and it can be a tough concept for employers and employees to wrap their heads around
8581031 for companies with 50 employees and in new hampshire there are many of these they have little or not way to negotiate the premium costs also because a small company may have fewer participants they are able to participate in fewer options say a long term disability plan for instance
8581032 the carriers often require a minimum 75 percent participation so in a company of 20 employees that is 15 employees because employees wallets are being stretched too im finding they are not participating in as many of the benefits so it becomes a vicious cycle
8581033 employers who can offer additional benefits may not be able to roll them out due to low participation on the part of the employee
8581034 all i can tell you is that weve been part of omnicom for nine years now and its been a great ride for our employees
8581035 beaupre paid 100 percent of everyones health insurance for 24 years until last year we were the final omnicom company to go this route now our people have to chip in a little bit per omnicom but its still a pretty darn good deal considering the rising health care costs
8581036 the single most important thing i have to make clear is the choice we have in november between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for americans and help families who are struggling
8581037 we are issuing the cards to crack down on the behavioural problems we have had in cricket on the gold coast the last few seasons although acceptable there are levels of sledging that are not acceptable like when it gets personal

8581041 now thats done sharif is showing his true colours he resigned from the governing coalition on monday in protest over the treatment of judges fired by musharraf last year
8581042 sharif is in effect setting himself up as a political martyr for democracy the ppp is worried most about the restoration of one judge iftikhar chaudhry
8581043 the most cost effective strategy is to assume a species still exists even if it hasnt been seen for some time
8581044 conservationists should carry on managing the environment as if a seemingly vanished species is still around rather than rushing to check whether it is extinct
8581045 a lot of threatened species are cryptic the question is how do you know how to best protect them
8581046 its really about what do you do for a cryptic species if you havent seen it for a long time
8581047 what was counterintuitive was the length of time you should keep for managing the environment we showed that often you should manage for a lot longer without seeing them
8581048 thus the optimal strategy is to invest in active protection
8581049 if the species remains unobserved for a further 3 years of dedicated surveying the optimal strategy is to stop investing resources in conserving this species

8581069 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas big speech on thursday night will be delivered from an elaborate columned stage resembling a miniature greek temple the stage similar to structures used for rock concerts has been set up at the 50 yard line the midpoint of invesco field the stadium where the denver broncos national football league team plays some 80 000 supporters will see obama appear from between plywood columns painted off white reminiscent of washingtons capitol building or even the white house to accept the partys nomination for president he will stride out to a raised platform to a podium that can be raised from beneath the floor
8581070 consequently independent lines of contact and communication may have been established with some of the major players on the political scene in pakistan by the white house and the office
8581071 its only appropriate that barack obama would descend down from the heavens and spend a little time with us mere mortals when accepting the democratic nomination
8581072 we would have expected to read something like this in the onion fortunately for us its true unfortunately for obama its true
8581073 we knew about it for only a few weeks and had only one week to actually assemble this
8581074 i was watching their hands especially mendis my plan was that if i can read his hand i can play well that was the game plan
8581075 i think i was able to read both murali and mendis well scoring 76 and helping my team win is satisfying
8581076 whenever we are at the nets or batting together he tells me how to plan he is such a class reader of the game he always plays with responsibility we learn a lot from him while batting with him it is good we got partnerships in two matches
8581077 since we lost the final of asia cup in pakistan we were very keen to do well in sri lanka we put up a good show here and won a historic series
8581078 i am getting into a good shape now and thanks to the people who gave me support coach such as robin singh coach gary kirsten venkatesh prasad and others they gave me lots of support hopefully i will remain with the same intensity
8581079 i think i have also improved a lot after playing the ipl i learnt a lot from there my batting is coming on well

8581084 hanno ragione chi ha il compito di fare politica deve intervenire senza delegare ma il mio auspicio perch gli atleti facessero qualcosa di significativo sul tema dei diritti umani era volutamente rivolto a chi ha la fortuna di avere un impatto immediato sui giovani non dimentichiamoci che i grandi movimenti per la tutela dei diritti civili sono sempre nati dalla gente
8581085 senza lentusiasmo che mi ha sempre accompagnato quanto mi mettevo davanti alla tv per guardare le olimpiadi sul podio si festeggiava fuori i fuochi dartificio ma sullo sfondo un grande equivoco adesso arrivato quel tempo delle riflessioni che io avevo sollecitato prima che iniziassero i giochi
8581086 litalia da sempre sensibile a certe tematiche che mettono al centro battaglie per la difesa dellumanit una posizione bipartisan che va oltre al colore di chi governa adesso mi aspetto la stessa forza che la politica ha assunto ad esempio per la campagna contro la pena di morte cosa ci hanno lasciato i giochi di pechino dobbiamo dare risposte immediate altrimenti il grande equivoco delle olimpiadi rester senza soluzione
8581087 e una questione di coscienza io oggi provo una profonda soddisfazione perch senza alcuna presunzione mi fa piacere capire che il mio pensiero ha trovato qualche risposta forse hanno parlato cos perch si tratta di ragazzi arrivati da realt difficili come russo o di atleti non pi giovanissimi e quindi magari pi attenti a certe tematiche i giochi sono finiti adesso la politica faccia quello che non ha fatto prima perch non mi risulta che in cina sia in atto un cambiamento radicale

8581109 notwithstanding recent suggestions concerning possible changes to uk tax laws the directors believe that the most appropriate structure is for the new parent company of henderson group to be tax resident in the republic of ireland
8581110 the uk continues to offer one of the most competitive business tax regimes of any major economy

8581113 a comprehensive scientifically robust and transparent process has been undertaken in the assessment of the potential environmental impacts of this mine expansion and i have given these matters thorough consideration before making my decision
8581114 in making my assessment i have been particularly concerned that the mine does not adversely affect groundwater values
8581115 the current comprehensive monitoring program will continue and heathgate resources will need to clearly demonstrate that they are having no impact on water quality within the great artesian basin or on aquifers outside the mining lease
8581116 essentially the company has been allowed to expand the area that it is able to do that three or fourfold
8581117 it is incredibly disappointing to see peter garrett of all people allowing such a thing to take place given the current state of water in australia and in south australia in particular
8581118 it should be completely unacceptable in this day and age

8581142 the face of politics has changed dramatically throughout this election and emerging media technologies have clearly taken center stage
8581143 the outburst forum at the dnc gave us a chance to showcase wiffitis capabilities for sparking intense debates that extend far beyond the venue itself the forum panelists did an amazing job at propelling the digital conversation forward while still giving the audience control of the dialogue its so rewarding for us to see wiffiti used in this way

8581152 this was a very challenging acquisition project in terms of the timeline and topography not to mention our need to minimize the operational footprint in a sensitive area that includes wildlife numerous ranches and access restrictions to public lands in addition we needed to acquire densely sampled full wave data to better characterize a fractured shale reservoir that east resources plans to re develop ive seen some of the early traces and the seismic data look to be of the highest quality we couldnt have completed this project without firefly matching a game changing technology with an experienced contractor provided a unique solution to the operational and imaging challenges we faced on this project
8581153 firefly represents a new approach to land seismic acquisition after some initial training for our field personnel in how to operate using the different technologies and workflows associated with firefly our crews became very comfortable with the system and productivity increased accordingly this was among the more challenging seismic surveys weve undertaken and our ability to complete the project within the specified timeline was enhanced by our use of a cableless system such as firefly
8581154 we learned a lot from the initial firefly field trials for bp and apache in late 2006 and early 2007 the insights we obtained were incorporated into version 2 0 of the firefly system which from all accounts performed up to our high expectations and those of our clients i am delighted that east resources will have the data they require to optimize reservoir development and believe both they and other e amp p companies that license the data will see what the ion family of companies is able to deliver when called to execute challenging imaging projects like this one i also want to thank both green river energy and especially geokinetics for all of their efforts and helpful feedback throughout the project all of the seismic contractors we invited to bid on the acquisition portion of the project save one told us that they simply couldnt get it done in the time allotted with conventional cable based acquisition technology geokinetics stepped up to the challenge leveraged the firefly system and delivered

8581157 as weve indicated before it is our belief that most of the significant delays are behind us and we are confident about the companys growth
8581158 we still believe that 2008 will be a turning point for oti in terms of showing a clear path to profitability and will reflect revenue growth of about 10 over 2007 with most of the growth expected in the fourth quarter of the year

8581165 fiscal 2008 marked a major transition in ecds history as the company generated positive operating cash flow of 28 5 million during the year a significant improvement from the negative 21 8 million in fiscal 2007 we also completed an important capital raise that will allow us to fund our expansion to 1gw of capacity by the end of fiscal 2012 the selection of uni solar to power the worlds largest rooftop solar installation validates our continued success at selling differentiated value proposition into new and expanding markets and distribution channels in the rooftop and building integrated pv markets i am confident that our growth and momentum will continue into fiscal 2009 and beyond
8581166 we are pleased to report a very strong start to our fiscal year 2009
8581167 these results are a testament that ata has a proven and solid growth platform to take full advantage of chinas fast growing test and test related sectors looking forward we expect ata to continue to benefit from the high barriers to entry we have built over the years and from very positive trends in our industry as the pace of new computerized test offerings as well as the conversion of existing paper based tests accelerate in the quarters and years ahead we hope to win new large testing contracts leveraging our strong track record and unique capabilities in delivering nationwide computer based tests in a cost effective and secure manner and we expect our growth to continue to be resilient to economic factors such as the volatility in chinas securities market the sichuan earthquake in may 2008 and the 2008 olympics to reach new milestones we are very excited about the outlook for our business and see a long runway ahead in our market

8581215 tengo esa espina clavada llegu al valencia en un gran momento de forma con t tulos bajo el brazo era internacional con brasil hab a sido campe n del mundo y pens que podr a aportar muchas cosas a este equipo pero las lesiones provocan que la gente se olvide de todo eso y que se creen dudas
8581216 todo esto me duele porque yo s lo que puede hacer me siento muy bien y espero tener la posibilidad de jugar varios partidos seguidos ese es mi reto para esta temporada
8581217 me parece muy bien el esfuerzo que ha realizado el club con estos dos jugadores ya que como ellos hay pocos aportan muchas cosas goles y calidad y son los que marcan la diferencia
8581218 no soy yo quien ha de decidir sobre este tipo de cosas hay gente en el club que responder a mejor a esta pregunta
8581219 fue un palo duro pero hay que olvidar cuanto antes y empezar a vivir la liga

8581234 its actually causing greater environmental impact over a larger area
8581235 it is incredibly disappointing to see peter garrett of all people allowing such a thing to take place given the current state of water in australia and in south australia in particular senator ludlam said
8581236 it should be completely unacceptable in this day and age
8581237 i am satisfied that the tough conditions attached to this approval will ensure the highest standards of environmental management by the mine operator mr garrett said
8581238 my decision demonstrates the governments commitment to ensuring worlds best practice environmental standards for uranium mining in this country

8581275 i certainly know theyve died in the hospital and sitting in the back of the ambulance car has contributed to that mr dutton said today
8581276 theres numerous cases we can talk about where people have been revived from cardiac arrest who have had to wait outside the hospital for up to an hour before they can actually be seen in the hospital
8581277 ramped outside emergency wards but he said the situation would only get worse
8581278 the community of queensland needs to realise this is not the ambulance drivers fault its queensland healths fault
8581279 thats fantastic thats a great effort but theyre not going to be any good if we cant get them to the jobs get them away from the hospitals
8581280 we provide a very professional standard of care but obviously thats limited to what were trained to do
8581281 these people need to go to the next level thats why we have doctors and nurses to extend the level of care
8581282 thats the other side of ramping while its uncomfortable and inconvenient for people sitting in the ambulance its absolutely risking their health and wellbeing by not receiving the level of care they deserve
8581283 theyre the ones receiving the triple 0 phone calls and theyre the ones who then have to make a decision where theyre going to get an ambulance from
8581284 in some ways communications staff are the unsung heroes of this whole process
8581285 very bad and the situation was becoming worse at brisbanes hospitals
8581286 close tight knit group was hoping to go back tomorrow and use the memory of priestley to get through it she said
8581287 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy the spokeswoman said
8581288 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married the spokeswoman said
8581289 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8581290 no one loved her doing it more than mark he was thrilled she said
8581291 the cast have been rocked by two tragedies the seven spokeswoman said
8581292 he could be quite a handful at times but he had the most extraordinary combination of very deft comedic touch and great emotional depth said howard who plays dr frank campion
8581293 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him he said
8581294 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8581295 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends

8581311 the building is crescent shaped intentionally so that the neighboring buildings dont really get a view into the units
8581312 we dont have any buildings behind us either there are only low rise residential communities so really theres no access to look into a unit from another building

8581324 nel calcio le insidie possono nascondersi ovunque ha spiegato il tecnico partenopeo alla vigilia del ritorno al san paolo sarebbe sciocco vedere ostacoli insormontabili dopo una vittoria per 3 0 ma ci tengo a vedere massimo impegno da parte di tutti non dobbiamo rischiare di complicarci la vita perci chi gioca deve dare il massimo

8581350 the goal of the video games defense is to both shift blame and to explain to a judge and jury why this good kid is suddenly acting like a terrorist
8581351 portraying your client as the victim of outside forces be they child abuse coercion by peers or an ultra violent video game industry humanizes the client and shifts the culpability
8581352 really wanted to capture the heart and soul of detroit
8581353 were still in a situation of wait and see when it comes to buying co products as there hasnt been a big enough drop in price of products such as trafford gold bread and stock feed potatoes to warrant buying them on forward contracts
8581354 soya and rape meal are also reasonably priced so some producers are buying those on forward contracts as insurance but the price still needs to fall a little
8581355 some co products have moved off the favourable list such as liquid feeds due to storage options and feeding difficulty but some remain a viable option such as bread but at 10 12 t it still needs to fall a bit more there certainly isnt the panic that was surrounding winter feed options this time last year
8581356 the last two seasons have confirmed the fact livestock producers need to operate flexible systems to cope with feed changes as and when market process force them to do so so the biggest issue here is forage analysis to know exactly what products you require
8581357 the cost of minerals will never go down so producers need to know they are feeding the right mineral depending on farm status and the right amount to each animal to justify the cost
8581358 the clinic will allow farmers to get a free ration and if on forage based systems producers must bring in an analysis so we know what the silage represents allowing a more balanced accurate diet to be drawn up
8581359 it is important farmers actually understand what feeds do and how they work for example energy puts on condition and fat rather than growth
8581360 too often producers feed an excess of one nutrient and not enough of another and so essentially money is wasted but by having an accurate ration made up and sticking to it producers can seek out the most appropriate feed for the cheapest price
8581361 to get the most out of the one to one session farmers will need to spare about 20 30 minutes so time can be taken to go through to relative values working out the type of feeds that will work best on individual farms
8581362 every farm requires an individual ration as different finishing systems and breed variations all affect what needs to be fed this is great opportunity for farmers to take advantage of this free service and to start thinking what and how to feed finishing cattle this winter bearing in mind costs and forage quality
8581363 i am getting very concerned about the rape drilling we are 10 days behind at least and i would like to get it in over the next four or five days
8581364 the game could have been over inside 20 minutes it could have been a far heavier defeat if wed taken a few of the chances we missed and we hit the post three or four times
8581365 man for man there wasnt a disappointment on the park i was delighted scoring goals is a very important thing for me and scoring eight goals in any game regardless of the standard of opposition is good going
8581366 on the whole it was nice and sharp football and they made plenty of chances
8581367 i didnt change much from the formation in the first game and the boys played well then i dont understand why we lost to them and i felt they deserved another chance and they proved that they can do it
8581368 it was an important win although the standard of opposition wasnt very high i think theyve been ravaged by players leaving and financial difficulties but at the time we didnt know that the boys did very well and did all that was asked of them
8581369 a few of them maybe felt like theyd been let down but once they found out it was a personal thing they felt it was understandable
8581370 hes resigned but his contracts not been taken away so i felt i was in a position where i could bridge a small gap
8581371 i wouldnt have applied for the job myself but in the circumstances i looked around about and saw a good bunch of boys and a manager that was having a wee bit of a difficulty at the time and thought i could maybe help out for a short time to see if it might remedy itself
8581372 i offered my services and they took it and decided to see how it would go for a short period of time paul had put together a good bunch of boys and i wasnt going into it with a hard job to do i just had to keep them together and focused
8581373 people were congratulating me after saturday but i said it was all down to the players it wouldnt have been easy for them to get over and they responded very well now theyve set a benchmark and have to try to meet that every week
8581374 i havent seen them but i imagine theyll be a lot better than peebles its another game we start all over again
8581375 the 8 2 is done and dusted it was nice and they enjoyed the whole game and played some nice football but thats three points in the bag and this saturday we start again
8581376 i heard a comment that dalbeattie do ok at home but the away form isnt so great so well have to try to remedy that and pick up all three points on saturday
8581377 its perfectly normal changing bodies growing up sex and sexual health
8581378 there were pot seeds around and i would pick them up my mum thought it was funny if i ate them
8581379 it was challenging i grew up real fast i saw things i might not normally see
8581380 theres a lot of uncertainty but at the moment its largely based on concern rather than facts if we have lost crops in yorkshire and the south west it will put more pressure on prices but it is still a bit too early to call
8581381 but its a very regional picture germinations need checking and theres also a lot of fusarium about so growers need to be very cautious about saving their own seed
8581382 the base price for wheat is still fairly stable so seed prices dont seem to be affected yet at about 350 370 t delivered its more a question of physically getting hold of the product
8581383 theres plenty of seed available but the speed of turning around varieties with the right dressing could be an issue if theres a big rush in the next week or so
8581384 i was hearing a lot of reports of sprouting in oxbridge so i abandoned the rape to cut it
8581385 ground conditions are wet were making a terrible mess but ive seen it worse
8581386 we havent rolled since last friday weve just had low cloud and no sun
8581387 the past three weeks have been trying to say the least
8581388 therefore be careful how you walk not as unwise men but as wise making the most of your time
8581389 whatsoever you do do it heartily as unto the lord and not unto men
8581390 now this i say he who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly and he who sows bountifully shall also reap bountifully
8581391 i think this shows a shift in the way south africans are thinking
8581392 people are focusing much more on the here and now and want to fear something they can control its very oprah
8581393 there is nothing worse than having to untie your shoe in the middle of the day to get a tiny stone or a piece of lint out
8581394 then when you put your shoe back on the laces are much tighter than the one on the other foot so the rest of your day is disrupted
8581395 but in the end you know you can never win and you eventually have to stop sometimes in the middle of a busy street or a shopping mall and take your shoe off
8581396 the thing thats in there often turns out to be so much smaller than you think sometimes you turn your shoe upside down and you dont even see the piece falling out its so tiny you have to listen for it landing onto the floor to be sure
8581397 the goal is not to collect more data its about extracting insight from this data
8581398 the whole focus of the bill was to protect taxpayers and i would hope the local taxing districts would also be interested in protecting taxpayers

8581402 after much soul searching i made a conscious decision to stop waiting for that mythical dream home and begin implementing the many ideas i had been collecting for so long to my surprise i found that instead of being a hindrance the limits of my time talent funds and location actually generated artful solutions that i would never have dared to try or even thought of otherwise
8581403 we know the monsoon comes every year why werent they ready for the disaster the fact is that there was much less flow in the river than the stated capacity which exposes the kind of maintenance that was done
8581404 unfortunate lobby consisting of politicians bureaucrats builders and engineers who take money and dont do any work there is no oversight of this process thats why we get flooding every year
8581405 during our flood response last year we found that the levels of children trafficked from the state increased in large numbers two of the affected districts arraria and katiyar according to our study have the highest instance of child trafficking the current disaster will increase levels of poverty and desperation and create a favourable environment for traffickers

8581424 is to build partnerships with our customers and todays lunch was a platform to express our need to work together and to create sound business plans from which both parties can win

8581428 the terms of reference given were to establish whether or not any criminal offences were identified and had been committed by any persons involved in this project the financial crimes unit have examined a large number of documents financial transactions and accounting records
8581429 a full report together with documents and other records was submitted to the legal department in cayman these papers have now been fully reviewed by the independent senior queens counsel
8581430 at the time of the financing deal mr david berry was a business associate in mr bushs real estate company we also know that mr bush was chairman of the turtle farm we also know that mr suresh prasad was a close acquaintance of mr bush and that both mr berry and mr prasad were representing gc ventures in this deal
8581431 referred to documents which make reference to the relationship between mr mckeeva bush and messrs berry and prasad

8581435 dan duguay is wrong and the report was wrong he made outlandish statements and i simply do not believe that he understood
8581436 were not in dispute i have never been given any indication that we had even one fact wrong in the report
8581437 i still stand by my wanton disregard statement we paid nearly 1 million for advice that was not much advice at all i believe there was the potential for criminal activity but whether there was or not is not my place to decide that is why we handed it to the police and they did not find any evidence
8581438 im very happy to hear that i think its time for the country to stop the speculation and get this thing moving again
8581439 an excellent opportunity to network with colleagues from around the region with the hope of facilitating future exhibitions and collaboration

8581441 according to the faa federal aviation administration a near midair collision is defined as an incident associated with the operation of an aircraft in which a possibility of collision occurs as a result of proximity less than 500 feet to another aircraft i e 500 feet absolute distance or a report is received from a pilot or a flight crew member stating that a collision hazard existed between two or more aircraft the incident did not meet this criterion
8581442 now that the ntsb has concluded its investigation i feel it appropriate to publicly comment on the incident i am pleased the official report is supportive of cayman airways and the actions of our crew
8581443 the pilots and staff at cal have provided professional service to these islands for 40 years and safety remains their top priority i am happy that this matter is now closed
8581444 it was the ugliest go around they had seen in 24 years on the job
8581445 what cayman has taught me is that once you stop wanting everything you dont really need anything
8581446 all persons are reminded that they should check their travel documents now to ensure that they are in order
8581447 it is my duty to prevent you from going this way
8581448 victory has not truly been won until the victor acknowledges it

8581451 the death of the blue iguanas at the park affected everyone on these islands including my son who previously sponsored one of the iguanas from the park

8581462 through a combination of the current and largest to date westtel five a side football league the new co ed five a side programme set to begin in weeks and with the fall hockey programmes we will see close to 1000 competitors demonstrating their skills at kings
8581463 the prior leagues had fantastic season finales the westtel youth hockey league saw 100 players strong involved with the kpmg senators taking the 10u title
8581464 the 6u and girls programs will also further integrate into more league play the alba high rollers will try to defend their cherry cup title in september when the new league kicks off
8581465 in the football sector century 21 will try for a three peat championship in division one while the largest d2 programme tries to battle it out for their trophy co ed should also be a big hit as the south coast sharks look to take another co ed five a side title
8581466 the philosophy of sports at kings is that change is inevitable we look to keep up with the growing number of athletes by continuing to renovate programmes to allow for further player enjoyment
8581467 in youth hockey we are splitting off age brackets to allow for more players to participate while offering more conducive age guidelines in the beginner skate programme a huge focus is being pushed for new players to join
8581468 on the football note by reducing the amount of competitiveness in the league were hoping to foster the growth of adult players both women and men this new arena of play will allow for long term growth as novice players feel more comfortable on the pitch
8581469 there are several major events to keep an eye on in the fall playoffs playoffs playoffs before december well see the crowning of a number of teams throughout the array of our sports definitely look out for the headlines as our competitors both young and old vie for their top marks
8581470 it was great to meet kids from all over the world and to learn new football techniques the coaches were great it was amazing to actually see the premiership and champions league trophies and go to old trafford
8581471 manchester uniteds camp was a great international football experience for me meeting people from all over the world and being exposed to such a high level of coaching and playing has given me a broader perspective of the quality of football outside of cayman
8581472 it was a great experience for me i learnt a lot more about football i particularly enjoyed the skills challenge when we participated in scrimmage games to get challenge points with the player obtaining the most points being invited to old trafford to participate in a world skills challenge before a premiership game
8581473 i was impressed with the coaching and the quality of the training sessions it gave me a good feel of what the life of a professional footballer is like and it was a dream come true to go to old trafford

8581491 embed human rights in the nhs constitution and put them at the heart of its plans for reform of health and social care regulation
8581492 failing to meet basic rights is not acceptable no one should have to go without help with eating and drinking or using the toilet yet this is still happening every day in hospitals and care homes its horrendous that people are still being mistreated and abused
8581493 human rights are not visible enough in government policy and are even more difficult to see in practice despite the excellent care provided by many health and care workers there is much work to be done to change the culture of health and social care
8581494 without a commitment from policy makers and staff to uphold peoples human rights we cannot be confident our loved ones will be treated with dignity or respect
8581495 we are doing everything in our power to protect vulnerable older people and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect in all care settings no one especially not elderly people should have to put up with abuse or ill treatment
8581496 earlier this year we amended the health and social care bill so that any independent sector care home that provides accommodation together with nursing or personal care on behalf of a local authority is subject to the human rights act
8581497 this is only part of a wide ranging package of measures being put in place we are also extending our first ever dignity in care campaign creating the first ever national dementia strategy and reviewing the no secrets guidance on protecting older people from abuse

8581511 tarung penyair panggung yang digelar pemerintah kota tanjungpinang ini patut diapresiasi dengan baik ini sebuah momentum bagaimana pemerintah menghargai para penyair dan penyair pun ditantang untuk terus memberikan pemikiran bagi kemajuan kota tanjungpinang khususnya bidang seni budaya
8581512 sehingga tak dapat dipungkiri apabila suatu daerah tidak memiliki penyair dan tidak menghasilkan kesusastraan dalam kerangka kebudayaan yang bernilai maka kecenderungan daerah tersebut terperosok dalam peradaban hitam korupsi merajalela kemaksiatan bertahta suara hati tak terdengar lagi kota atau daerah jadi hilir mudik ketakutan tak ada kepastian hukum masyarakat bagai hidup di belantara kesewenangan

8581531 unfortunately the state of israel cancelled your performance in the country due to lack of budget and because several politicians in the knesset had believed at the time that your performance might corrupt the minds of the israeli youth
8581532 a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform

8581537 so i took leave hanging up my arms in the cathedral church where there were many i had done the like already in the chapel at finisterre
8581538 the cape of finisterre is two miles high surrounded and beaten upon by the sea there are the footmarks footsteps of buddha in ceylon of our lord s james and a well that he made himself with his own hands there is one in the hillside above padr n and one just before you get to santiago besides also a sort of chair in which sat s peter and s james and s john

8581549 i had not been told about that but i am led to believe its still at the exploratory stage
8581550 i am not concerned about that we have an agreed set up with guiding principles which we have rolled out and which have been signed off
8581551 with the exceptions of two weekends the international players will be available for every game which will increase intensity and interest in the competition
8581552 magners league teams and players also enjoyed success in other competitions last season the six nations champions heineken cup and anglo welsh cup winners are from amongst our ranks whilst the representation of capped players in magners league games is higher than other european leagues
8581553 this is the ideal time for those players to make their mark
8581554 celtic rugby is always striving to align itself with other professional rugby tournaments around the world consequently this season will be the last that the magners league is played in its present format
8581555 from 2009 10 we will be introducing an end of season play off to determine the magners league champions with the top four teams qualifying for the knockout stage
8581556 it will maintain interest in the league through to the end of the year without relegation there is not a lot of jeopardy but i believe the play offs will fix that
8581557 i am sure the closeness of our league will ensure teams in fifth and sixth place are challenging for play off places and confident it will improve the competitiveness of it
8581558 we also intend to address the irregular nature of the competition by creating a rhythmic season achievable as magners league weekends will not compete with any other tournament
8581559 we would like to see it happening in september 2009
8581560 this is something that should be seen as very exciting and dynamic for welsh rugby
8581561 i was introduced to him by a friend who was raising money for him and the friends name was dr khalid al mansour from texas he is the principle adviser to one of the worlds richest men he told me about obama he wrote to me about him and his introduction was there is a young man that has applied to harvard and i know that you have a few friends left there becasue you used to go up there to speak would you please write a letter in support of him i wrote a letter in support of him to my friends at harvard saying ot them i thought there was a genius that was going to be available and i sure hoped they would treat him kindly

8581573 initially i would have said i was quite firmly against the new laws
8581574 after playing with them the majority of them make a slight alteration and dont make a huge difference
8581575 theres a couple that dont change the way we play but the difference isnt as marked as i thought it would be
8581576 should they have brought the rules in no the guinness premiership and heineken cup are great brands of rugby
8581577 i know there are problems elsewhere in the sport but why change what weve got when its doing so well
8581578 the way the game is going were heading to a more super 14 type of rugby
8581579 but its pointless moaning about them weve spent the summer developing skills that allow us to make best use of them
8581580 now ive accepted them and played under them ive started to see the positives about them

8581612 he went round the outside and someone walked with him to verify what he did
8581613 i couldnt walk the whole way as it was too far for me but i kept him in sight all the time and did some of it with him
8581614 i think it was nearly four miles in the end but we couldnt be completely sure because the pedometer wasnt working
8581615 it took him about an hour he was walking quite fast and running at times but he still said he wanted the play football afterwards
8581616 he said he would love to do it again im very proud of him he did very well
8581617 at the end i gave him a big hug and treated him to a few sweets
8581618 i had a zip to my pockets and they couldnt get them undone so they obviously thought it would be easier to take my jogging bottoms luckily i had some shorts on underneath and it didnt happen that far from my house

8581625 i have put a lot of work into the pond with a pergola over the top steps up to it decking around it there are wind chimes its something i have created for the whole family
8581626 i sit and watch the fish and find it very relaxing lots of people know we have the pond i just cant understand what the problem is i am disabled and find it very relaxing
8581627 the sound of water for a disabled person is very relaxing i just cannot understand who would complain about such a thing
8581628 i am not aware of this particular case but people have got to follow proper procedures for developments there needs to be a degree of control otherwise it would be a free for all
8581629 this should have been applied for properly but i am sure people not against the pond as such we need to check that it is appropriate for the area and fits in with its neighbours suffolk homes

8581637 s ending deceptive signals and leading competitors away from a preferred female can be a powerful alternate mating strategy providing relief from sperm competition in highly dynamic mating systems like that seen in poeciliid fishes
8581638 deception appears to have evolved as a counter strategy in a system with a high potential for male mate choice copying

8581691 the royal navy does not tolerate misuse of drugs by its personnel and internal action is underway against all 18 individuals
8581692 notwithstanding the numbers involved in this single unprecedented incident which is being treated very seriously it has not affected the ships ability to do its job
8581693 the worst aspect of this scandal is that hms liverpool is supposed to be guarding the falkland islands and such a large drugs bust hardly does wonders for confidence
8581694 these results must be understood in context tests show that drug misuse is almost 20 times more common in civilian workplaces than it is in the navy positive test rates in the navy last year averaged less than 0 4 compared with over 7 in civilian workplaces
8581695 the uk ministry of defence conducts europes largest compulsory drug testing programme and this has significantly reduced drug misuse among service personnel

8581699 his case could have been properly dealt with by our own prosecuting authorities instead we believe that the british government declined to prosecute him to enable the us government to make an example of him
8581700 american officials involved in this case have stated that they want to see him fry the consequences he faces if extradited are both disproportionate and intolerable and we will be making an immediate application to the european court to prevent his removal

8581924 lula da silva defiende que las riquezas del brasil son de todos y deben repartirse de forma solidaria
8581925 indudablemente brasil ha sabido utilizar el agua para generar energ a limpia y renovable es un referente en la lucha para preservar el medio ambiente y lo m s importante lucha por ser un pa s donde predomine las solidaridad la igualdad y la justicia tres palabras claves que deber a tener en cuenta nuestro presidente del gobierno rodr guez zapatero

8581970 we didnt anticipate such a big response from the market from the customers
8581971 the olpc had several effects in terms of pricepoint it slashed the market open for that type of device
8581972 it also had people talking about the emerging markets but actually in reality in the western world what it talked about was cheaper pcs
8581973 the whole concept whilst 100 was not feasible certainly blew the market open and started people talking about this and really it was one of the catalysts for the whole eee pc platform style thing to take off
8581974 it was a very very bold statement which unfortunately hasnt come to pass as predicted but it did make a lot of people go back and look at the education market and they thought well perhaps there is something here we cant hit 100 but well try and well make it say 300 or 200 and all the arguments for there being computers in classrooms are true even in countries that are relatively well off
8581975 so that was where the asus came for the education market that wasnt being addressed properly the olpc demonstrated that
8581976 the asus eee came from a different engineering idea marketwise it was very similar
8581977 we have a smaller screen we run less memory we get the costs out of the system any way we can

8581993 to the best of our knowledge the outcome of the probe if at all it has been concluded has not been made public
8581994 indeed the yaradua administration by hurrying to sign a fresh deal with siemens when the company has not been cleared of the bribery charges against it has turned the german engineering firm into a sacred cow undermined his own administrations anti corruption battle and made nigeria a laughing stock
8581995 the action has also shown that the government does not mean what it says which is a big blow to its credibility in the eyes of the citizens and non citizens alike
8581996 if it is true as reported by the media that the anti corruption agencies were not consulted before the siemenss deal was signed then the yaradua administration has a lot of explanations to make the party said
8581997 recall that in a statement on nov 18th 2007 we ac had warned if ever any government has a chance to show its anti corruption campaign is not a fluke it is this yaradua government considering the rate at which the corruption allegations are being made against public officials in both the past and present administrations

8582025 technology does more in 10 years and less in 2 years than we think its going to
8582026 were only at the beginning of two of the most profound social and economic trends of our age globalization and digitalization
8582027 laws of increasing returns in the new economy driven by a networked world
8582028 the value of a network increases exponentially as its users increase arithmetically
8582029 the more who use social networks the more attractive networks become
8582030 if a product or a company or a technology one of many competing in a market gets ahead by chance or clever strategy increasing returns can magnify this advantage and the product or company can go on to lock in the market
8582031 the archetypal case of a success explosion in a network economy is the internet itself as any proud old time nethead will be happy to explain the internet was a lonely but thrilling cultural backwater for two decades before it showed up on the media radar a graph of the number of internet hosts worldwide starting in the 1970s stays barely above the bottom line until around 1991 when the global tally of hosts suddenly mushroomed exponentially acting upward to take over the world

8582035 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8582036 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8582037 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8582038 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8582039 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8582040 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8582041 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8582042 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8582043 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8582063 i wouldnt like to say the word compete at all
8582064 theyre not going to be identical but the key difference we have is that we do target all hardware thats in the market and work closely with all the hardware vendors so it depends what your application is and whether thats important to you
8582065 were already past the teraflop and thats a huge amount of horsepower there that you can take advantage of not just for rendering but for other things too were extending the direct3d api in order to take advantage of the gpu for other usages we have added the compute shader so you can start to create more complicated data structures than simply 2d textures
8582066 will further increase the use of mobile devices and add an element of fun in the mobile usage for each person willing to play in the location gaming field
8582067 we see a huge potential for location oriented entertainment and gaming in mobile phones
8582068 by giving access to our 3rd party apis to the game developer community we believe that we can help these developers save a substantial amount of time when creating location based or alternate reality games especially on the mapping search and positioning side

8582102 kita harapkan market share yang hilang di 2005 kembali lagi
8582103 kita mesti lihat pada waktu itu apakah waktu itu kebayang harga minyak naik sampai 100 dolar tidak pernah terbayang kan kita sudah tanya analis tanya opec mereka bilang rata rata harga minyak 10 20 dolar
8582104 waktu tangguh biayanya diputuskan biayanya juga murah bayangkan saja british petroleum berani investasi rp 55 triliun kalau itu proyek rugi mana dia mau
8582105 penalti tidak ada perubahan sudah mereka setujui mereka setuju pada 3 4 dolar sekarang kita minta lagi dengan perubahan kedua dengan wapres kemarin sudah ada goodwill
8582106 kita salah satunya memang akan melakukan sistem distribusi tertutup supaya mirip minyak tanah dengan kartu kendali tapi itu masih dalam wacana ya kita belum bikin mekanismenya
8582107 kita lihat apa konsumennya yang dituju benar benar kenayang harus dibagi sekian kiloliter minyak tanah apakah itu tercapai targetnya itu kita verifikasi semuanya oleh pemerintah nanti jika ada something wrong ada yang tidak biasa maka kita akan konsultasi dengan pertamina
8582108 kita akan memilih tim nama nama tim terlalu banyak tapi yang paling penting kriterianya yang disebutkan presiden punya integritas dan tidak punya conflict of interest kita pikir berdasarkan cv reputasi pengalaman mereka
8582109 we regret that we missed the opportunity to tell matthew mitchams story we apologize for this unintentional omission
8582110 nobody from the county board or from any of the clubs has been in touch with me
8582111 all know about the situation is what i have been reading in the papers but i normally attend the monthly meeting of the county board and i will definitely be going along on next monday night
8582112 its going to be up to celtic and norwich but im enjoying my time here
8582113 at the end of the day celtic isnt where everything stops
8582114 you have to look at yourself and if its not going to be there you have to move on and get your career back on track

8582122 we are hoping for a draw that will get us into the group stages
8582123 we would take on anyone but we will be up against it if we get one of the bigger clubs
8582124 the dream for me would be a draw that gives us a chance and then we get tottenham hamburg and ac milan in the group stages i would like to think the fact i played 10 years for aberdeen hamburg and celtic in europe would help us as a club

8582128 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case
8582129 although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role
8582130 as the worlds last great wilderness areas disappear under pressure from human impact to have a continent with this much remaining wilderness intact is unusual and globally significant
8582131 six years ago smugglers found a few pieces of historical artifacts at an illegal dig here there were mosaics of a stags head among them but no researches have been carried out since then
8582132 we believe that there is an ancient roman city hidden beneath the soil
8582133 yellowstone is located atop of one of the few large volcanic hotspots on earth
8582134 but though the hot material is a volcanic plume its cooler than others of its kind such as one in hawaii
8582135 although yellowstone sits above a plume of hot material coming up from deep with the earth its a remarkably lukewarm plume
8582136 the most cost effective strategy is to assume a species still exists even if it hasnt been seen for some time
8582137 conservationists should carry on managing the environment as if a seemingly vanished species is still around rather than rushing to check whether it is extinct
8582138 a lot of threatened species are cryptic the question is how do you know how to best protect them
8582139 its really about what do you do for a cryptic species if you havent seen it for a long time
8582140 what was counterintuitive was the length of time you should keep for managing the environment we showed that often you should manage for a lot longer without seeing them
8582141 thus the optimal strategy is to invest in active protection
8582142 its a very exciting find because you rarely come across the bones in their original skeletal shape
8582143 we have found vertebrae ribs and a thigh bone of a very big adult dinosaur from the early cretaceous period
8582144 its also enormous we first found a femur thigh bone 1 80m long articulated with the hip then bigger and bigger ribs up to 2 40m
8582145 those from the early cretaceous period are much less common and one of this size is vary rare so we are able to advance our knowledge of the group in this period

8582149 the evolution of the cerebral cortex certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and culture and to respond to pain ssociated with social interactions
8582150 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to elive re experience and suffer from social pain
8582151 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
8582152 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
8582153 many of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after pregnancy improving overall health for women and their families
8582154 una apuesta exclusiva por la soluci n militar no tiene perspectivas la nica manera de dar una soluci n universal a los problemas existentes es considerar a pleno los intereses de todas las partes e implicar a ellas en el proceso negociador en vez aislarlos

8582163 fue una decisi n muy dif cil el reconocimiento de las rep blicas que se adopt teniendo en cuenta sus consecuencias y tras un an lisis sobrio de la situaci n a partir de la historia de los pueblos osetas y abjasos su aspiraci n a ser independientes los tr gicos acontecimientos ocurridos las ltimas semanas y los precedentes internacionales relacionados con el reconocimiento de nuevos estados
8582164 nuestras tropas entraron en el territorio de georgia para destruir las bases desde las cuales se realiz la agresi n contra osetia del sur y despu s nos retiramos nosotros logramos restablecer la paz pero no pudimos extinguir el temor y las aspiraciones de los pueblos de osetia del sur y abjasia en situaciones cuando saakashvili con el apoyo de estados unidos y pa ses de la otan continu hablando sobre el restablecimiento del poder b lico del ej rcito georgiano y de acciones para restablecer el control en todo el territorio georgiano
8582165 algunos de esos gobiernos resultaron incompetentes al momento de establecer sus relaciones con las minor as tnicas y georgia inmediatamente anul a osetia del sur y abjasia la autonom a que hab an disfrutado en calidad de rep blicas aut nomas en el seno de la georgia sovi tica
8582166 ellos occidente optaron por proteger al presidente mijail saakashvili cuyo primer paso fue despojar la autonom a a la regi n de adzharia otra rep blica aut noma en el seno de georgia y nunca ocult su prop sito de aplastar a los surosetas y los abjasos
8582167 en las relaciones internacionales usted no puede tener unas reglas para unos y normas diferentes para el resto
8582168 en la noche del 7 y la madrugada del 8 de agosto supimos la raz n s lo un demente pudo emprender un paso de semejantes magnitudes acaso crey saakashvili que rusia permanecer a al margen mientras el ordenaba una agresi n contra la ciudad dormida de tsjinvali asesinando centenares de civiles indefensos muchos de ellos ciudadanos rusos supuso que es rusia permanecer a de brazos cruzados mientras las tropas de paz georgianas abrieron fuego contra sus colegas rusos cuya misi n conjunta era evitar la violencia en osetia del sur

8582185 we need to talk to russia and to discuss the issue of splinter regions from georgia
8582186 we need to discuss the whole architecture of states around russias western and southern border to avoid committing nato to maintain borders we cannot in practise enforce at an acceptable military cost and to allay russian fears to make russian military action less likely
8582187 we need to see how big the disagreements are and to assess if any other state apart from georgia is in danger of a russian invasion so far the west has not won over enough independent world opinion to strengthen its hand in negotiation with russia
8582188 we need some strategy rather than more foreign policy spin

8582195 surely this is not a work of art but a blashphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that upsets many people

8582201 as far as were concerned the matter is settled and were moving on
8582202 due to the seriousness of the issues raised the commission should contact the proper authorities so that investigations into these issues may be performed
8582203 we felt the best thing we could do for our members was to seek full recovery and thats what we accomplished
8582204 i think his speech was directed at other australian states and not at victoria john brumby said in melbourne
8582205 much further down that track than any of the other states
8582206 weve put in place a whole series of systems which provides comparative information on performance data and so on to parents mr carpenter said
8582207 for too long i think the federal government has walked away from those schools that are doing the toughest job out there she said
8582208 we want transparency and we are prepared to bring new and extra resources to the table to make a difference to disadvantaged schools and to make a difference on teacher quality she told abc radio
8582209 mr rudd has the power now to withhold money from states that have not complied with this and the challenge for him is will he do so
8582210 its punitive its saying principals perform or heads will roll she said
8582211 everyone is worried about inflation again people were hoping that inflation will moderate and interest rates have probably peaked but i dont think thats going to happen now
8582212 the negative sentiment will prevail as there is no liquidity in the market and the macro economic indicators are not showing signs of any improvement
8582213 essentially going back to the birth of mr coleman until now
8582214 it was determined he meets the clinical and statutory definition of mental retardation
8582215 they did their own testing and reached a conclusion consistent with what we contended they did the right thing when the facts became known
8582216 we did what we felt was right we went to the court and asked to set aside the death penalty
8582217 its a shame that it has taken 28 years to get to this point but no one could have anticipated the supreme court ruling that came 22 years later
8582218 im going to shoot you if its loaded too bad if not youll be ok
8582219 whatever a persons view on the death penalty i dont think anyone would dispute that it needs to be administered in fair way

8582226 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8582227 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8582228 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8582229 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8582230 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8582231 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8582232 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8582233 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8582234 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8582235 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8582236 the bottom line is this theyve responded to high inflation by australian historical standards the highest inflation in 16 years which is what we inherited last year
8582237 and what were seeing is the washthrough of 10 interest rate rises in a row under the liberals
8582238 our practical plan is to see the economy through in the long term and that means making some tough decisions to do that
8582239 we are urging the public not to confront him to pick up the phone call 911 and be a good witness
8582240 i handed him his change and he said i want the rest of it and i yelled at him youve got to be kidding me and i slammed the register shut
8582241 i said you stupid idiot and he ran out the door he didnt get anything
8582242 i tell them we can get a robber anytime and the only thing they can do is to cooperate with him
8582243 its going to be very exciting but its also going to be nerve wracking because you know he has a big task ahead
8582244 as an african american i am proud to see obama come as far as hes come i will be very proud
8582245 man when i see him speak the kind of feeling i get its like watching the olympics and watching a black man running for his goal
8582246 im so proud of him and of how far hes come and hes got a good chance too
8582247 i dont care whether hes black white or pink i care about his politics and i dont particularly care for obamas
8582248 i think it is something to be proud of because its never happened before and black people are not well appreciated
8582249 the people i speak with in egypt one part of their mind says the united states is a den of iniquity they hear about rodney king they hear about katrina they hear about the housing crisis and they think only white men can succeed in the united states
8582250 but literally at the same time they know that the united states is the most fair and just country on the planet even given all that
8582251 and so even the nomination of barack obama forget if he wins or not has changed the playing field a bit they take this as an excellent example that not all is wrong with the united states
8582252 his theme has been change and i hope in his speech hell be able to tell us how hell accomplish this change
8582253 african americans always face this stereotype that they are ignorant or that they cant have that kind of power
8582254 it will inspire a lot of people especially young black men and women they should realize what is possible
8582255 with this happening its making me want to vote for the first time and im 20
8582256 it has been a burst of inspiration because he also is someone that many people like me who are first generation or mixed race can relate to
8582257 to see someone like that on tv its something that weve never experienced before for kids or for adults like me who are of mixed race
8582258 it touches you directly because its very on the surface but also at the same time its someone in the higher echelons of power
8582259 its a momentous occasion for someone of color to get that far without being murdered
8582260 im 70 years old and its hard to get me fired up with hope
8582261 i have been disappointed time and time again over my lifetime in looking for some hope in terms of solutions to the problems that not only certain groups but the whole country face
8582262 alors que dans un pass r cent des doutes s taient manifest s quant la possibilit de la belgique datteindre 10 millions dhabitants il appara t aujourdhui quelle se dirige lentement mais s rement vers 11 millions dhabitants
8582263 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8582264 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out i cannot set the precise time or deadline
8582265 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention center
8582266 if the police want to arrest them come here and do so or if they want our leaders to give themselves up that is fine but the government has to resign first
8582267 the whole broadband process has become a shambolic tendering fiasco
8582268 its something thats so confusing and causing such concern in the broadband and telecommunications community that were seeing investment frozen
8582269 this is from an outfit that claimed the election of the rudd government would turn australia from a flintstones era into a jetsons era overnight when neither of those claims are true
8582270 were seeing broken promises racked up on broadband and no improvement in service availability
8582271 we have embarked on such a significant national project here involving potentially billions of dollars of public funds

8582308 entre le milieu des ann es 1970 et les ann es 2000 le changement climatique a t responsable denviron 150 000 morts suppl mentaires par an il touche de mani re crasante les populations les plus pauvres selon nos estimations les chiffres devraient cro tre et encore nous ne prenons en compte quune partie des causes de morts dus au changement climatique ce nest que la partie immerg e de liceberg

8582346 it is incredibly disappointing to see peter garrett of all people allowing such a thing to take place given the current state of water in australia and in south australia in particular senator ludlam said
8582347 it should be completely unacceptable in this day and age
8582348 i am satisfied that the tough conditions attached to this approval will ensure the highest standards of environmental management by the mine operator mr garrett said
8582349 my decision demonstrates the governments commitment to ensuring worlds best practice environmental standards for uranium mining in this country

8582364 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships

8582374 we expect that the current price correction in the used car market has some way to go although we anticipate that it will have run its course by the end of the year
8582375 we have seen unexpected and significant downward movements in wholesale prices for used cars in june through to august due to falling retailer and consumer confidence in the uk
8582376 we continue to believe like most commentators that trading conditions in the uk will continue to be difficult for the remainder of this year and throughout 2009
8582377 the full effect of the actions we have taken on cost reductions will come through in 2009 when we should see improvements in margins and profitability subject to no further significant downturn in our markets

8582442 that was one of the things that i remember him doing
8582443 it didnt deter him at all he still went out and flew

8582445 putting his experience in words and creating something that people might enjoy reading was something he enjoyed doing

8582453 ramping a term used for when patients have to wait in ambulances outside the hospital when there are no free beds
8582454 i certainly know theyve died in the hospital and sitting in the back of the ambulance car has contributed to that mr dutton said today
8582455 theres numerous cases we can talk about where people have been revived from cardiac arrest who have had to wait outside the hospital for up to an hour before they can actually be seen in the hospital
8582456 ramped outside emergency wards but he said the situation would only get worse
8582457 the community of queensland needs to realise this is not the ambulance drivers fault its queensland healths fault
8582458 thats fantastic thats a great effort but theyre not going to be any good if we cant get them to the jobs get them away from the hospitals
8582459 we provide a very professional standard of care but obviously thats limited to what were trained to do
8582460 these people need to go to the next level thats why we have doctors and nurses to extend the level of care
8582461 thats the other side of ramping while its uncomfortable and inconvenient for people sitting in the ambulance its absolutely risking their health and wellbeing by not receiving the level of care they deserve
8582462 theyre the ones receiving the triple 0 phone calls and theyre the ones who then have to make a decision where theyre going to get an ambulance from
8582463 in some ways communications staff are the unsung heroes of this whole process
8582464 very bad and the situation was becoming worse at brisbanes hospitals
8582465 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8582466 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8582467 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8582468 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8582469 ultimately it gets down to self acceptance if you accept yourself you dont give a damn what anyone else thinks

8582480 it was our first game so they were very sharp and it took us by surprise i think
8582481 it was very difficult to go there the fans were behind them and they treated it as their cup final they were very strong in their man for man marking
8582482 we did not play our best but we got a good result hopefully well perform better at home
8582483 i think its fantastic i like the traditional kits i think we should wear kits that represent the history of the club and this one certainly does that
8582484 i think you will think about that night and that team when you wear this kit particularly with the embroidery of the date around the badge the fans will love it
8582485 when you look at the final image you will associate it with the great team of 1968 with the likes of george best and bobby charlton
8582486 obviously they won the european cup in blue so we hope we can walk in their shoes again with this kit its such a big part of the history of the club
8582487 its a nice kit its been designed to celebrate 40 years since the european cup win so its great to have a kit that remembers that team
8582488 when you come to a club like united the history of the club is something that is important for new players to understand its different to go out in blue but its all part of the clubs history and i think thats important
8582489 right at the time oil prices are skyrocketing were struggling with the economy were concerned about global warming and national security threats remain intense we wake up and weve got this abundance of natural gas around us
8582490 imagine if tomorrow you could announce a new energy plan that would in one stroke cut your constituents gasoline bill in half reduce oil imports improve our air quality enhance national security strengthen the dollar reduce greenhouse gas emission and create tens of thousands of new jobs in the u s
8582491 theres a possibility that under our feet are the same kind of shale gas deposits that you have in the united states
8582492 there are many of the same types of shale formations in europe
8582493 the europeans have to hope that these shales will do for them what eastern shales have done for the u s gas supply which is to boost the main supply that is coming from the gulf of mexico
8582494 that would reduce the prices the russians were able to charge the final consumers in europe
8582495 shale is the most significant domestic natural gas find in 50 years

8582500 you make me love paris even more than i already do
8582501 im reading this post at my office on a floor of open work cubicles laughing hysterically
8582502 i want to tell you how much i enjoyed the podcast you should be a radio announcer
8582503 in other words it will help voters to think like democrats
8582504 in many situations the abortion issue alone has elected a member of congress in the house or the us senate
8582505 shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges
8582506 policies on the economy taxes health care and energy are far superior to the republican alternatives
8582507 i look at this sort of like a family business i wanted the stories to challenge the family and how they deal with one another
8582508 i was so exhausted at that moment i was breathing hard and i didnt have the energy to get up
8582509 i would have loved to you know take a nap on court because i was really exhausted
8582510 but you know the rules are the rules i had to keep going
8582511 its going to be good in two days im sure after that happened i was thinking more of it than i was really actually feeling the pain so its not really a big deal
8582512 but in that certain moment i felt big pain so i just had to tape the ankle
8582513 the moment we got onto the court 23 000 people stood up some moments in your life you cant forget that was kind of a turning point in my career
8582514 i started believing after the finals that i really can win
8582515 i knew it was a matter of time i just needed to work and really dedicate myself to it so thats what i did and it paid off
8582516 i didnt play quite as well as i did the other day
8582517 i didnt find my rhythm but sometimes you just have to get through these matches
8582518 embed human rights in the nhs constitution and put them at the heart of its plans for reform of health and social care regulation
8582519 failing to meet basic rights is not acceptable no one should have to go without help with eating and drinking or using the toilet yet this is still happening every day in hospitals and care homes its horrendous that people are still being mistreated and abused
8582520 human rights are not visible enough in government policy and are even more difficult to see in practice despite the excellent care provided by many health and care workers there is much work to be done to change the culture of health and social care
8582521 without a commitment from policy makers and staff to uphold peoples human rights we cannot be confident our loved ones will be treated with dignity or respect
8582522 we are doing everything in our power to protect vulnerable older people and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect in all care settings no one especially not elderly people should have to put up with abuse or ill treatment
8582523 earlier this year we amended the health and social care bill so that any independent sector care home that provides accommodation together with nursing or personal care on behalf of a local authority is subject to the human rights act
8582524 this is only part of a wide ranging package of measures being put in place we are also extending our first ever dignity in care campaign creating the first ever national dementia strategy and reviewing the no secrets guidance on protecting older people from abuse
8582525 the offences for which our clients extradition is sought were committed on british soil and we maintain that any prosecution of our client ought therefore to be carried out by the appropriate british authorities
8582526 our client now faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
8582527 pozostawienie w nocy na pastwisku z dala od siedzib ludzkich niestrze onego wartego kilka tysi cy z otych byd a podobne jest do zostawienia w rodku nocy w centrum miasta otwartego samochodu z kluczykami w stacyjce to swoiste zaproszenie dla z odzieja
8582528 im so thankful that my midwife and doctor paid such wonderful attention to me and the little ladies
8582529 and i m really glad that i got to 36 weeks with multiples
8582530 the bush presidencys fealty to big oil is now making for strange bedfellows
8582531 blocking my site is a move by a desperate government that is trying to silence me but its not going to stop me
8582532 it only reveals that the government does not know how to handle the internet
8582533 everyone is subject to the law even web sites and blogs
8582534 if it can happen to raja petra it can also happen to other bloggers
8582535 in a democracy we dont have to agree with each other but we must defend the right of everyone to speak up including raja petra and other voices of dissent
8582536 intend to curtail peoples freedom or right to express themselves
8582537 this has been a summer that many retailers would rather forget the downturn in the housing market is continuing to depress sales for those shops selling big ticket items

8582558 this data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time
8582559 these systems tend to produce false positives flagging up innocent people as suspicious
8582560 combining two different sources of data has the tendency to increase your false positive rate or your false negative rate
8582561 if youre looking for burglars in a run down district where 50 per cent of men have a criminal conviction you may find plenty but if youre trying to find terrorists among airline passengers where they are extremely rare then almost all your hits will be false
8582562 currently there are no good patterns available to recognise terrorists
8582563 now in 2008 these very characteristics are presented as value added selling points in the company advertisement of its product
8582564 the efficiency and reliability of such tools is as yet unknown
8582565 more surveillance does not necessarily lead to a higher level of societal security hence there must be a thorough examination of whether the resulting massive constraints on human rights are proportionate and justified
8582566 we implement stringent safeguards to prevent misuse of such systems for unauthorised purposes in all countries where we operate we do business strictly according to the nokia siemens networks standard code of conduct and un and eu export regulations
8582567 in many cases politicians policy makers and human rights organisations lack the technical expertise to adequately assess the impact that such technology could have when it is exported to repressive regimes
8582568 this years election is one of the most critical in our history
8582569 ladies and gentlemen its time for some straight talk this election wont make any difference im not even voting and im running for president
8582570 i recently was fortunate to meet with pres hamid karzai in afghanistan he couldnt pay his staffs salaries he couldnt even pay to keep the lights on no he didnt have much money he barely had enough to survive but when he came out on stage and he was ready to play people came alive

8582573 thank you please thank you okay please stop thank you please no i mean it ill walk off this stage enough okay fine i accept your nomination
8582574 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in my eight years working around the globe i first learned in kindergarten
8582575 in his first important decision as the nominee he hit it out of the park
8582576 well i dont want to say all our history because technically james polk was more of a squanderer than bush wouldnt want to leave the wrong impression there
8582577 only millard fillmore was more of a squanderer than bush
8582578 ladies and gentlemen barack obamas uncle is here tonight please join me in saluting whats that speaker off mic no im not talking about emil jones

8582583 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8582584 i am just going to denver to provide some balance to whats going on there on behalf of my candidate senator mccain
8582585 hes on vacation ive been told thats all im allowed to say hes on vacation
8582586 ill even go one step further with you than ive gone with other reporters
8582587 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8582588 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8582589 in scena ogni artefatto digitale ha un suo ruolo in una sceneggiatura aperta che attende il nostro contributo
8582590 appartiene allordine dellimmagine sia essa mentale verbale inscritta in una tela o realizzata sul territorio
8582591 as we experience this world through ourselves yet still humbleness has its place in our lives i can feel confident and be myself on the one side but at the same time take others as better and greater
8582592 be joyful always pray continually give thanks in all circumstances for this is gods will for you in christ jesus
8582593 i hate both germany and iphone apps leipzig diary day three
8582594 i personally dont have the attention economy to read a 250 page crime novel from start to finish i realized that the way id like to consume a novel is to be rewarded every couple of chapters by seeing something visual that enhances the narrative
8582595 harry diamond s problematic if not explicitly threatening figure is ingeniously and incongruously coupled with one of the most memorable potted plants in the history of art set in the most solid of plant pots not quite hallucinatory but enhanced to a disturbing degree man and pot are both standing on an unforgettable painted carpet and only in the view from the window with the waif on the pavement below is the curious still tension perhaps necessarily dissipated
8582596 bowery posing as a huge insouciant lord of misrule lounges provocatively on his unworthily neat little throne and seems to be questioning the artist about his conduct of the whole enterprise while freud refuses to be daunted by his not entirely mock imperious sitter
8582597 so layered that photographs cant get near it his portraits are among the best around
8582598 i paint what i see not what you want me to see
8582599 oh hey mars 1 i didnt even notice his paintings anywhere but i dont like his art that much holy shit does that say jeff fucking soto does that say jeff soto is that is he aah
8582600 shit these people seem really enthralled about this artist and now they are holding a piece of his merchandise
8582601 some artist you like was showing there werent they it was like jeff soto or something
8582602 life can be really shitty but sometimes it will throw you a live jeff soto painting
8582603 a prepaid credit card offers a simple effective and safe way of paying you top up the card with money and then use it to pay for goods safe in the knowledge that you can never go overdrawn or into debt
8582604 people are increasingly worried their banking details might fall into the wrong hands when they purchase online and with good reason optimum allows people to enjoy all benefits of shopping online without having to fear of fraudsters accessing their banking details
8582605 parents looking for a way to educate their children to be responsible with their money find that prepaid cards provide an excellent teaching method because they give the child the chance to be independent and even purchase goods online but there is a strict budget in place this can be handy for everyday life or perhaps if a child is going on a school trip where they need cash
8582606 we should no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men by the cunning craftiness by which they lie in wait to deceive
8582607 another thing that hinders receiving the holy spirit or anointing is people pray all the time
8582608 a woman who has a husband who does not believe if he is willing to live with her let her not divorce him
8582609 even entertain the thought that you might get a counterfeit
8582610 from among yourselves men will rise up speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after themselves
8582611 go pray for sarah your friend im going to heal her
8582612 that girl totally incapacitated paralyzed and blind after two and a half hours of soaking prayer got up seeing
8582613 savage wolves will come in among you not sparing the flock
8582614 if youre going to be concerned about deception then please be concerned about the greatest deception that there is and the greatest deception of all in my opinion is not to fall for teachings of a false prophet in my opinion the greatest deception of all is to have a move of god come through and you not recognize it
8582615 woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing
8582616 take the sword if you have any secret sin because that sword may turn on you
8582617 sword of the lord warrior anointing the sword of the spirit is the word of god ephesians 6 17 without the side effects of falling down and moving ones arms back and forth
8582618 surely this is not a work of art but a blashphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that upsets many people
8582619 wounds the religious sentiments of so many people who see in the cross the symbol of gods love
8582620 art must always be free and the artist should not have any restrictions on freedom of expression
8582621 constantly check yourself and get help immediately if you find that something is wrong do not depend on your own will but look to god for strength finding favour in him rather than men
8582622 and i got to meet the president of the united states again
8582623 the vigor with which countrywide chased v i p s was matched only by the aggressiveness with which it marketed loans to risky borrowers
8582624 it was not unusual for us to get a call saying a bills being introduced
8582625 though weymouth has no journalism experience the newsroom chatter about her has been positive so far in part because she seems down to earth and decisive at a time when morale is low and apprehensiveness is high
8582626 sam zell may be a loon with tourettes syndrome but hes not crazy
8582627 one is obviously intellectual caliber the ability to run our newsroom and identify good stories two is charisma and leadership and the third is the ability to think strategically about the newsroom of the 21st century
8582628 amsterdam has become the leader of a full throated campaign to free khodorkovsky russias most famous and richest prisoner in part amsterdam has become a soviet style propagandist
8582629 osteen hasnt necessarily tailored his message for the downturn instead he has continued his feel good preaching his reminders that god wants you to have a good job a beautiful home and a decent cash flow
8582630 the accessibility of my message doesnt bother me a bit i think the success of the message in the marketplace is because we are optimistic encouraging
8582631 the ease with which facebook can be used to broadcast your whereabouts adds a particularly disturbing dimension for executives who would surround themselves with security in real life but are lulled into complacency by facebooks tidy veneer

8582643 the voters wanted medical marijuana dispensaries to be used for seriously ill patients and their caregivers not as million dollar businesses

8582674 the research clearly highlights the importance of online interaction between consumers when faced with purchasing decisions whether it is with blogs comparison sites or user reviews brands need to understand and engage with social media to survive the expected economic downturn
8582675 it is clear from this research that online strategies will have to become far more sophisticated to weather the economic slowdown a one size fits all strategy will no longer be the most effective and online retailers will have to start to segment their audience and match their marketing activity to each group

8582682 her personality doesnt indicate that she would be so creative to make such tales
8582683 there are people gifted with imagination but surely she isnt amongst them
8582684 id like to share some details pertaining an object that was accompanying me in my way home at night from 7th to 8th august 2007
8582685 i dont like visits at a gas stations with her
8582686 everytime when she approach the cash registers it breaks down i remember similar occurrences taking place about 6 times
8582687 when i was driving my car on the right side in not build up area between katowice and sosnowiec driving a narrowed part of road due to roadwork i noticed some light peering out from the gaps between cloud layer that was moving in strange manner it was already positioned quite low but still above the clouds i wasnt scared but rather intrigued with it at that time i even called my co worker saying that i saw something strange
8582688 suddenly i noticed that it keeps tracking me and at that moment i feel scared i realized that it is not any terrestrial craft but something extraordinary i also realized that it is pursuing me i was so scared because i was alone on the road although there were probably few cars but in the distance that i didnt turned the road i usually drive home but the other one
8582689 when i reached the estate i saw that the object is still in the air as it waiting for me
8582690 the craft also could trace my car from above i had an impression that since the moment when i saw it for the first time and began to gaze this thing began interested in me as well and therefore it began pacing me it looked as if this energy was intelligent
8582691 i decided to look up and saw a bright blue oval object hovering in the clouds above me it was quite large and rotating i was both scared and fascinated with this sight
8582692 it looked as some king of energy rotating around it axis i couldnt notice neither metallic structure of the craft nor anything resembling terrestrial things known to me
8582693 i can compare it to stars at first they emerged quickly out of the object and then began to fall down it seemed that they descend toward the blocks but the most surely to the nearby meadows it was hard from my point to trace the flight path of objects that became more and more brighter while descending therefore i fled away they surely werent meteorites those orbs as well as the bright object remained completely silent
8582694 another seeing of a movie in which she plays the main role
8582695 at that nigh i fled to the center and lost the ufo from sight i began calling to my old friend and he wake up i wanted to hid somewhere and drive to him he is a witness of my behavior just after the sighting he states that he has never seen me such frightened he believed that something must really happen i ordered him to close the window then i approached it to check if they are still somewhere at first he thought that im raving and he didnt know how to react then he realized that he had never seen me before acting in similar way and that indeed i saw something extraordinary
8582696 two days later after the first encounter i was on the balcony of my apartment the cloud layer was dense but im sure that i have seen the same thing i perceived bluish light very high in the air then i went in and close window
8582697 on the second occasion i took my mother to the balcony but the object was barely seen anyway i showed it to my mum and she affirmed that she could see it but she completely doesnt believe in such phenomena and she stated that i saw a satellite or weather phenomenon
8582698 man are you sure itll be hard to get out of here

8582724 ive spent over 600 this past week for all the tickets i just bought and the traveling i have to do
8582725 especially as newcomers its really important to have the internet where people can talk about you and listen to your music
8582726 the fans outside of germany send us e mails they come together and shoot a video or something and they say please come to wherever israel whereever
8582727 it was always our dream to travel the world and play in big cities and
8582728 we got 80 to 120 e mails we got so many phone calls you have no idea we thought they were unknown here
8582729 we have so much inspiration its everywhere so i always have a pen with me and a laptop and i write everything down
8582730 we think we have no chance but its just great being nominated
8582731 the fans voted so much for us its a great feeling
8582732 its really a big deal for a german band to have the chance to go to the u s
8582733 i dont really want them to get really famous here
8582734 getting big also brings about the question of them losing sight of their german culture
8582735 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8582736 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8582737 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8582738 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8582739 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8582740 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8582741 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8582742 i only used state aircraft for state business the plane picked me up and took me to places where i was conducting state business and only when my schedule did not allow for car travel

8582744 odot pilots informed us that it is not uncommon for passengers who have never been listed on the manifest to show up at the airport ready to fly just prior to takeoff
8582745 what is significant to us is this issue that our crews on the ground need to know whos in the air and heaven forbid something would happen to one of our planes and we not know whos on board
8582746 we have already put those policies into place to make sure before a pilot takes off our ground crews know whos on board and whos not on board
8582747 in our view it is long past time for odot officials to unambiguously express that flight logs are in fact official records which must be maintained accurately
8582748 this came out of left field last week when they told the girls and us parents about the change our jaws just hit the ground
8582749 weve spent more than 400 on the uniform and she worked hard and earned the right to wear her uniform at school
8582750 i dont have any doubt that the republicans are gunning for that seat in 2010 in large part because of the seat on the apportionment board
8582751 it doesnt necessarily mean that all of their complaints are unjustified
8582752 we are eliminating all of the excuses she is making why does she want to prevent people from getting access to absentee ballots
8582753 while we appreciate the gesture most of our printing orders have already been submitted
8582754 its appalling that house speaker husted has attempted a possible go around on secretary brunner calling on boards of elections to ignore her directive regarding an unclear underfunded legislative mandate
8582755 secretary brunner has acted in good faith to make the best of what we were handed by the general assembly
8582756 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8582757 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8582758 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8582759 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8582760 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night

8582772 its a good weekend to plan to spend with the family and enjoy the treasure of dillon state park muskingum county is fortunate to have a state park its a great event to wrap up the summer
8582773 its a fun thing that takes little gas and is easy on mom and dads wallets
8582774 theres no charge for the event and the things we are charging for are at minimal cost with everybody getting squeezed by gas and grocery prices its nice to do something without spending a huge amount of money
8582775 we may not be 100 percent well but were alive
8582776 until the army corps of engineers addresses the situation downtown is still vulnerable
8582777 theres great things happening people just dont realize it yet
8582778 some of those stores that were downtown were just barely making it and the flood gave them a reason to not come back
8582779 but they will be filled up in time with businesses that do fit the current mold

8582891 open source is an interesting way to share knowledge but 93 or 94 percent of the computers in the world run microsoft software
8582892 in a very beautiful room in the capital and everyone needs to follow their decision
8582893 i believe in the power of local people to decide what kind of software they will use
8582894 there are examples of open software which have been quite successful
8582895 in other areas we still rely on proprietary software if we have alternatives that prove themselves to be quite equivalent we give preference to open software model because that would allow for future developments that would allow for future betterment of the software
8582896 the idea is not to make a business out of that but more like a social franchise
8582897 its interesting this idea of providing a local solution for a local problem

8582932 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8582933 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8582934 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8582935 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8582961 you know ive cleverly inserted myself in the roll of the governors speakers
8582962 this speech is different i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives and so in that sense i think this is going to be a more workmanlike speech im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric
8582963 hes going to lay out the case for change hes going to set the stakes of this election the risks of continuing down the road were on which is plainly what senator mccain is offering
8582964 obama keeps talking about change but any change is a gamble
8582965 it means stepping into the unknown and if the argument is being made by somebody whos not that well known theres even more apprehension about the unknown
8582966 the american people want a democratic president theyre just not sure they want this democrat
8582967 three quarters of the electorate is still going to be white
8582968 hes doing pretty well among them but that only puts him neck and neck with mccain he needs to do better

8582995 januvia boosts the effect of a natural body process called the incretin system
8582996 incretins are intestinal hormones which are released after food intake and they are essential for regulating blood glucose
8582997 research has shown that people with type two diabetes have an impaired incretin system so their body is unable to lower blood glucose effectively
8582998 this is the first time we have been able to address an impaired incretin system using an oral medication
8582999 by increasing the number of intact incretins in the body januvia helps to control on demand the high blood glucose levels that may contribute to serious long term health problems such as heart attack stroke kidney failure blindness nerve damage and amputation

8583003 when you had the opportunity to participate in the biggest economic reform you simply would not accept that challenge for five minutes of political advantage
8583004 governments only get one opportunity to sell a public asset and if they decide to sell its essential that taxpayers get the best possible price
8583005 thats not possible given the current uncertainty in the energy sector
8583006 the parliament was going to reject electricity privatisation if it was given the chance
8583007 the governments adjournment means this bill will now lapse and will not be dealt with and for the workers and consumers that now means electricity privatisation is now dead in nsw

8583039 they are quite frankly not on the forefront of change your vice presidential candidate must compliment the ticket few people vote for a presidential candidate because of the v p but its more likely for someone to vote against the president because of their v p thats why mccain has to be very strategic with this

8583055 wir haben alles untersucht was wir uns vorgenommen hatten als wir mit opportunity in den krater hinabgestiegen sind und noch vieles mehr

8583057 wir wollen sie nun detaillierter untersuchen eine auswertung der analyse von mehreren steinen kann uns wichtige informationen ber die geologie dieser region liefern

8583064 this is not a question of whats true whats right whats wrong
8583065 the issue is those military judgments should not be second guessed
8583066 their hands were on that water pump and it should have been grounded
8583067 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8583068 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8583069 military ships are hardly a common way to deliver such aid

8583074 matznetter hat heute in einer pressekonferenz ein sp ma nahmenpaket gefordert und vorgestellt was die sp denn alles zu tun gedenkt ich stelle hier die frage was hat matznetter bisher f r die menschen getan au er alle belastungen seines finanzministers brav mitgetragen sozusagen eine komplette arbeitsverweigerung des staatssekret rs und jetzt eine versuchte w hlert uschung deshalb fordere ich im namen der steuerzahler matznetter auf seine ber 300 000 euro gehalt zur ckzuzahlen denn wer nichts arbeitet der hat auch nichts verdient
8583075 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8583076 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8583077 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8583078 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits

8583087 we view illegal immigrants as one of many possible security threats to our installations and respond accordingly
8583088 it is critical to ices homeland security mission to know who enters sensitive areas like airports military bases and power plants to ensure the integrity of these key assets
8583089 in virginia we have been kind of the model for successfully prosecuting illegal immigrants
8583090 we are very aggressive when it comes to protecting the installation
8583091 we put that out clearly that fort lee will not be tolerating illegal immigrants working on post
8583092 it is a big deal from the standpoint that we have to stop work
8583093 unfortunately you have an individual who is hired to do work who is not aware of where the work is being done they dont know that identification will be checked
8583094 virginias construction industry is dependent on a large force of immigrants both documented and undocumented
8583095 the crime here is that congress has failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform
8583096 its sad its tough but unfortunately weve got a job to do we need to protect this installation
8583097 we realize that when you are breaking the law you are breaking the law and we are not at all going to play favorites to anyone
8583098 ohne eine sp bildungsministerin g be es in der bildungs und schulpolitik wenig zu jubeln und schon gar nicht k nnte man sich ber wichtige und zukunftsgerichtete verbesserungen wie die senkung der klassensch lerh chstzahlen oder die erprobung neuer schulmodelle freuen w hrend bei ministerin schmid der fortschritt im vordergrund steht waren es bei vp gehrer blockade und r ckschritte unter gehrer wurden in den vergangenen jahren beispielsweise 5 500 lehrerinnen abgebaut und stunden sowie freigegenst nde gek rzt
8583099 und ebenso sollte man die kirche im dorf lassen nicht das land finanziert die senkung der klassensch lerh chstzahlen und die zus tzlichen lehrerinnen sondern wir bekommen die kosten zu rund 90 vom bund refundiert ebenso haben wir bei einem anteil von 22 bei der tagesbetreuung im vergleich zu anderen bundesl ndern noch einen geh rigen nachholbedarf wobei auch hier der bund kosten der lehrerinnen im ausma von 5 stunden bernimmt so vermissen in nieder sterreich rund 6 000 eltern f r ihre kinder ein tagesbetreuungsangebot im n pflichtschulwesen sind im besten fall 450 pl tze im heurigen schuljahr dazugekommen die vp sollte sich also nicht mit fremden federn schm cken sie sollte lieber daran arbeiten defizite der vergangenen jahre endlich aufzuholen
8583100 plassniks bedauern erfordert auch distanzierung von der bisherigen vp ortstafelpolitik
8583101 die vp hat seit dem ersten vfgh erkenntnis zu zweisprachigen ortstafeln in jahr 2001 keinen einzigen verfassungskonformen l sungsvorschlag eingebracht seit damals hat gerade die vp mit sch ssel die meiste zeit den kanzler gestellt und als eine l sung m glich war die von allen ma geblichen partnern getragen wurde war es wiederum gerade die vp die dagegen war
8583102 und jetzt bedingt vizekanzler molterer eine l sung auch noch mit dem einverst ndnis von lh haider
8583103 nun ist offenbar sp staatssekret r matznetter als n chster an der reihe um von den segnungen des faymannschen entlastungspaketes zu berichten
8583104 hier handelt es sich um den blichen theaterdonner der nun in der sp zelebriert wird um zu kaschieren dass man sich eineinhalb jahre von der volkspartei hat vorf hren lassen
8583105 das land vorarlberg ist das erste bundesland das die seit jahresbeginn vom seniorenbund erhobene forderung auf erh hung der heizkostenzusch sse auf 250 euro zur g nze umsetzt das freut mich sehr und ist f r mich ein weiteres klares zeichen dass nur die verantwortungsvolle arbeit der vp den menschen wirklich hilft
8583106 am 28 september werden die sterreicherinnen und sterreicher eine richtungsentscheidung treffen sie haben die wahl
8583107 auf der einen seite steht die vp die mit sorgsamer und verantwortungsvoller arbeit f r die menschen und mit ihrer kompetenz im wirtschafts und sozialbereich eine politik bietet die sozial treffsicher ist und gleichzeitig die f r alle steuerzahler in sterreich so wichtige steuerreform nicht gef hrdet auf der anderen seite steht eine sp die mit ma losen sozial absolut nicht treffsicheren und gro teils nicht umsetzbaren forderungen nicht nur eine steuerreform f r familien und mittelstand sondern generell den standort sterreich und die zukunft der generationen in sterreich gef hrdet
8583108 die menschen sehen ja selbst wer versprechen h lt und wer antworten auf die fragen hat w hrend vorarlberg heute mit bestem beispiel vorangeht weigert sich das sp gef hrte wien nach wie vor die heizkostenzusch sse anzuheben obwohl sie dort bei l cherlichen 100 euro liegen
8583109 sie k nnen zwischen wilhelm molterer einem sachkundigen staatsmann mit handschlagqualit t der h lt was er verspricht und einem werner faymann einem aalglatten machtpolitiker auf den einfach kein verlass ist w hlen der vergleich macht sie sicher
8583110 leider sind die neuinfektionen bei hiv wieder im steigen begriffen
8583111 und dann war alles anders leben mit hiv und aids
8583112 die hohe diskriminierung jener die eine infektion haben m ssen wir senken
8583113 einerseits herrscht nicht zuletzt durch die gro en medizinischen fortschritte der letzten jahre eine gewisse sorglosigkeit andererseits herrschen aber immer noch massive vorurteile die auch eine soziale ausgrenzung von infizierten und erkrankten bedeuten aufkl rung und pr vention sind daher das gebot der stunde
8583114 und dann war alles anders leben mit hiv und aids
8583115 wir t ten uns schon leichter wenn wir zwei oder drei mal so gro w ren
8583116 ich bin grunds tzlich daf r dass rechtzeitig nachgedacht wird was die n chsten schritte sein m ssen das haben wir bei der aua gelernt
8583117 es geht nicht um ideologie sondern darum was sinnvoll ist f r das unternehmen unseren standort und die hier besch ftigten mitarbeiter
8583118 das sichert die zukunft des unternehmens und der arbeitspl tze ein starker partner ist eine option wenn das management das f r notwendig erachtet
8583119 daher war es vollkommen unverst ndlich dass die vp in den letzten tagen werner faymanns 5 punkte programm in bausch und bogen abgelehnt hat aber immerhin ist zumindest in dieser frage bei der vp wieder vernunft eingekehrt
8583120 der hartn ckigkeit der sp ist es zu verdanken dass dann doch noch eine einigung im ministerrat f r die rasche erh hung erfolgt ist
8583121 dass die vp in den letzten tagen dann pl tzlich wieder dagegen war und heute wieder daf r ist l sst auf eine gewisse unzuverl ssigkeit der volkspartei schlie en ich hoffe das ja der volkspartei h lt bis zur abstimmung im parlament
8583122 ab 1 september sollen innerhalb der eu einheitliche grenzwerte gelten diese eu harmonisierung der pestizid h chstwerte ist das endg ltige todesurteil f r den feinkostladen sterreich und gef hrdet mensch und boden br ssel w rzt in zukunft unser essen mit pflanzenschutzmitteln
8583123 zwischen erlaubter h chstmenge und gesundheitsgef hrdung besteht zum teil kaum mehr eine differenz
8583124 verst rkt wird die gefahr dadurch da sich auf obst und gem se ohnehin mehrere pestizide finden k nftig auch in deutlich h heren konzentrationen
8583125 das gro e interesse und der derzeit wieder stark steigende aktienkurs zeigen deutlich dass in der aua unternehmenssubstanz als auch strategisch noch viel m glich ist die iag ist aufgefordert mit aller sorgfalt die angebote zu pr fen um das beste f r die rund 6 700 aua mitarbeiter die airline und den wirtschaftsstandort sterreich zu erreichen
8583126 mit dem regen interesse seitens m glicher investoren steigt nun auch das image der in letzter zeit zu unrecht angekratzten fluglinie wieder in ihrem ansehen f r die aua und den standort bietet das eine gro e chance
8583127 um glaubw rdig zu sein erwarte ich mir dass die bewertung von unabh ngigen keiner fluglinie nahestehenden experten durchgef hrt wird
8583128 wer sich auf die fp verl sst ist schon verlassen
8583129 tatsache ist dass die frist f r die abgabe einer stellungnahme vor einem monat abgelaufen ist wien hat zeitgerecht gehandelt und eine stellungnahme abgegeben die an kologischen grunds tzen orientiert ist wien hat dabei auch wesentliche verbesserungen f r die wienerinnen eingefordert
8583130 denn die jetzige fp stellungnahme ist reine makulatur so gro kann das engagement der fp f r dieses thema also gar nicht sein
8583131 es beweist sich einmal mehr dass die sp den richtigen weg geht n mlich die anliegen der menschen ernst zu nehmen und sich laufend f r verbesserungen und entlastungen einzusetzen das z hlt jedenfalls mehr als billiger aktionismus
8583132 marktwirtschaft braucht die lust auf neues offenheit f r fremdes ebenso werden wir das wohl erfolgreichste modell der wirtschaftsgeschichte nur gemeinsam auf europ ischer ebene erfolgreich weiterentwickeln k nnen
8583133 antrieb f r aktivit t und finden der besten l sungen
8583134 ein bereich in dem es in sterreich in der tagespolitik sp rbare gegentendenzen gibt
8583135 wenn jemand glaubt dass dies keine auswirkungen auf unsere sozialsysteme hat dann ist das eine gef hrliche selbstt uschung
8583136 sterreich hat sich von einem land mit viel zu wenig markt und einem zu gro en staatlichen einfluss auf die wirtschaft zu einer im internationalen wettbewerb erfolgreichen volkswirtschaft weiterentwickelt gehen wir diesen weg weiter
8583137 schlie lich haben es sp und eisenbahnergewerkschaft nie akzeptiert dass vp nahe manager ein seit jahrzehnten unter sozialistischem einfluss stehendes staatsunternehmen mit dem ziel gef hrt haben dieses in ein modernes dienstleistungsunternehmen mit zukunft umzuwandeln
8583138 klugar und ich k nnten gemeinsam etwas in die richtige richtung bewegen
8583139 es ist daher eine nagelprobe f r verkehrsminister faymann wie er als eigent mervertreter zu diesem machtanspruch der gewerkschaft steht und ob er sich ihrer radikalen umf rbungspolitik unterwirft mit der die bb wieder in g nzlich sozialistisches fahrwasser gebracht werden sollen einen vorgeschmack auf die politische vereinnahmung der bb durch die sp gaben ja bereits die dubiosen medienkooperationen faymanns mit den bb wo auf kosten der bb pers nliche imagewerbung f r faymann gemacht wurde
8583140 in diesem lichte ist faymanns anbiederung an die bb und die gewerkschaft nat rlich verst ndlich f r das unternehmen bb ist das aber die absolut falsche entwicklung die bb m ssen vielmehr den eingeschlagenen reformweg weitergehen das unternehmen muss weg vom monopolistischen staatsunternehmen hin zu einem b rsef higen dienstleistungsunternehmen gebracht werden
8583141 today marks yet another significant milestone in the overall effort to transform macao into an international leisure and business destination
8583142 the key to building a successful tourist destination is being able to assemble the critical mass of attractions needed to make the location more unique and compelling than its rival destinations that is why we continue to add more and more important components like luxury retail and world class entertainment to our cotai strip development the cotai strips array of leisure entertainment and business offerings has already helped macao attract a greater number of visitors from across the region and beyond and in the longer term its popularity will further facilitate macaos evolution into an extremely successful and desirable international tourist destination
8583143 the arrival of the four seasons hotel macao combined with the world class retail brands of the shoppes at four seasons names like gucci hermes fendi louis vuitton and more is a signal that a new era of luxury has arrived in macao and that the cotai strip is ready to compete with the worlds top luxury destinations
8583144 business and leisure travelers to macao have given their seal of approval to our commitment to class and quality as a prime example in only its first year of operation the venetian macao has attracted nearly 25 million visitors and according to a study conducted by the university of macao more than 60 percent of all visitors to macao identify a trip to the venetian as their primary reason for visiting macao

8583159 janet and tealc will be here soon sir there was a mix up with the order from gilshars
8583160 this isnt one of those subtitled thingies daniel likes so much is it
8583161 it was in the bargain bin i thought it looked interesting
8583162 ill go get him in a few minutes you know what daniels like when he first wakes up
8583163 i can take care of all this if you want
8583164 otherwise known as spying on and mother henning the archaeologist
8583165 geesh you think a guy would be grateful for the company
8583166 id hate to think of what it must be up to by now
8583167 someday youre gonna get hit with the bill im thinking im gonna be sitting pretty for retirement
8583168 yeah pull out the excuses when you wanna get out of trouble
8583169 oneill doctorfraiser and i have procured your order from the house of gilshar
8583170 daniel why dont you go sit down in the den i can bring you a tray
8583171 i thought id eat in the kitchen maybe we can go out on the deck
8583172 depending on your food intake tonight colonel i may need to order some cholesterol testing
8583173 there are enough choices here for us to eat for days
8583174 with daniel sir i think it would be the most comfortable seating for him
8583175 fine but if he drools on you dont come crying to me
8583176 need i remind everyone that he is right here and i do not drool ever
8583177 doc does he or does he not drool when hes in the infirmary
8583178 doctor patient confidentiality doesnt allow me to disclose that sir
8583179 do not involve me in your attempts to besmirch danieljacksons honor
8583180 we are here to partake in an evening of cinematic enjoyment not discuss danieljacksons drooling
8583181 you interrupted me oneill i was about to add or lack thereof
8583182 most interesting oneill i believe majorcarter has outdone herself this time
8583183 shh daniel the movies starting and if you have something to read youll spend your time doing that instead of relaxing
8583184 youre just saying that because the star looks like daniel
8583185 it looks like they glued a dead squirrel on his chin
8583186 i am surprised that adam is not the one hurt if this occurred with sg 1 i am certain danieljackson would have been the one to receive such a wound
8583187 that guy that adam guy does not look like me
8583188 i wonder where they found all that building material in the middle of a desert
8583189 i believe they are meant to appeal to the male demographic majorcarter
8583190 i will however concede that if their apparel is meant to be armor it would be most impractical for fighting especially in a desert
8583191 yes and we all know the jaffa are known for their fashion sense
8583192 youd think one of those guards would have noticed adam standing in the temple
8583193 id never wear something like that on my face and he doesnt even wear glasses
8583194 if it walks like a daniel and talks like a daniel and oh my look at that even gets chased like a daniel it probably is a daniel
8583195 im going to buy the macgyver dvds and invite everyone to my place for a marathon
8583196 indeed you do not he has more hair and it is not gray
8583197 thats a new one even for daniel doc you remember if daniel ever got a poisoned arrow through the thigh
8583198 im sure i could look it up for you colonel
8583199 yes and we all know high heels are practical in a warrior society
8583200 and you would know this how daniel is there something youre not telling us
8583201 i believe this adam needs to learn more discretion when dealing with women he does not know
8583202 you have to admire a woman who knows what she wants
8583203 what is it with the two most powerful women on the planet falling for him
8583204 daniel daniel daniel me you who would you think theyd pick
8583205 you have forgotten that if sg 1 appeared on this world i would be accompanying you
8583206 and youve forgotten that that guy playing adam is not me
8583207 do you want to watch the rest of the movie or go to bed
8583208 i know ill take them before we go back to the den
8583209 it is not a particularly well done example of cinematography
8583210 would it not have been easier for them to walk to the opening in the dome
8583211 ah but then you dont get to see daniel i mean adam use his big gun
8583212 they seem to have forgotten their law that women may not kill women
8583213 nine hundred years old and not a speck of dust obviously a man came up with this plot
8583214 like the low cut metal armor didnt tell you before jan
8583215 i want to know why we didnt get to see adam showing off his chest or his ass weve been robbed
8583216 you get to see daniels ass more times than i have
8583217 why cant you get the stuff we find to work like that carter
8583218 did i neglect mentioning that techno babble is off limits tonight
8583219 is that what you call it is that what you think
8583220 i dont call it that daniel came up with the term years ago
8583221 daniel no fair hes not awake to defend himself sir
8583222 i will not assist you in this oneill you have put the sheets on your bed now it is your duty to repose on it
8583223 hell my truck doesnt start up that easily after sitting in the sgc parking lot for a couple of weeks we have to get some of that juice
8583224 what kind of a queen is she you mean shes just going to leave all her people behind
8583225 she does not deserve to be queen if she puts her own happiness above that of her people
8583226 carter did you say this was in the bargain bin
8583227 sir you have to admit it did what you wanted so it cant get an f
8583228 in that case i guess it has to rate an a plus

8583232 my family and i were excited to be a part of the independence expo it showed people with disabilities that there are many opportunities for them to achieve their goals it also gave attendees different views on living with disabilities and a better understanding of the problems that many of us face
8583233 i am truly grateful honestly i still cant believe that i won and neither can my family it was the luck of the draw
8583234 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8583235 america is facing its greatest economic challenges since the great depression
8583236 ich fliege zwei mal im monat hin und her das macht rund 250 000 dollar aus verdammt ich bin wieder auf american airlines umgestiegen
8583237 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8583238 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the we need
8583239 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8583240 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8583241 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8583242 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8583243 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8583244 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8583245 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8583246 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8583247 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8583248 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8583249 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8583250 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win

8583288 two years ago many of the children became ill only two of the ten that were ill survived tolona said that the shaman was able to cure them with an ancient remedy but that it was not successful in all cases
8583289 tell him im sorry for their loss that my sympathies are with them
8583290 look daniels sick we need to get help for him the teams coming here

8583293 listen to me carter and tealc are on their way you are not going to die
8583294 just think of all the nurses who would be fighting to spread this all over you at least it doesnt smell too bad does it kinda minty minty fresh
8583295 cmon buddy carter and tealc are gonna be here soon dont you want to be awake for them maybe you wont want to be not if doc comes along with her bag of tricks

8583303 we didnt know the nature of the medical emergency so i thought it prudent we be able to return to the stargate as quickly as possible
8583304 hes quite bruised and he has an upper respiratory infection most likely from his fall into the river
8583305 daniel wasnt coughing up the mucus that was draining into his lungs and a plug of it formed in his trachea
8583306 weve suctioned daniels lungs not a very pleasant procedure for him i might add and have him on antibiotics hes also on oxygen but by tomorrow he should be off that
8583307 that salve the shaman was using on daniel was a natural antibiotic i believe daniel would be a lot sicker if you hadnt permitted the shaman to treat him
8583308 daniels sleeping right now but if youd like to see him you may
8583309 and then sir i think you need a nice rest yourself
8583310 are you insinuating that i would defy an order from doc fraiser

8583315 i dont give a damn if you dont like what i say im not doing the sgc or you any favors if i only say what people want to hear but id hope that you would have the decency to give me the same courtesy of listening that i give to you
8583316 i dont know where we went wrong and for any responsibility i have in whats going on i apologize ive never denied who i am and i wont start now
8583317 you really think youre up to gallivanting around some new planet

8583359 de stemmen die aanvankelijk op hillary clinton werden uitgebracht bevestigden haar opmerkelijke succes in de voorverkiezingen
8583360 daarna was het tijd om de eenheid van de partij te herstellen het was opmerkelijk dat senator clinton daarbij zelf het initiatief nam een manoeuvre die was bedoeld om de harde kern van haar aanhangers ervan te overtuigen de rijen te sluiten
8583361 de nederlaag van hillary clinton was voor beide clintons moeilijk maar het is duidelijk dat zij hebben besloten dat de eenheid van de democratische partij voorgaat hun optreden in denver laat geen ruimte meer voor twijfel over hun onvoorwaardelijke steun voor obamas kandidatuur
8583362 dat obama de leiding van amerika kan overnemen en het amerikaanse leiderschap in de wereld kan herstellen

8583376 i dont have a problem with people expressing their points of view in public
8583377 i would prefer that there was serious tolerant dialogue that might emerge from this publicity campaign because it is much needed
8583378 for a 200 investment weve made we got featured in the local newspaper once twice on tv and its the buzz around town i cant get a quarter page ad for 200

8583380 they are appealing to the natural corruptions in unbelieving people the bible warns very explicitly about the dangers of greed the love of money being the root of all evil

8583382 we canceled services that day and said our service to the community will be our service
8583383 this wasnt a gimmick hey come to our church there was no bait and switch we didnt try to convert people we just wanted to show we care
8583384 there are a lot of worse things that people can be doing in life than getting people to come to church
8583385 are they being tempted to think the church is about such gimmicks and external rewards
8583386 the amount of time ive spent being interviewed about all the good things were doing and only hearing about the gas thing on the news is a little disappointing

8583420 we hope to make torchwood a gripping and surprising tv event with storylines that push our team into greater danger and sacrifice
8583421 joining our main cast are some fantastic guest artists who will only add to making this unmissable tv
8583422 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic

8583443 januvia boosts the effect of a natural body process called the incretin system
8583444 incretins are intestinal hormones which are released after food intake and they are essential for regulating blood glucose
8583445 research has shown that people with type two diabetes have an impaired incretin system so their body is unable to lower blood glucose effectively
8583446 this is the first time we have been able to address an impaired incretin system using an oral medication
8583447 by increasing the number of intact incretins in the body januvia helps to control on demand the high blood glucose levels that may contribute to serious long term health problems such as heart attack stroke kidney failure blindness nerve damage and amputation

8583499 bibelens samlivsetiske fragmenter er ikke l srevne regler men springer ut av dramatiske livserfaringer i et relativt brutalt samfunn kvinner og barn var avhengige av mannlige fors rgere og farl se og enker omtales derfor i bibelen som ytterst marginaliserte grupper

8583532 the take home message for women is that whether you are hooked on caffeine or not if you need a boost coffee improves your mental alertness and can have a calming affect on your heart rate
8583533 in addition a large coffee has more than enough caffeine to see these changes
8583534 this indicates that there may be some long term cardiovascular adjustment to digesting caffeine on a daily basis

8583538 over the past 10 years theres been a revolution of sorts in studying protein function in living systems using microscopy to follow dynamic movements and localizations of particular protein molecules
8583539 they give off multiple colors and whats particularly useful technologically is that it takes a longer time between when theyre excited with a light pulse and the time they fluoresce
8583540 one purpose of our studies is to demonstrate that we can detect lanthanide reporter tagged proteins at the single molecule limit in living cells
8583541 you add them to cell cultures and they go into cells find the protein you want to study and bind with high affinity its a straightforward way to selectively label a protein and makes it detectable
8583542 super sluggers succeeds and fails as most mario sports games do its quick arcade style action is easy to get into and plenty fun coming at the expense of the nuances and balance youll find in a sim
8583543 what it lacks in innovation and online play mario super sluggers makes up for with its robust modes fun controls and multiplayer options if youre a fan of either the characters or the sport you owe it to yourself to round these bases
8583544 multiplayer is amusing in that hanging out with your friends is fun anyway but the single player content is truly terrible a series of boring one off challenges punctuated by simplistic exploration and the occasional full game makes up marios quest to foil bowser jr via baseball yes its as insipid as it sounds

8583549 von diesen e3 ligasen gibt es fast tausend verschiedene in der pflanzenzelle sie werden ben tigt um jeweils spezielle proteine abzubauen
8583550 dahinter l sst sich eine gro e regulatorische kraft vermuten allerdings wissen wir momentan nur von wenigen dieser e3 ligasen welche proteine sie abbauen
8583551 das ging nur sehr langsam voran mit der genomsequenz und der mutantensammlung kann man deutlich schneller arbeiten die methode hei t reverse genetik diese vorgehensweise ist bei hefe und arabidopsis m glich nicht aber bei m usen und menschen

8583553 wir konnten jetzt anhand unserer untersuchungen der arabidopsis mutanten des cop9 signalosoms zeigen dass diese mutanten defekte dna str nge haben und dies k nnte der grund f r das schlechte wachstum der mutanten sein man muss annehmen dass der ausfall desselben proteinkomplexes beim menschen auch zu einem wachstumsstopp aufgrund von dna sch den f hrt

8583564 every year were only as good as our line and theyre doing a great job
8583565 coaches moved me up and i saw how hard holotik and hales worked and saw how they played this is our third year together now and we work together as a team
8583566 theyve done a great job so far theyre hard workers and theyve become dependable
8583567 when you get new players theres a trust factor they have to always show up and work hard or they wont be accepted
8583568 theyve done everything theyre supposed to weve included them as part of the team and let them know how things are done here
8583569 we cant make up for the loss but we can improve on our mistakes

8583575 there is a pronounced concentration on lgbt youth in an international array of documentary and narratives comedic musical and dramatic
8583576 whats great about these films like where the world mine xxy water lililes the lollipop generation and others is that these arent typical coming out stories they are past that these young people are impressively assertive and defiant as they try to mark out their place in the world they are not asking for permission or waiting for legislation in a word theyre fierce
8583577 also thanks to the energies of buccheri we have a record number of shorts 4 programs
8583578 they offer a compellingly global mapping of the complexities of lgbt life
8583579 works like a jihad for love be like others an island crossing and jerusalem is proud to present explore the intersections of religion and lgbt life in the islamic world iran in particular the south pacific and israel they are all at times harrowing revealing films that expand one sense of the everywhere struggle for human rights
8583580 ill limit myself to three water lilies because it is one of the best movies ever made about teenage girls a topic rarely pursued and never done well wild combination a portrait of arthur russell because in its tribute to the avant garde composer disco visionary it is formally and appropriately playful in a manner uncommon for most documentaries and rosa von praunheims 1971 funny odd very smart experimental narrative it is not the homosexual who ss perverse but the society in which he lives because its title could serve as the subtitle of most of the contemporary documentaries that we are showing

8583617 el plan de mosc es redibujar el mapa de europa
8583618 cualquier duda sobre por qu rusia invadi georgia han desaparecido reconociendo ilegalmente los territorios georgianos de abjazia y osetia del sur ha quedado claro que la intenci n de mosc es redibujar el mapa de europa usando la fuerza mosc est usando la invasi n preparada durante a os para reconstruir su imperio conseguir mayor control sobre el suministro energ tico a europa y castigar a los que creen que la democracia puede florecer en sus fronteras europa tiene razones para preocuparse afortunadamente la mayor a de la comunidad internacional ha condenado la invasi n y confirmado su respaldo incondicional a la integridad territorial y a la soberan a de georgia
8583619 si es cierta la tesis de que vladimir putin sigue siendo el hombre fuerte en rusia y que el procedimiento sigue su dise o hay que hablar con l

8583621 el jefe del mae brit nico david miliband visit ayer kiev la v spera hab a lanzado la iniciativa de crear una amplia coalici n internacional para contrarrestar la agresi n de rusia contra georgia v ktor y schenko se ha mostrado de acuerdo con semejante planteamiento de la cuesti n el apoyo de ucrania a las posiciones de occidente en relaci n a osetia del sur y abjazia augura a kiev un pronto ingreso en la otan sin embargo los expertos advierten que los dirigentes ucranianos se est n inmiscuyendo estos d as en un juego ajeno cuyo resultado ser la creaci n de un tel n de acero que sencillamente no pasar a por el territorio de ucrania sino que amenazar dividir al pa s en dos mitades el conflicto en el c ucaso ha atra do al poder ucraniano a la rbita de los poderes occidentales nunca antes este pa s se hab a mostrado tan activamente participativo en las conversaciones y consultas internacionales como desde el momento de su declaraci n de independencia
8583622 por fin miliband dice las palabras adecuadas con la imagen adecuada
8583623 miliband vol ayer a ucrania para pronunciar el discurso m s apasionado y preciso ofrecido por un miembro del gobierno brit nico en la crisis de georgia con fuertes advertencias a rusia y c lidos nimos para los dos peque os pa ses ex sovi ticos eso no quiere decir que el ministro de asuntos exteriores animara a ucrania o a georgia como deber a haberlo hecho fue vago en si gran breta a respaldar a una oferta formal para ingresaran en la otan en diciembre lo que sugiere que el gobierno no se ha deshecho de su desafortunada ambig edad t ctica de principios de a o de todas formas fue un poderoso discurso que ten a que pronunciarse
8583624 comparado con el casi mon stico silencio de su jefe david miliband se ha pronunciado sobre la invasi n rusa de georgia habiendo visitado tbilisi la semana pasada ayer viaj a ucrania otro pa s cuyos deseos de unirse a la otan han enfadado al kremlin el ministro de exteriores dijo que estaba all para respaldar la elecci n democr tica de sus anfitriones su presencia en la capital de ucrania tuvo una importancia simb lica y su an lisis de la situaci n fue directo sin embargo al hablar de sanciones tuvo poco que decir aparte de disminuir la dependencia energ tica de rusia
8583625 como primer an lisis la decisi n de nicolas sarkozy de recurrir a un aumento de impuestos para financiar un nuevo gasto social es vivamente criticable se inscribe en una tradici n muy francesa a cada problema responde generalmente una nueva tasa no es entonces escandaloso que en el momento en que la inflaci n golpea brutalmente a los m s modestos se pida la contribuci n de los que tienen un patrimonio financiero este razonamiento s lo vale si se cree en la eficacia del ingreso de solidaridad activa para sacar de la exclusi n a los que siguen al margen del mercado del empleo inspirado por el impuesto negativo experimentado en estados unidos por clinton y en el reino unido por tony blair el rsa puede convertirse en una de las m s importantes reformas del quinquenato sarkozy
8583626 tremonti hay que realizarlo absolutamente tambi n en la parte fiscal
8583627 federalismo gobernabilidad y retorno a los valores tradicionales dios patria y familia ste es el mensaje del ministro de econom a giulio tremonti en el meeting de r mini 60 a os de la constituci n y retos del futuro como programa de la nueva tercera era pol tica del pa s inaugurada por el gobierno berlusconi lo observa con asombro giulio andreotti que como buen romano piensa que el centralismo de la capital sea intocable aunque no hay que eliminar la peculiaridad de las regiones
8583628 tremonti arremete el federalismo hay que realizarlo tambi n en la parte fiscal cuando se consiga el objetivo todos ganar n perder s lo la mala pol tica es decir una gesti n irresponsable del patrimonio p blico y fiscal que ha producido un aumento inaguantable de la deuda y del d ficit el federalismo no reduce las funciones del estado sino que las concentra en lo esencial trasladando a los gobiernos locales funciones administrativas y poder fiscal
8583629 tremonti ideolog as ca das hay que volver a dios patria y familia
8583630 el jefe del gobierno silvio berlusconi regresa de sus vacaciones para ocuparse de alitalia justicia reformas y ley electoral en vista de las elecciones europeas tres oras de reuni n con bossi para concluir el federalismo hay que hacerlo nos lo piden los italianos calderoli confirma que la relaci n entre berlusconi y bossi es ptima
8583631 por primera vez en muchas d cadas tiene lugar una confrontaci n extremadamente peligrosa entre un grupo de barcos de guerra de la otan y de rusia ayer al d a siguiente del reconocimiento por parte de mosc de osetia del sur y abjazia nav os de guerra rusos entraron en aguas de abjazia cualquier paso imprudente un disparo el lanzamiento de un torpedo misil o una maniobra peligrosa podr a socavar la situaci n
8583632 en aguas del mar negro se encuentran actualmente tres barcos de ee uu cuatro turcos uno de espa a otro de alemania y otro m s de polonia nuestra respuesta ha sido enviar un grupo naval a sujumi a petici n del presidente abjaso dos corbetas misil sticas y el crucero misil stico mosc es indudable que el grupo naval de la otan supera al de la flota del mar negro en potencial militar pero rusia puede ayudarse de otros tipos de armamentos incluyendo aviaci n
8583633 las declaraciones de ucrania acent an la confrontaci n seg n ella rusia debe prepararse para retirar su flota de sebastopol pero el estado mayor ruso ya ha respondido no cabe esperar retirar la flota antes de que expire en 2017 el acuerdo bilateral
8583634 entre rusia y occidente se est creando un nuevo tel n de acero en cuya frontera estar ucrania considera vladimir fesenko director del centro de investigaci n penta bajo la presi n de sus electores el l der del partido de las regiones v ktor yanukovich que ha estado largo tiempo evitando realizar comentarios exhort el martes a los poderes a que reconocieran la independencia de abjazia y osetia del sur por otra parte las relaciones de y schenko y yulia timoshenko han empeorado gravemente a consecuencia de la situaci n en el c ucaso y de la participaci n ucraniana
8583635 occidente ha terminado por definir qu pa s puede convertirse en el pr ximo objetivo de mosc el jefe del mae franc s bernard kouchner ha declarado que existe peligro de un ataque ruso a crimea y el jefe del mae brit nico david miliband acudi a kiev para advertir a las autoridades ucranianas de que no den a mosc un pretexto para un ataque militar en ucrania entretanto los acontecimientos en georgia ya han provocado una nueva crisis pol tica que puede conducir a la rotura de la coalici n de gobierno las duras pero inconcretas declaraciones de los pa ses occidentales hablan a las claras de que a n no se han recuperado de la impresi n y que todav a no se ha elaborado una posici n unida sobre c mo reaccionar ante la conducta de mosc posiblemente no surja hasta el lunes cuando comience en bruselas una reuni n de urgencia en la cumbre de la uni n europea
8583636 adem s es evidente que la actitud de muchos pa ses hacia rusia ha cambiado sustancialmente as hace una semana se consideraba a francia como uno de los socios m s fiables y un pa s relativamente prorruso en comparaci n con otros miembros de la ue sin embargo sarkozy y kouchner se han tomado el reconocimiento de abjazia y osetia del sur como una ofensa personal pese a que las autoridades rusas aseguran que siguen cumpliendo el plan sarkozy
8583637 eeuu otan y las potencias europeas atacan con suavidad la decisi n de mosc
8583638 desafiando los estados unidos y europa el presidente ruso dmitri medvedev anunci ayer que hab a afirmado un decreto que reconoc a la independencia de las regiones separatistas georgianas como osetia del sur y abjazia los estados unidos otan y potencias europeas atacan con suavidad la decisi n de mosc
8583639 la secretaria del consejo de estado de eeuu condoleezza rice lo describi como lamentable mientras la primera ministra de alemania angela merkel lo denomin como absolutamente inaceptable gran breta a rechaz categ ricamente la decisi n y francia expres su consternaci n pero en realidad la capacidad del occidente para castigar a rusia es limitada
8583640 sanciones de las naciones unidas contra rusia est fuera de la cuesti n puesto que rusia tiene un voto en el consejo de seguridad las principales potencias tambi n se preocupan por que cualquier acci n pueda hacer que rusia retire su apoyo contra ir n sobre su programa nuclear y deje su apoyo a las fuerzas de otan en afganist n podr a implicar represalias a rusia excluir a mosc del grupo g8 ochos principales pa ses industrializados y democr ticos o bloquear su solicitud para entrar en la organizaci n mundial del comercio
8583641 por qu haber lanzado este desaf o a los europeos y a los americanos las razones son m ltiples desestabilizar a georgia para impedirle entrar en la otan favorecer la instalaci n en tiflis la capital georgiana de un poder que obedecer a al kremlin y que se centrar sobre los proyectos de gaseoductos destinados a aligerar la dependencia energ tica de los europeos respecto de rusia crear un precedente que disuadir a su vez las veleidades de ucrania de entrar en la otan es decir aplicar a sus dos vecinos una doctrina de la soberan a limitada que el kremlin no ha estado en medida de imponer a los dem s durante la fragmentaci n de la urss hoy el gas y el petr leo alimentan un nacionalismo ruso revanchista que s lo tiene un objetivo rehacer el imperio deshecho esta ambici n la uni n europa la favoreci con su complacencia es urgente que defina una pol tica rusa responsable
8583642 reconociendo la independencia de abjazia y osetia del sur el kremlin ha redibujado el mapa del ca caso por la fuerza tambi n se ha perjudicado enormemente
8583643 la crisis en el ca caso se est deteriorando con rapidez los pol ticos norteamericanos quiz distra dos con su poca de convenciones pueden haber asumido que rusia se contentar a con el control de facto de abjazia y osetia del sur pero no es as el reconocimiento de la independencia de las dos provincias por parte del presidente medvedev es tan provocativo como la invasi n original como su predecesor a medvedev le gusta decir que no hubo ganadores en la guerra fr a se equivoca rusia perdi aquel conflicto y con l un imperio su econom a se ha recuperado espectacularmente pero sus l deres no quieren ver los riesgos de tratar de reafirmar su hegemon a regional por la fuerza
8583644 rusia intenta atraer a china hacia un bloque anti occidental
8583645 china se pronunci ayer sobre la crisis en georgia afirmando estar preocupada pero en tono menos duro que el de la mayor a de los pa ses occidentales rusia est bajo presi n despu s de haber reconocido anteayer la independencia de osetia del sur y de abjazia dos regiones separatistas georgianas sobre esta crisis georgiana se habla de nuevo en guerra fr a pero algunos analistas explican los desarrollos diplom ticos ocurridos con la formaci n de dos bloques los rusos intentando entenderse con los chinos y los occidentales ampliando su alianza
8583646 medvedev enfrenta hoy en la cumbre de la organizaci n de cooperaci n de shangai una prueba muy reveladora de la relaci n de fuerzas con el occidente pek n est en un dilema le interesa reforzar las relaciones con rusia pero defiende intransigentemente la primac a de la integridad territorial y de las fronteras internacionalmente reconocidas no aprecia el principio de la autodeterminaci n invocado en sus regiones criticas el tibet budista y el xinjiang musulm n
8583647 este oeste europa apost en febrero y perdi en agosto
8583648 en febrero la mayor a de los pa ses de la ue animados por eeuu tomaron ciertas libertades con el derecho internacional y reconocieron la independencia de kosovo prestaron o dos sordos a las protestas estruendosas de mosc no cabe la menor duda de que nuestros dirigentes se equivocaron gravemente resulta evidente que europa se dej llevar por el juego apost y perdi
8583649 rusia acude en busca de apoyo internacional a su aliado natural china pero se equivoca en el c lculo ya que pek n teme un apoyo exterior a sus propios separatismos por lo que dmitri medvedev s lo ha obtenido el apoyo de hu jintao a los jjoo de invierno en sotchi china siempre se ha escudado detr s del principio de no ingerencia con vistas a evitar que los extranjeros se inmiscuyan a su vez en los asuntos interiores

8583652 de esta forma la unanimidad de anta o que caracterizaba a las cumbres de esta organizaci n en esta ocasi n podr a venirse abajo dado que sus miembros en los que aparte de china tambi n figuran kazajst n tadjikist n kirguizist n y uzbekist n no desean que se les plante la cuesti n de a qui n apoyan en esta situaci n para estos pa ses es mucho m s sencillo preservar cierta neutralidad

8583655 con su marido mirando con ternura y sus partidarios observ ndola con l grimas en los ojos la senadora hillary clinton aplaz el martes su propio sue o y pronunci una enf tica petici n a la convenci n nacional dem crata para cerrar filas tras su rival el senador barack obama
8583656 la senadora clinton que en su d a tuvo la certeza de que ganar a la nominaci n dem crata este a o tambi n dio anoche pasos pasos deliberados seg n se alaron sus asesores para mantener abierta la puerta a una futura candidatura a la presidencia declar ndose a s misma como una orgullosa defensora de barack obama la senadora clinton exhort a los dem cratas a dejar de lado su fidelidad hacia ella y unirse para respaldar a obama o arriesgarse a continuar con las pol ticas de la administraci n bush bajo el mandato del eventual candidato republicano el senador john mccain
8583657 dado que la econom a es la principal preocupaci n del votante estadounidense no es de extra ar que barack obama subrayara las ra ces de clase obrera de joe biden cuando lo present la semana pasada como su compa ero de ticket electoral sin embargo la gran aportaci n de biden es su importante experiencia en pol tica exterior y esa es su mayor contribuci n al ticket
8583658 obama ha elegido bien al seleccionar a alguien que puede contrarrestar su principal debilidad la inexperiencia y que puede estar a la altura del principal valor del republicano john mccain conocimiento de temas de seguridad nacional el desaf o para el d o dem crata ser mostrar al electorado que el conocimiento de temas de pol tica exterior no es solo una herramienta electoral sino algo necesario para gobernar estados unidos en el siglo xxi
8583659 a n no se sabe si los dem cratas conseguir n salir de su bache al final del congreso en denver el candidato republicano john mccain y el candidato dem crata barack obama est n igualados en las encuestas y la recuperada unidad interna del partido a n no ha tenido que superar ninguna prueba pero una cosa ya est clara gracias a hillary clinton el partido entra fortalecido en la carrera por la casa blanca
8583660 clinton ha vuelto a demostrar que pod a haber sido perfectamente la candidata de los dem cratas esta vez no ha funcionado y lo ha admitido pero est preparada quiz s para dentro de cuatro a os
8583661 los dem cratas a n no han ganado la casa blanca pero ahora vuelven a tener buenas posibilidades no es el m rito personal de hillary clinton pero s ha coronado el giro en denver los dem cratas se han encontrado a si mismos vuelven a creer en su propia fuerza
8583662 4 de noviembre el d a de dar una patada a los republicanos
8583663 los dem cratas pueden estar dudando pero deben mantener la fe en que el electorado castigar duramente los desastres de bush
8583664 si la convenci n de este fin de semana no consigue aumentar ampliamente el respaldo a obama como estaba previsto significa que las elecciones presidenciales han terminado antes de empezar y el mundo debe prepararse para otros cuatro a os de gobierno republicano la respuesta es enf ticamente no los procedimientos bizantinos de nominaci n de los dem cratas y sus ideas sobre justicia electoral les han llevado a elegir al menos elegible de sus dos principales candidatos como resultado han perdido la oportunidad de convertir el desastre de la presidencia de bush en un una mayor a electoral aplastante al estilo roosevelt es muy pronto para descartar a los dem cratas a pesar del mal comienzo de su campa a porque seg n se aproxima el d a de las votaciones los votantes se dar n cuenta de que esta elecci n no tiene nada que ver con los dem cratas o las relaciones de obama con los clinton tiene que ver con los republicanos john mccain y sus relaciones con george bush
8583665 el partido de obama de los guetos a la casa blanca
8583666 hoy la candidatura presidencial de obama sea elegido para la casa a bianca o no muestra cuanto han cambiado las condiciones en la m xima sociedad pluri tnica del mundo y de su misma poblaci n de color
8583667 los sondeos de opini n oscilan entre las distintas opciones en materia econ mica o social desde el punto de vista de las perspectivas internacionales hay quien acusa a obama de mantener una pol tica reticente o incierta y hay quien teme en cambio un peligroso intervencionismo del veterano de guerra mccain aunque a veces los militares son los menos belicistas como demostr eisenhower que logr cerrar el conflicto coreano
8583668 al nuevo presidente se le van a platear muchas cuestiones resolver la adversa coyuntura econ mica adem s de encauzar los conflictos en irak y en afganist n combatir las conspiraciones hijaidistas en el pakist n post musharraf remediar las idas y venidas de bush en georgia y en fin tener que v rsela con los desaf os de putin llegados a este punto no ser a deseable para los estados unidos la elecci n de obama s lo porque este haya exhibido tan generosamente su emancipada y generosa ingenuidad sino mas bien por su talento tampoco ser a deseable la elecci n del arrugado mccain por su latente psicolog a discriminatoria incluso aunque se debiera a una razonable reacci n de rechazo a la excesiva obamamania elitista o medi tica propagada hasta ahora
8583669 bill clinton no escuchar el discurso de victoria de obama
8583670 ive always been optimistic in my lifetime that our country could or would elect a person of color or even a woman president of the united states and barack obama not just because he is an african american hes the right person at the right time
8583671 and im especially proud of our country and our ability to put people like barack obama in position to lead our country
8583672 i am proud as an american and glad to see it happen in my lifetime i believe this was inevitable because this is the usa where we support leaders regardless of their race
8583673 i dont know if i believed that it would happen in my lifetime as much as i hoped that it would happen in my lifetime i certainly believed that it was possible and that was demonstrated to me by the notion that colin powell might run at the time he was considering it
8583674 as far as how i feel about it what barack obama has accomplished and the fact that he is standing at the threshold of the american presidency for me it reaffirms what i have believed for a long time and that is this country is not as racially divided as some may suggest i have always believed for a very long time that we are a better nation and that the racial divide that existed so many years ago is no longer what it used to be i would sum it up to say this is no longer my grandfathers america this is my america i will feel just an enormous sense of pride for country just a great sense of pride to be an american
8583675 as an african american yes i did think that this would happen in my lifetime when i think back i am reminded of the people who thought they would not see slavery end in their lifetime i think of all the people who did not believe that they would see dr martin luther king jr s birthday as a national holiday in their lifetime and i think about all the other first time events that have taken place that we thought we would never see in our lifetime this is framed in the promise that is america african americans have always been key in bringing america back when america has strayed from the founding documents that this country was founded on even though african americans were originally not part of the plan the constitution the declaration of independence and other documents are documents we hold to be self evident

8583680 its too bad hes worked very hard and i know being a high profile pick a no 1 pick theres a lot of pressure put on that and expectations of fans
8583681 its not his fault and hes trying his best to get back and were still counting on him to help us this year
8583682 i dont know eventually we hope that hes the good player we think he is we dont think theres anything fundamentally wrong with him we dont think its a lack of toughness we just think hes just had some bad luck
8583683 we do not have to worry about too many other players i believe we have the needed squad and a strong squad i believe in the players i have instead of always looking at who might be coming in
8583684 it is not one player who makes a difference it is up to us as a team to show personality strength and belief if we can find one more we will do it if not we will not limit our ambitions because of it
8583685 i do not know why we are always under pressure to buy 30 or 40m players
8583686 i am under pressure to buy good players it is as simple as that and good players are not always necessarily linked with the price
8583687 the names dont impress me what is impressive for me is the attitude the quality all the rest is part of the media
8583688 there is only one thing thats important and that is what you do on the pitch i agree that what we did on the pitch on saturday was not good enough but to compare the team with names is not very interesting and not very useful
8583689 i focus on my players i believe in my players i dont focus on the names of other players at other clubs

8583717 es ist nicht nur ein mehrheitliches gef hl der bev lkerung dass sie vom aufschwung nicht profitiert es ist realit t trotz eines gut dreij hrigen konjunkturaufschwungs ist die reale einkommenssituation vieler haushalte heute schlechter als zuvor
8583718 der erzwungene verzicht auf angemessene an inflationsziel und produktivit tssteigerung orientierte lohnsteigerungen hat sich nicht gelohnt
8583719 letztlich waren die unternehmen bei guter internationaler und nationaler konjunktur nicht gezwungen die geringen arbeitskostensteigerungen vollst ndig in den preisen weiterzugeben und diese bei einrechnung der produktivit tsfortschritte entsprechend zu senken stattdessen konnten sie ihre gewinnmargen erh hen
8583720 konnte der aufschwung von den unternehmen dieses mal f r eine massive umverteilung zu ihren gunsten genutzt werden
8583721 i always dress like this when im serving behind the bar as our aim is to keep the old traditions alive
8583722 brewing began at ma pardoes in 1835 as before 1830 there was no such thing as a public house just inns tavern and coach houses
8583723 the beer act changed all that and by 1872 there were 6 000 home brew pubs
8583724 another thing that has changed at the pub is that we have a restaurant upstairs and it follows our tradition of making things on the premises as even the ice cream is produced here
8583725 we only used to open for lunch and then would close until 6pm
8583726 this meant everyone would meet at the pub at the same times whereas now people drift in and out all day and the banter that was exchanged over a game of dominoes or darts has almost disappeared
8583727 our goal is to try to improve the forecast of severe weather as opposed to the daily forecast of weather that might disrupt a softball game but its not really going to tear your house down
8583728 you are watching the hurricane move towards the coast and you think oh its making landfall down by savannah georgia and i live in myrtle beach so im clear and then bam you get hit by a tornado
8583729 they happen a lot and people are caught unaware across the carolinas in 2004 and 2005 alone there were over 130 tornadoes in association with just seven tropical cyclones none of which actually made landfall on the north carolina coast it was just the remnants moving through its a fairly important forecast issue for our area
8583730 the traditional conceptual model is that the individual storms that comprise the hurricane rain bands are ordinary over the ocean and the increase in surface friction over land creates the miniature supercells
8583731 what we have been finding is that you can actually have these miniature supercells form out over the ocean and then produce tornados on or very near the beach
8583732 we are trying to provide proof of concept through high density observations
8583733 ultimately if we can understand what causes the supercell out over the open ocean then we can help forecasters to detect them earlier with radar and give everyone a little more forewarning
8583734 why cant rapid detox be used with cocaine addicts or with alcoholics who suffer from extreme withdrawal symptoms
8583735 the big concern is that overexploitation is causing the fish to evolve the finding that humans can actually cause evolution of fish populations which in turn can drive their degradation is relatively new and is drawing a lot of attention
8583736 some fisheries including that for cod are now known to cause juvenescence or the evolution of younger smaller adult fish the ecological and economic consequences both appear to be negative
8583737 with cod populations at historic lows and challenges to rebuild them mounting it is important to explore the past for clues about characteristics such as stock sizes exploitation rates age and size structure etc and what ecological roles cod would have played when their populations were larger

8583754 i have never met a japanese man who did not want me to be his mommy
8583755 this suggests that the decrease in fertility is due almost entirely to an increase in women of reproductive age not getting married and not having children

8583777 la prioridad colectiva es la seguridad y por tanto para alcanzarla hay que asumir riesgos y pagar costos sean stos diplom ticos o econ micos
8583778 al no existir prohibici n expresa o una regulaci n internacional para este tipo de operaciones m s all de los principios consignados en la carta de las naciones unidas y otros tratados internacionales el consejo de seguridad no discute estas cuestiones
8583779 la legitimidad de estas operaciones residir en cada caso en las justificaciones o motivos que cada parte involucrada argumente a la hora de defenderlas o condenarlas en cualquier caso ser a absurdo pensar siquiera en el establecimiento de una instituci n o foro internacional con estos fines la esencia de una operaci n encubierta es precisamente sa su confidencialidad absoluta
8583780 fue una decisi n muy dif cil el reconocimiento de las rep blicas que se adopt teniendo en cuenta sus consecuencias y tras un an lisis sobrio de la situaci n a partir de la historia de los pueblos osetas y abjasos su aspiraci n a ser independientes los tr gicos acontecimientos ocurridos las ltimas semanas y los precedentes internacionales relacionados con el reconocimiento de nuevos estados
8583781 nuestras tropas entraron en el territorio de georgia para destruir las bases desde las cuales se realiz la agresi n contra osetia del sur y despu s nos retiramos nosotros logramos restablecer la paz pero no pudimos extinguir el temor y las aspiraciones de los pueblos de osetia del sur y abjasia en situaciones cuando saakashvili con el apoyo de estados unidos y pa ses de la otan continu hablando sobre el restablecimiento del poder b lico del ej rcito georgiano y de acciones para restablecer el control en todo el territorio georgiano
8583782 algunos de esos gobiernos resultaron incompetentes al momento de establecer sus relaciones con las minor as tnicas y georgia inmediatamente anul a osetia del sur y abjasia la autonom a que hab an disfrutado en calidad de rep blicas aut nomas en el seno de la georgia sovi tica
8583783 ellos occidente optaron por proteger al presidente mijail saakashvili cuyo primer paso fue despojar la autonom a a la regi n de adzharia otra rep blica aut noma en el seno de georgia y nunca ocult su prop sito de aplastar a los surosetas y los abjasos
8583784 en las relaciones internacionales usted no puede tener unas reglas para unos y normas diferentes para el resto
8583785 en la noche del 7 y la madrugada del 8 de agosto supimos la raz n s lo un demente pudo emprender un paso de semejantes magnitudes acaso crey saakashvili que rusia permanecer a al margen mientras el ordenaba una agresi n contra la ciudad dormida de tsjinvali asesinando centenares de civiles indefensos muchos de ellos ciudadanos rusos supuso que es rusia permanecer a de brazos cruzados mientras las tropas de paz georgianas abrieron fuego contra sus colegas rusos cuya misi n conjunta era evitar la violencia en osetia del sur
8583786 i have no idea where the origin of that speculation arose from
8583787 we have a long term arrangement with shannon and they have had a massive increase in passenger numbers with ryanair now accounting for almost two thirds of passengers and we have been a massive lifeline to shannon and the mid west region
8583788 the cork situation is entirely different because dublin airport authority daa sets the agenda and the prices dictates commercial policy in cork and the autonomy promised by seamus brennan back in 2004 hasnt materialised and they are unable to make any decision for the benefit of the region
8583789 all airlines are eligible to apply for route support through the route support scheme when introducing new destinations the scheme operates over a five year period and is based on a sliding scale with a 100 per cent discount in year one
8583790 in the second year of operation the discount moves to 80 per cent and so on over the five year period the purpose of the sliding scale is to facilitate development of new routes at start up
8583791 we entered the routes on the basis that there would be a zero charge which barely made cork competitive compared to many airports on offer across europe we clearly told the management in cork at the time that if the costs increased at any time subsequent to the introduction of the routes we would withdraw them
8583792 to think that this is being caused by a 2 80 cost increase on 200 000 passengers is an outrageous step by cork airport authority
8583793 we want to play with the best and to do that we had to qualify for the group stage it was a big mental test

8584051 i saw a very interesting complex woman who had been reduced to saying what a good mom she was and how cute her meeting with barack was

8584067 zu dem besuch bei familie pham kam es nachdem sie in der volksstimme von den scheibeneinw rfen gelesen hatte und dabei auch herausgefunden hatte dass es nicht zum ersten mal war dass die familie gesch digt wurde

8584072 das hat uns mut gemacht und gezeigt dass die meisten menschen uns als friedfertige menschen akzeptieren

8584091 a brother to weeds ferns and flowers born a slave he faced life as a master while his masters light shone through his eyes he is as free as the flowers which give themselves to the sunshine and to the dew because he is so like the flowers in his relaxation and selflessness the flowers give up their secrets to him
8584092 love the single antidote for every destructive thought and passion not only heals the wounds inflicted by them but opens the individual to the purging flow of that great power which alone can make him immune to them forever more all channels physical mental and spiritual which have shrunk under the bitter lash of negative thoughts and emotions until they are tightly closed relax again at the vivifying caress of love
8584093 those luminous souls which blaze brightly in their passage through the human firmament are the fruit of a least one instant of perfect love whether found in cottage or in palace and as there are considerably more cottages than palaces in the world that ratio is apt to be reflected in their respective contributions to the ranks of notable of the earth
8584094 i dont care either way i just wish you wouldnt do it so blatantly in our own home
8584095 if i want a mistress i shall damn well have one your father cant protect you from the grave
8584096 my fathers dead but its nice to see your father is still very much alive
8584097 i wonder do you see him every day as i do when you look in the mirror
8584098 there was no verbal response just a short sharp slap to the side of her face that sent her tumbling of the couch and her book skidding across the floor
8584099 the man i married has long since left this castle

8584108 nous lavons emport lors dune campagne pendant laquelle les r publicains disaient que j tais trop jeune et trop inexp riment pour devenir commandant en chef
8584109 cela na pas march en 1992 parce que nous tions du bon c t de lhistoire et cela ne marchera pas non plus en 2008 parce que barack obama est du bon c t de lhistoire
8584110 the politics of jealously or envy or a sense that somehow were going to be less likely to vote for someone because theyve achieved economic success
8584111 i decided i might get a chance to vote for a woman in my lifetime but i probably wont get another chance to vote for someone like mr obama so i thought i better grab it
8584112 i wished it and i hoped it but i never thought id be able to see it
8584113 never in my wildest dreams would i have expected this
8584114 i think that many didnt want to get their hopes up too high and some refused to dare to dream that it could really happen
8584115 as time went on and people learned about barack obama we began to believe that the u s would truly elect a president based on substance and not on race
8584116 the message it sends to the world on behalf of the nation is that we have moved beyond race as the defining factor in our country
8584117 weve got to draw a sharp contrast with the other side not with words but with deeds
8584118 knock down the silly rumors and negativity that comes from the other side
8584119 we go on the offense about that message of change that we need a better economy that four more years of spiraling deficits and job loss and increasing energy and food costs and more home foreclosures is not what we need
8584120 senator mccain is squandering his career in public service with these kinds of slimy operators
8584121 this shows a disrespect for the electorate a belief that they are dumb and can be manipulated
8584122 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8584123 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8584124 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8584125 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8584126 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8584127 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8584128 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need

8584134 many people with imperfect sight are benefited by breathing one of the best methods is to separate the teeth while keeping the lips closed breathe deeply as if one were yawning when done properly one can feel the air cold as it passes through the nose and down the throat this method of breathing secures a great amount of relaxation of the nose throat the body generally including the eyes and ears

8584143 like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8584144 barack obama is ready to lead america ready to be president of the united states
8584145 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8584146 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8584147 that campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8584148 from the division and fear of the last eight years
8584149 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8584150 in this case the third time is not the charm

8584152 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus

8584157 in the past two years anti retroviral drugs have become available for free meaning some hiv positive people previously unknown to the authorities are now being reported
8584158 in the philippines the low partner exchange the frequency or the number of male clients of prostitutes frequenting other partners the contributory factor of circumcision those are some of the conditions that have somehow kept the hiv prevalence low
8584159 but what were saying is it does mask the threat because it might not reveal the changes in the way hiv is spreading

8584176 que en los ltimos tres meses han sido hallados m s de 1
8584177 que el porqu existen tantos ping inos en el litoral brasile o es otra pregunta y son necesarios m s estudios para responder si se debe al calentamiento global o a la falta de falta de peces para alimentarse
8584178 el hecho que lleguen tantos demuestra que han de alejarse m s de las costa para encontrar comida porque hay demasiada pesca aqu as que son m s vulnerables a las fuertes corrientes

8584187 if you want to do reprogramming it doesnt take great insight to figure out that the key genes are transcription factors the proteins that bind dna and tell cells which genes to turn on and which to turn off
8584188 indistinguishable from endogenous islet beta cells in size shape and ultrastructure

8584196 a tent or a cottage why should i care theyre building a palace for me over there
8584197 by faith we understand that the universe was formed at gods command so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible
8584198 if it were not so i would have told you
8584199 look forward to the city with foundations whose architect and builder is god
8584200 for here we do not have an enduring city but we are looking for the city that is to come
8584201 he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion

8584205 we fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal
8584206 sen clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8584207 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8584208 you are seeking me not because you saw signs but because you ate your fill of the loaves
8584209 do not labor for the food that perishes but for the food that endues to eternal life which the son of man will give to you

8584221 we cant go on this way ideals are eroding and weve got to regain the ground
8584222 too much has gone too far and neil has stepped in to ask some very profound questions about some fuzzy areas making us step back and look at ourselves
8584223 a lot of time has been wasted due to unstructured time
8584224 possibly this is due to more activities but back then people were far more addicted to their service this commitment has been eroded by personal time and self interest
8584225 students wanted to be listened to and treated like adults slowly this has changed the college
8584226 you have to accept that students have to be naughty sometimes
8584227 but you have to pay the penance if you do something wrong
8584228 liberal back then meant that you were free to express and voice your opinions
8584229 now it seems like more of a i can do whatever i want selfish liberalisation
8584230 its more of the outside world seeping in you see boorish young people everywhere in the world
8584231 perhaps this is one reason why the community appears to be pushed apart
8584232 sometimes there might not be strong enough reason for some to try their best to make it work because friends and home are only an email away
8584233 interestingly neil has spent most of his teaching career outside britain never we are fortunate to have someone to import a different culture and mentality to this place

8584235 prudence would dictate that we leave the text as it is until our candidate catches up with us

8584239 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8584240 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8584241 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8584242 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8584243 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8584244 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win

8584246 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8584247 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8584248 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8584249 barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8584250 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up
8584251 we in law enforcement deal with ethics every day of our lives
8584252 our behavior reflects not only on us as individuals but on our agencies our state and our nation
8584253 is it legal what about a police officer acting in self defense or the defense of another it may be legal it may be moral it may be ethical it may not be
8584254 you have no doubt that the suspect is the kidnapper of a 12 year old girl that girl is a diabetic and will die in a matter of hours if she does not receive her medication is it ethical to use force to get him to tell you where she is
8584255 how imminent is the death of that girl are you acting in the defense of another
8584256 as i stood there and looked at the symbol of american strength crumbling nothing in my career prepared me for that
8584257 as long as the person has a solid support system
8584258 the best way to change an existing reality is not to confront it directly but to create an alternative reality that makes the old reality obsolete
8584259 hopefully with the increased inflow and a slight decrease in that outflow well be able to build back some of the water loss
8584260 i dont go into these things with a particular idea
8584261 we have received three or four valuable offers none of which panned out
8584262 the board thought it was important that whomever took control of the property had the ability to renovate it without putting tax dollars to it
8584263 i would appreciate the countys assistance in my acquiring loans if necessary from financial institutions
8584264 we never missed it was a regular thing for us to go to church
8584265 this is the second time and it is a record for the history of the festival we have five american films in competition
8584266 the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford
8584267 it was an honor to receive this last year and it remains an honor to accept this this year
8584268 we will see 21 films and i hope and i have a lot of confidence in marco that we will see 21 films that will give us the state of art of what is cinema today
8584269 we started writing the movie as kind of an exercise thinking of what kind of parts these actors might play what kind of story they might inhabit
8584270 it could have been a dog movie or an outer space movie we just kind of landed on a spy movie
8584271 some of the colossal challenges before waec now are the needs to undertake online registration of students for examinations to undertake electronic testing and marking of tests
8584272 between barack obama and abraham lincoln look at the following questions and try to guess which is which
8584273 jeffrey was a great guy who always made you laugh he didnt have a mean bone in his body jeff was so happy especially that he and the love of his life jill decided to marry
8584274 death is never easy but jeff passing away like that is doubly tragic for his bride
8584275 speed may have been a factor but no cause for the crash has yet been established
8584276 jeff was pretty banged up after that accident in 2005 and was out of work for some time

8584282 150 let me teach you some history if you only joined club penguin in december 2007 or january 2008 the yelow puffle was a romour until halloween 2007 where they were found at the top of the hill amp and in the forest evert 30 minutes amp nearly a year ago there was a party for the 100th issue
8584283 i would have no hesitation in recommending people to take a gap year in their late 20s or 30s
8584284 i dont think this is a bad time to take a year out we expect the market to remain much the same for 2008 and into 2009 but we project things will pick up by 2010
8584285 if youve worked for a number of years before heading off you will always have that good solid experience behind you in any case most people who take this option are still quite young when they come back and employers certainly dont look unfavourably on it
8584286 employers know people who have gone travelling for a year are less likely to take off again quickly also it tends to make people more rounded
8584287 this is a pretty conservative view a gap year of this kind wont impede you the only thing that might happen is it will take a little longer to get to the place in your career you ultimately want to reach
8584288 going travelling for a year and not working is fine but when you return and go for job interviews dont feel embarrassed by this be very clear on why you chose this route and stick to it you can add that now youre back youre 100pc focused if you approach it like that no employer will have a problem with it

8584292 ho remato dallaltra parte dellisola dove sono naufragata quando la mia nave e affondata
8584293 sei stata fortunata che una barca sia stata trascinata a riva insieme a te
8584294 no lho fatta io con materiale grezzo che ho trovato sullisola i remi li ho ricavati da una pianta di caucciu il fondo lho fatto con rami di palme e i lati con lalbero di eucalipto
8584295 a sud dellisola c uno strato di roccia insolito e ho scoperto che se lo sottoponevo a una certa temperatura nella mia fornace si scioglieva in un metallo duttile e ho usato quello per fare gli arnesi

8584303 toch wel want het is ook een stuk over spijt meer zelfs het is een soort bezwering met woorden opdat het nooit zo ver zal komen
8584304 ik zou eerder zeggen dat mannen op de rand van een zenuwinzinking nooit ver weg zijn
8584305 over de aftakeling van een man die zich schandelijk gedraagt en die op het einde van zijn leven alles overziet en ziet dat het slecht was
8584306 de titel betekent dan ook zoiets als op het einde van mijn leven bezoek ik mijn herinneringen en daarna nooit meer maar in het nederlands klinkt dat zo goed niet en bovendien waarom zou jan fabre het alleenrecht moeten hebben op lange titels
8584307 als huldeblijk hebben we zelfs een sketch eruit letterlijk overgenomen want het stuk is niet zo zwaar op de hand als uit deze samenvatting zou blijken er is zeker plaats voor humor en ook de muziek speelt een belangrijke rol en dat is dan zowel lou reed als peter maffay

8584321 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8584322 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8584323 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8584324 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8584325 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8584332 de regisseur en de spelers hebben feilloos en met perfecte timing de essentie van het stuk geraakt zonder te verzanden in de overvloed van details in mijn origineel script
8584333 we spelen al in een tijdloos kader dan nog eens een open einde geven zou niets meer zijn dan jezelf herhalen
8584334 couldnt the perfect all knowing god come up with a better plan than this
8584335 kalau orang sudah benci kita baca quran pun masih salah
8584336 het is het 27ste stuk waarbij ik betrokken ben want rond 1981 zong ik live achter de sc ne enkele chileense liederen tijdens het stuk de langste nacht maar dat vergeet men meestal mee te tellen
8584337 mijn eerste optreden was in hautem nabij vilvoorde waar ik werd ontdekt door de vader van de vlaamse kleinkunst kor van der goten in 1968 trad ik op in grimbergen samen met o a zjef vanuytsel en lamp lazarus en kris die dus ook naam gemaakt hebben in dat wereldje wat eigenlijk wel een beetje vreemd is want als je de recensies van die avond erop naleest heeft men het in de pers vooral over mij
8584338 ze hebben nochtans muziekschool gevolgd maar ze hebben de feeling niet
8584339 wie durfde in die tijd alles op alles zetten als ik het nu nog eens zou kunnen overdoen dan zou ik een degelijke instrumentale opleiding volgen en het erop wagen maar het waren andere tijden toen nietwaar
8584340 ik volgde toen spaanse les bij willem van impe de legendarische leraar uit het gentse elk jaar tijdens de paasvakantie organiseerde hij voor zijn leerlingen een reis naar andalusi ik speelde en zong daar dan bij het kampvuur en zo werd ik opgemerkt door josiane rimbaut de echtgenote van provinciegouverneur herman balthazar die op dat moment trouwens als voorzitter nog altijd nauw betrokken was bij de multa spelen deed hij niet meer maar daarv r had hij het wel tweemaal gedaan ook burgemeester frank beke heeft trouwens nog bij ons gespeeld en de nieuwe schepen karen temmerman en jan moors en natuurlijk nic balthazar
8584341 ikzelf ben geen sper de meesten komen trouwens uit het vrij onderwijs maar ze zijn op een bepaald moment wel bekeerd want het dient wel gezegd dat we bij multatuli altijd stukken met inhoud spelen vrijblijvende billenkletsers das niks voor ons
8584342 het belang van ernst is w l een luchtige komedie al is en blijft het natuurlijk wel een stuk van oscar wilde in een vertaling van gerrit komrij zal het vooral een opeenvolging zijn van spirituele vondsten maar het volgende stuk zal dan toch weer ge ngageerd zijn want het is van vaclav havel
8584343 ik zou natuurlijk kunnen zeggen dat we hiermee de honderdste verjaardag van het overlijden van wilde willen herdenken maar om eerlijk te zijn is dat gewoon een gelukkig toeval nee we zaten met een stuk waarvoor negen mensen waren aangezocht waarvan een viertal nieuwelingen terwijl de anderen pas aan hun tweede of derde stuk toe waren die wilden dus erg graag allemaal nog eens spelen toen de regisseur dan plotseling afhaakte kwam iemand met dit stuk aandraven dat ook juist negen personages telde en ik werd aangeduid als regisseur
8584344 n wel nu ik die ervaring heb gehad maar dan wil ik wel degelijk zelf een stuk uitkiezen en er een eigen visie op uitwerken
8584345 iedereen kan sympathiseren met de tegenvallers van een vriend maar het vraagt een erg mooi karakter om hetzelfde te doen met iemands successen
8584346 theater de waanzin wil theater brengen waarbij het tegenover elkaar stellen van de begrippen waan en zin centraal staat waan in de betekenis van hoop verlangen en illusie illusie als theatrale metafoor bij uitstek maar ook als onverbrekelijke hoeksteen van het leven dat in die waan vaak zijn enige zin vindt
8584347 het is de bedoeling vooral internationaal te blijven werken maar nu we die eigen zaal hebben moeten we er wel in spelen tenslotte betalen we daarvoor toch 14 000fr huur per maand er is plaats voor 84 toeschouwers dat konden er meer geweest zijn maar gratis en voor niks hebben we de comfortabele zetels van theater arena op de kop kunnen tikken en dat is toch ook niet niks deze stoffen zetels zijn ge nstalleerd op houten pratikabels wat de brandweer eigenlijk niet zo graag zag maar als je betonnen gradins giet dan ben je al meteen beperkt in je mogelijkheden terwijl wij toch nog altijd de mogelijkheid willen openlaten om en rond te spelen of de toeschouwers mee te nemen van de ene hoek naar de andere enz

8584377 by all rights obama should be crushing mccain instead obama has seemed defensive and cautious the selection of delaware senator joe biden as running mate is best understood as an effort to play it safe to select a veteran legislator who is on record praising mccain and who voted for the iraq war meanwhile mccain is the candidate who is growing more confident and aggressive in my view what he needs to do now to secure a republican victory is to begin a revolution in republican thinking his party must become the defenders of the economic underdogs

8584412 jeremy came into camp in tremendous physical condition and for freshmen if they can come in and acclimate to the speed of practice and the speed we throw things at them mentally theyve got an opportunity to compete to contribute
8584413 what he was able to do was go out on the field and make some things happen early he got his confidence up and really started to make some plays
8584414 has been doing real unlike freshman things making big plays at key situations doing two minute drills scoring touchdowns third down conversions just all the things you look for in a wide receiver
8584415 we felt like from his football intelligence in high school being a quarterback being asked to run the football as much as he did at darby 2 692 career rushing yards being a multisport athlete a basketball player and a track athlete also we thought he was just a tremendous all around athlete

8584497 theres numerous cases we can talk about where people have been revived from cardiac arrest who have had to wait outside the hospital for up to an hour before they can actually be seen in the hospital
8584498 ramped outside emergency wards but he said the situation would only get worse
8584499 the community of queensland needs to realise this is not the ambulance drivers fault its queensland healths fault
8584500 thats fantastic thats a great effort but theyre not going to be any good if we cant get them to the jobs get them away from the hospitals
8584501 we provide a very professional standard of care but obviously thats limited to what were trained to do
8584502 these people need to go to the next level thats why we have doctors and nurses to extend the level of care
8584503 thats the other side of ramping while its uncomfortable and inconvenient for people sitting in the ambulance its absolutely risking their health and wellbeing by not receiving the level of care they deserve
8584504 theyre the ones receiving the triple 0 phone calls and theyre the ones who then have to make a decision where theyre going to get an ambulance from
8584505 in some ways communications staff are the unsung heroes of this whole process
8584506 very bad and the situation was becoming worse at brisbanes hospitals
8584507 united position of a summit of central asian nations would serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white

8584509 active role in resolving the conflict in georgia according to the draft of a joint statement released by the kremlin
8584510 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia said the statement from britain canada france germany italy japan and the united states
8584511 they had a frank exchange of views the spokeswoman for smith said
8584512 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began
8584513 they will live to regret it shevardnadze said in an interview in japans
8584514 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8584515 he has a big responsibility not to start one he added
8584516 certainly some measures of precaution are being taken said a spokesman for prime minister vladimir putin dmitry peskov
8584517 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8584518 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states peskov said
8584519 i think his speech was directed at other australian states and not at victoria john brumby said in melbourne
8584520 much further down that track than any of the other states
8584521 weve put in place a whole series of systems which provides comparative information on performance data and so on to parents mr carpenter said

8584524 mr rudd has the power now to withhold money from states that have not complied with this and the challenge for him is will he do so
8584525 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients
8584526 in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8584527 were happy with the verdict but its a shame this should have been limited to one death
8584528 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8584529 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8584530 i seen nothing but an evil empty cold hearted shell
8584531 in the wind the ashes fly the poison crown the charcoal ground he sang
8584532 the pumping of acid into the soil and aquifers will leave behind acid and radioactive wastes in some of the aquifers within the mine lease for many years mr noonan said
8584533 its actually causing greater environmental impact over a larger area
8584534 it is incredibly disappointing to see peter garrett of all people allowing such a thing to take place given the current state of water in australia and in south australia in particular senator ludlam said
8584535 it should be completely unacceptable in this day and age
8584536 i am satisfied that the tough conditions attached to this approval will ensure the highest standards of environmental management by the mine operator mr garrett said
8584537 my decision demonstrates the governments commitment to ensuring worlds best practice environmental standards for uranium mining in this country
8584538 the way in which heathgate resources manages mining fluids and the disposal of liquid wastes has been confirmed by the csiro and geoscience australia as worlds best practice and endorsed by the chief scientist mr garrett said
8584539 sanctions are being considered and many other means at next mondays meeting in brussels said kouchner whose country holds the european union presidency
8584540 we are trying to draw up a strong text showing our desire not to accept the situation in georgia he told reporters adding that he did not want to
8584541 i think his speech was directed at other australian states and not at victoria john brumby said in melbourne
8584542 much further down that track than any of the other states
8584543 weve put in place a whole series of systems which provides comparative information on performance data and so on to parents mr carpenter said

8584547 close tight knit group was hoping to go back tomorrow and use the memory of priestley to get through it she said
8584548 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy the spokeswoman said
8584549 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married the spokeswoman said
8584550 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight

8584555 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile

8584575 we didnt want to play any dirty tricks on a colleague paying the buy out clause on a player at a club like villarreal isnt our style with six or seven days to go to the end of the transfer window
8584576 we could have done it and the player would be here i spoke with the villarreal president and he told me they didnt want to sell and there it was left

8584604 going forward this particular industry is expected to grow at a very strong rate in india and globally their major market is in the uk they are expanding away from that market also into spain south africa singapore and malaysia we are expecting that also to drive growth in this particular business going forward they also may enter the us markets very shortly so we expect the company to maintain at least a 35 odd growth in earnings over the next two three years so we have a target of about rs 290 on that stock at the moment
8584605 reliance met the target of rs 2 120 and then the way it has cracked now it seems that the support area between rs 2 025 to about rs 1 980 might well be tested but i wasnt expecting it to move so low below rs 2 120 so if it is falling on good volumes then maybe the rs 2 020 to about rs 1 980 might well be tested but it maybe that a lot of bulls were taking positions and this series for reliance they are liquidating so we need to take a fresh view tomorrow as to how reliance reacts if it bounces back above rs 2 120 then chances are that we might actually see a recovery else the levels of rs 1 980 might well be tested

8584663 it was a rough summer because of president bush we are fighting wars and the whole economy is messed up and everyone is hurting he doesnt care about black people or the middle class
8584664 this summer was the best ever i had a wonderful week in ocean city md with my wife sons and in laws we stayed right on the boardwalk my boys ages 2 and 3 thought that was the cats meow we also went to kennywood sandcastle waterpark the pittsburgh zoo as well as the beach
8584665 i worked a lot and used public transportation gas prices are so high it was worse than most summers because i worked so much
8584666 i did nothing not because of the economy its just that we are always homebodies
8584667 i was busy planning my move from the san francisco bay area to pittsburgh and i was busy preparing for the classes i will teach this semester but i did take a trip to indonesia consulting for the asian development bank we were trying to help poor entrepreneurs in the small villages secure financing and expand their businesses the villages were hot the accommodations and food were pretty poor but i was blown away that a lot of indonesian businesses are women owned indonesians treat women better than most moslem countries women are considered equals and treated with courtesy and respect
8584668 we visited washington state and spent four days travelling along the west coast we also enjoyed five days in seattle the economy had no effect because we planned the trip before the economy went south i really enjoyed my summer i have a great job my two children were home from college all is well with them and they were both employed my husband was able to participate in weekend astronomy conventions
8584669 gas prices didnt affect me too much we pitt students have a bus pass but i needed to plan activities in advance around the port authority schedule
8584670 actually there is no location set yet where the ramp extension would access pennsylvania avenue the study should determine a recommendation
8584671 that study is linked to the proposed turnpike extension feasibility study
8584672 we approached penndot about doing the project they showed interest but would not pay for a feasibility study
8584673 a turnpike exit ramp accessing pennsylvania avenue definitely would impact traffic flowing through irwin motorists use main street and oak street as shortcuts to avoid route 30 traffic congestion to reach north irwin trafford route 993 and penn township
8584674 were thinking speed bumps and stop signs to slow traffic thats not enough to slow down the volume of traffic that would be generated by an extension its going to be a nightmare for our residents
8584675 the study should include recommendations to reduce traffic congestion on all roads in that area
8584676 i feel an extension of the west exit ramp would reduce turnpike traffic trying to access route 30 the traffic gridlock at rush hour is terrible and its getting worse
8584677 we just figured with the increase in boat traffic every year our 16 foot aluminum was not up to snuff
8584678 were just trying to make sure that everybodys safe thats all

8584682 residents often stop by to chat with emergency personnel on duty
8584683 the woman comes up and says you the chief i nodded yes
8584684 i said yes and accepted them i thanked her she nodded smiled and left the building her good deed for the day was done i guess
8584685 i couldnt help wondering though how did members of that church know our organization didnt have animal oxygen masks these masks will hook into oxygen bottles our ambulances carry
8584686 really weve answered emergency distress calls for dogs cats and even cattle we used oxygen masks designed for humans
8584687 once our unit got a frantic call that a male was in cardiac arrest thats all the dispatcher said our crew got there and found a crowd looking at a dog lying on the ground the animal was pretty far gone we tried to bring it back it died
8584688 maybe if we had an animal mask the result might have been happier
8584689 in this business you never know what youre going to face when youre called out now were prepared for anything even dogs
8584690 i needed to be certified in north huntingdon because of the township police k 9 units dogs
8584691 i feel a fair bipartisan process by this board found a manager who possesses the credentials and experience necessary to meet the growing demands of our rapidly growing municipality
8584692 jim morrisons mandate is to keep our municipality moving forward efficiently
8584693 north huntingdon has similar challenges i feel that murrysville faced when i worked there
8584694 its a really good progressive community with many opportunities my job will be to make sure those opportunities are not wasted
8584695 include working with people and developing a team with everybody pulling in the same direction that includes the commissioners administration staff and appointed boards
8584696 im fortunate to be joining a dedicated proven administrative staff
8584697 what theyve accomplished to make north huntingdon a desirable community to live in and one of the fastest growing municipalities in western pennsylvania i feel speaks for itself ill be depending on them
8584698 my plan is to ask everybody what are your goals and what direction do you want to take to accomplish them i will listen when residents speak out because they also have stake in the townships future
8584699 he sang he danced he acted he was phenomenally talented
8584700 what i respect about him is that he still credits his parents and teachers for his success
8584701 i guess my mom saw some musical talent in me
8584702 his advice was to do as much as i can until i cant anymore
8584703 everyone from mike myers on down was so approachable and it was the catalyst for a great learning experience
8584704 you could argue that daniel day lewis in there will be blood is an example of cross cultural casting
8584705 thats an irish guy playing a texan and winning an award for it
8584706 and theres pittsburghers everywhere in new york most of my closest friends are from there
8584707 its always really nice to come home if youre from pittsburgh theres a little bit of your heart that stays there
8584708 i just felt at that moment that i didnt make a difference
8584709 the combination of rapidly increasing costs for payroll and benefits for our police department is too much for us to handle right now
8584710 the heart and soul of a town are in its people
8584711 its not in its facilities its not in its police force or ambulance service
8584712 murrysville has the best storm water runoff ordinances in the entire county
8584713 were not only concerned about flooding export were concerned about flooding our own community
8584714 the reality of the situation is you dont have good baseline data for the pre development conditions
8584715 as near as i can tell theres no municipality in the state that has good baseline data for what these pre development conditions truly are

8584730 i didnt do anything this summer i will fly to tampa in the fall to visit my son but i booked the airfare during a sale if he didnt live there i would not be going anywhere just making short trips
8584731 i went to ocean city md with my family we drove so the gas was the worst part it was six hours from pittsburgh i havent gone on a family vacation for about 10 years so it made a great summer for me
8584732 it was just awful i took a bus to syracuse n y to work at a carnival then the carnival company didnt give me my final pay so a friend had to drive me home to pittsburgh
8584733 we went canoeing near dawson and we bought a house because of the bad real estate market we were able to get an excellent deal on our house

8584779 i grew up in swissvale and the police were more community oriented then
8584780 this is a first step in the right direction but there need to be more talks like this with the swissvale police department present

8584811 i keep telling any student who is going to be new to the school this year not to worry because everyone will be coming back to a new school no one will know their way around
8584812 through this renovation we had to keep the focus on instructional activities
8584813 with the new facilities and the test scores its a very exciting time in the district
8584814 originally we had the concept of doing a three or four story facade on the side of the under renovation denis theater that involved a trolley people walking
8584815 when they asked me to redesign it it was basically just the idea of doing the walking thing

8584818 we were talking about pittsburgh 250 and some of the highlights of pittsburgh and one of the things that was mentioned was phipps conservatory so i took inspirations from that
8584819 it kind of ties in with all of the businesses we talk about it being a little garden for the neighborhood
8584820 i cant tell you how many people have stopped in to tell us how much they like that mural
8584821 this was done without township county city or anyone elses money we did this all on our own and i think thats very important
8584822 the buildings in better shape now than when we started
8584823 the prep work probably took two weeks to get it solid but its worth the time to get it right because it adds length to the life of the artwork
8584824 kind of the fun part of doing this mural is that its in my neighborhood i hear people talking about it a few think a new business is going in there is it a garden shop or a travel agency opening up
8584825 we are classified as a sport and we treat participants as athletes
8584826 a lot of people dont realize the work that goes into it but its probably one of the hardest sports said ashley contristano 23 varsity cheerleading coach for keystone oaks school district
8584827 these girls are gymnasts and all their movements take tons of precision
8584828 they utilize most of the muscles in their body in doing stunts tumbling or dancing
8584829 they have to be in good physical shape to do all that they do
8584830 i cheered from the time i was in first or second grade and it was a huge part of my life growing up and a really positive experience
8584831 after college i wanted to be able to spend time giving back to the other girls
8584832 as the sport is constantly evolving with more difficult stunts it presents the girls with new challenges and something to work toward to experience that achievement
8584833 i really like being a part of not only cheerleading but in helping them grow into young leaders
8584834 i hope that all the girls are successful not only in cheerleading but in life and any assistance i can lend in that regard is readily given

8584837 he is taking an active interest in our community and that is important
8584838 he gets along well with borough workers and he has experience common sense and knows how to get things done just as importantly he knows he is the manager that is his job and the best thing i feel i can do is get out of the way and let him do his job
8584839 he has courage and you need that to set a true positive agenda for dormont
8584840 im taking a stay cation next month when were going to visit all the cultural spots in the burg places such as the sen john heinz history center the andy warhol the carnegie museum of art and the like we had planned to go to chautauqua an educational institute in southwestern new york state but the cost of gas for our type of vehicle put that trip on the back burner
8584841 the high cost of fuel most certainly factored into my familys summer activities we stayed closer to home our cars run on diesel fuel and as one knows it costs significantly more than gasoline
8584842 economically it certainly was a worse summer than normal as the cost of just about everything has skyrocketed but personally summer with my family was delightful no matter that we stayed close to home
8584843 i never fill up my gas tank anymore this year i loved being in my garden and spending time biking on the montour and youghiogheny trails
8584844 i spent time and money to travel for a month in india this summer my dollar went further there the u s dollar is worth about 44 indian rupees even though the dollar is down overseas against the euro things are still affordable in india
8584845 i golfed a lot and hung out with friends the economy didnt interfere with that it was a summer like any other
8584846 the economy didnt necessary affect me i was just too busy to vacation this year we added an extra dining room in the restaurant and that kept me very busy if you give people good service and good value they will continue to frequent your restaurant
8584847 strains on the economy mean that people tip less it also hit me when i flew to the jersey shore and my plane ticket was more than usual and the airlines also charged me 15 for a bag
8584848 i traveled only once to lancaster county to visit my grandchildren in previous years i would have gone five times over the summer but the cost of gas has really impacted me
8584849 also the cost of pet care has really gone up
8584850 it was the worst summer ever both my parents lost their jobs i stayed home and hung out with friends still we went to the pool and kennywood
8584851 i just returned from toronto canada this morning a friend was driving there so i tagged along it was fun we met up with his family and friends for barbecues
8584852 i took a trip to baltimore with friends we split the costs of gas and hotel i made do with the situation so the summer was fine
8584853 we are proud to have played an important part in taking team csc from fourteenth to first in the team world ranking and in carlos sastres tour de france victory
8584854 it was the dedication to excellence by both the equipment sponsors and the team that made it happen most of all we appreciate the confidence bjarne riis had in us back in 2002 and thank him for these past six years the financial realities of pro cycling today have caused a change in priorities for the team and we respect that our main reason to work with a team is to develop new products and how better to accomplish that than by owning the team
8584855 cervelo testteam will race as a professional cycling team with a continental pro standing

8584857 as a partner of the womens team we have seen their very high level of professionalism and their impressive results

8584864 software companies such as fyi corporation are gaining significant competitive advantages by relying on cynergy to redesign and redevelop existing applications using rias its indisputable that users engage with rias more readily and intently which will result in high productivity and better roi for fyi corporations customers
8584865 when we decided to redesign our flagship product we looked long and hard at a list of blue chip developers and cynergy rose to the top of that list
8584866 we have been very impressed with their capabilities and commitment to our best interests theyve helped create a market centric version of fyi visual that is flexible adaptive and differentiates us from other solutions providers
8584867 it was a big game for us and i felt we were well organised disciplined focused and basically never really under threat from fc twente what was most important was not to make mistakes be patient and score our goals
8584868 i felt the whole team was sharper and physically we were much better than on saturday afternoon maybe that is why we made it easier it was a game that gave us the same problem as in the first game by man marking us all over the pitch when they had the ball they didnt take many risks they were more focused on possession we had to be well organised because they played a little bit with our patience
8584869 i believe he brings calm and confidence to the side and overall we had a good balance in the side he could have stayed on he was more disappointed twente didnt really have a go at us he likes to play he wants always to play but i took him off because he has just come back from a hamstring and we play again on saturday recovery time will be very short
8584870 the response was clear it was togetherness it was consistency and that is what you want on a night like that we want to play with the best and to do that means qualifying for the group stage there was so much at stake tonight that of course it was a big mental test
8584871 we have been struggling a little bit for goals but i was never really worried about that because we can create chances it is difficult when you start the season with a qualifier and in between you have an international friendly at that moment the bodies arent completely ready to absorb all that and you can have a dip a little bit i felt that on saturday
8584872 he had a stomach bug during the game and was sick at half time he couldnt go on
8584873 i feel you have to be patient with theo i always say that

8584880 from a surgical point of view the overwhelming reason for change is to improve the quality of service for patients
8584881 trusts around us are concentrating acute emergency services in surgery and trauma and orthopaedics on one site to improve the patient experience and the quality of care they receive
8584882 similarly if we concentrate planned services we can again provide a better quality of service for our patients if we dont reconfigure we will fall even further behind neighbouring trusts who have already reconfigured these services to the benefit of their patients
8584883 centralising services will not see the demise of any of our hospitals but it will provide our patients with better access to a greater level of expertise and experience
8584884 maidstones a amp e department will continue to be consultant led and will continue to see the vast majority of patients it sees now
8584885 we share the same biology regardless of ideology believe me when i say to you i hope the russians love their children too
8584886 bond went into limbo for seven years for many reasons but one was that it didnt feel relevant any more

8584888 films take a while to get on the screen i dont think we will see anything for a year

8584939 its unacceptable that in every major issue of our time we are going backwards not forwards
8584940 i never needed his help to make plates out of these greenskins heads
8584941 owmaigawd warhamerm is on empty v look at teh trailers plox
8584942 the people behind me are crucial to the future of this country
8584943 why do we need 60 democrats why is reid the first senate majority leader to say we need 60 votes rather than a majority to get things done
8584944 in 2005 when republicans had a majority they stopped democratic filibusters why cant you do the same now
8584945 they have a story line but i want us to all shout loud and clear so the press can hear it we are united behind obama
8584946 its unacceptable that in every major issue of our time we are going backwards not forwards
8584947 the people behind me are crucial to the future of this country
8584948 why do we need 60 democrats why is reid the first senate majority leader to say we need 60 votes rather than a majority to get things done
8584949 in 2005 when republicans had a majority they stopped democratic filibusters why cant you do the same now
8584950 they have a story line but i want us to all shout loud and clear so the press can hear it we are united behind obama
8584951 its unacceptable that in every major issue of our time we are going backwards not forwards
8584952 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
8584953 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
8584954 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
8584955 if you hear the dogs keep going if you see the torches in the woods keep going if theyre shouting after you keep going dont ever stop keep going
8584956 remember before we can keep going weve got to get going by electing barack obama the next president of the united states
8584957 when the democratic primary process is over and hillary tells me both privately and publicly that this is a time to come together and we have to do everything we can to help barack obama i take that as a moral imperative
8584958 because i really believe in the values of the democratic party
8584959 theres a coming together process thats not yet complete theyre still in a mourning period
8584960 the clintons have been very popular in the jewish community
8584961 the jewish community especially those of us who are democrats understands that this is probably the most important election in their lifetime and people are coming together to support barack obama
8584962 the effort to bring the democrats and particularly jewish democrats together is coming along very successfully
8584963 we reminded them that their sole responsibility in denver is selecting the electable candidate
8584964 he will be fine its not life threatening or anything like that but he does have some broken bones and hes stable
8584965 the crash was on the m1 around the leicester nottingham area and while it was a bad crash in the grand scheme of things its very mendable

8584970 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
8584971 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
8584972 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
8584973 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
8584974 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
8584975 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
8584976 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
8584977 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
8584978 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
8584979 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
8584980 its weird to like fake sex and put your parts up against someone elses
8584981 i know that if i ever smoked pot i would probably become like a total pothead because i think i would like that
8584982 i have like a chill personality so thats why im never going to start because i dont like to be dependent on anything i dont even drink coffee
8584983 i would have a very different career right now and im happy where im at
8584984 i was like all right man im ready i was eager that was great because i just sort of was fueled you know
8584985 she came up to my dressing room and she was crying and she was like im so proud of you
8584986 i dont get showtime so i dont have any great reference for him and so when he came in to see us last november we couldnt believe that there was this guy who was so charismatic and such a good actor and then when he opened his mouth and sang for us all the little hairs on our arms stood up
8584987 i feel like we just had a very fortuitous moment just the right person the right time the right part
8584988 he has a very empathetic spirit and it allows him to climb into the character from the inside out and in a kind of complete and authentic way hes so big hearted as a person that he can stand at the center of the story and the audience wants to climb in with him and thats such a gift
8584989 but they definitely put you in a box and my parents were very lenient and very open minded and let me explore for myself what i felt was right and wrong and they raised all their kids that way and none of us have problems with alcohol or drugs
8584990 silas is totally opposite of me and also not as smart as melchior
8584991 so silas is like the stupid version of not being me and melchior is like the smart intellectual version of not being me but i like doing that i like being able to play roles that are totally different from me
8584992 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclimation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8584993 i think its good for america in general not just the african american community but i think the entire nation
8584994 i think it shows that someone from a different background will be then seen to rise to become possibly president of the united states
8584995 i think african american children looking at him this is the moment where they think ok well maybe i have a chance to become president in the future also
8584996 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
8584997 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8584998 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8584999 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8585000 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8585001 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
8585002 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
8585003 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
8585004 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
8585005 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
8585006 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
8585007 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
8585008 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
8585009 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
8585010 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
8585011 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
8585012 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
8585013 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
8585014 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
8585015 no but i was worried about getting my dress really dirty
8585016 i would like to take a nap i was exhausted
8585017 i was lucky after i finished i went to jog a little on the treadmill we do that to get all the lactic acid from your muscles and feel better after three minutes i cramped couldnt bend my leg i couldnt have finished the match the ideal is to run 10 minutes after a match that long
8585018 i was down 1 5 in the third set to her at key biscayne
8585019 and saved five match points then i got to the final maybe this win was a good omen
8585020 if shes angry at me for going down these things happen in a match we try our best to win the match and a win is the most important thing
8585021 i hope i can get into the second week its mental as much as physical it all needs work
8585022 i was no 1 in the world by doing that i achieved one huge goal in my career in my life and its something amazing i would love to come back to that position but i need to lift my level im trying real hard but because i had so many injuries i had a tough time
8585023 experiments in high tech edutainment engaging students in a media rich popular culture course
8585024 generic intellectual abilities and a broad understanding of the world
8585025 ensure that we can respond to the needs of different offenders whilst capturing the best of what we do and the economies of scale available to us
8585026 flying in the face of our and others evidence that smaller prisons work better than large ones
8585027 they may be more efficient but at the cost of being less effective
8585028 millions of americans suffer from problem or pathological gambling that can destroy families we support legislation prohibiting gambling over the internet or in student athletics by student athletes who are participating in competitive sports
8585029 internet gambling represents the most invasive and addictive form of gambling in our history
8585030 i call people successful not because they have money or their business is doing well but because as human beings they have a fully developed sense of being alive and are engaged in a lifetime task of collaboration with other human beings their mothers and fathers their family their friends their loved ones the friends who are dying the friends who are being born success dont you know it is all about being able to extend love to people really not in a big capital letter sense but in the everyday little by little task by task gesture by gesture word by word

8585039 kita lihat aja dari bayi mereka uda dididik ke mall apalagi orang tua sekarang udah banyak yang kerja jadi tidak ada edukasi yang maksimal itu merupakan satu dari banyak faktor mengapa mereka konsumtif

8585050 saya sangat bersyukur ternyata banyak pihak yang turut membantu dalam masalah pendidikan anak seperti di sini meskipun non formal tapi tetap mendidik anak sambil bermain

8585326 the survey underlined that people have strong opinions on green issues and theres good evidence of green behaviour in the uk the danger is that we overestimate how good the state of the uks own environment is and become complacent in our efforts to become greener messages about some basic but effective actions for example recycling have been understood and we are willing to accommodate these in our lifestyles but with our negative view of the environment globally we should recognise our responsibility to do whatever we can and be open to a wider range of green behaviours in order to reduce our impact on the environment as much as possible

8585340 we have struggled to cultivate our lands having struggled with the tigers and the elephants despite not having an education and cultivated these lands and when it was time to reap the harvest these miserable farmers were killed and we are unable to go to our lands the government has said they will provide protection but they have provided guns to only a few farmers at okkampitiya it is difficult to look on while the land we cultivated for our food is destroyed in this manner
8585341 after bus bombing in buttala the tigers came to our chena they killed my elder brother and all those who died are my relations the police did not come to even bring the corpses and my younger brother only did this we live by these cultivations and this time we were blessed with a good harvest the tigers are still roaming near the mountains and pluck the maize which weve cultivated

8585343 our second quarter results reflect the continued effects of a slowing economy which contributed to the earnings declines we have experienced since the third quarter of 2007
8585344 while it was a difficult quarter we were successful in reducing our domestic inventory levels by 500 million which should lead to lower markdowns and favorably impact our gross margin rates in the second half of the year
8585345 we expect to generate higher ebitda in the second half of this year as compared to the corresponding period in 2007 as we benefit from our lower domestic inventory levels and continued vigilant expense management given our year to date results and the state of the economy our current full year ebitda forecast which assumes flat to modest comparable store sales declines for the rest of the year is comparable to but no longer exceeds last years ebitda

8585466 the arrival of the w302 should come as no surprise since its all another attempt on sony ericssons part to bring the walkman range into the mainstream with an affordable solution that will dominate on the market with its light price tag but the w302 is actually a bit of a mixed bag while they had to keep its price within certain brackets they also borrowed the design from already announced top tier offerings such as the sony ericsson w880i and sony ericsson w890i
8585467 to say that the w980 will be a mass market device would be a daring prediction its not even about its music player or audio quality the real reason is that sony ericssons music savvy flagships have never been particularly popular bar this first member on top of that the w980 is not the cheapest phone around which leads us to believe it will follow in the footsteps of the sony ericsson w900i

8585575 women are very prone to this distortion because they see their bodies as a set of individual parts to be judged
8585576 the fact that celebrity culture has women focusing on these unrealistic images picking at parts that are airbrushed and therefore look good is sad

8585689 muitos estudos mostram que um senso de humor sexualmente atraente especialmente para as mulheres mas n s descobrimos que o humor auto depreciativo o mais atraente de todos
8585690 a nossa teoria que os indiv duos com um status elevado podem se permitir tirar sarro de si mesmos mais facilmente
8585691 por isso o uso de humor autodepreciativo por pessoas de status considerado baixo pode ser contraprodutivo sugerindo depress o derrotismo subordina o baixa auto estima
8585692 por outro lado se um indiv duo atingiu um status elevado ele provavelmente n o ter n veis realmente baixos de extrovers o e estabilidade emocional e devem mostrar suavidade suficiente para fazer amigos ou conquistar apoio
8585693 al m disso o uso de humor que deprecia os outros por indiv duos de status elevado pode ser visto como uma zombaria injusta e portanto menos atraente
8585694 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8585695 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8585696 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8585697 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8585698 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8585712 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
8585713 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
8585714 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
8585715 in every society there is a substantial gap between the life expectancy of the children of the most affluent and privileged and those who are born into deprivation but some countries are better than others at closing the gap
8585716 a boy in the suburb of calton glasgow can expect to live 28 years less than one raised in lenzie a few miles away one born in hampstead london will live around 11 years longer than a boy from st pancras five stops away on the northern line of the underground
8585717 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8585718 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8585719 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8585720 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8585721 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8585722 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8585723 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8585724 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8585725 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8585726 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8585727 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8585728 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8585729 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8585730 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8585731 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8585732 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

8585735 clintons deputy national policy director jake sullivan outlined several irish policies that would be undertaken in a clinton white house come 2009 he said clinton would immediately appoint an american special envoy on ireland who would maintain an office in the white house and report directly to the president clinton would also firmly focus on economic development in northern ireland sullivan said and have her secretary of commerce and other government agencies get involved in developing strategies for ireland
8585736 in the observer alan ruddock begins his account with the morning of september 11 the day of the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in new york as the us special envoy to ireland richard haas was preparing for a meeting with sinn fein leader gerry adams
8585737 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8585738 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned
8585739 anyone who omits one step in that sequence of values is falsifying the situation
8585740 605 000 long term immigrants arriving in the year to mid 2007 the eu projections show that the wave of migration to britain boosting both the workforce and fertility rates is out of step with many other european countries where deaths are expected to overtake births after 2015
8585741 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent
8585742 the uk population reached 60 5 million this year and the new official figures suggest it will rise to 65 million by 2016 and 71 million by 2031

8585746 this is not a game this is not fun what weve seen tonight is actually attempted murder please stop it now before someone is killed
8585747 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8585748 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

8585753 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border

8585882 i am writing to follow up on recent serious allegations regarding the creation of a false letter from tahir jalil habbush saddam husseins former chief of intelligence to saddam hussein
8585883 the letter which was allegedly backdated to july 1 2001 attempted to establish an operational link between al qaeda and saddam hussein in the period before the 9 11 attacks by specifically stating that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had received training in iraq
8585884 at the time of the alleged decision in 2003 to concoct the false letter the vice presidents office had been reportedly pressuring the cia to prove this connection as a justification to invade iraq
8585885 upon careful review of the allegations concerning this matter i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
8585886 the law specifically provides that no covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media

8585896 it is disgraceful that border patrol agents are put in harms way and our government doesnt do everything reasonably within its power to protect us from marauding mexican soldiers and others
8585897 without a forceful response to these illegal incursions an agent will eventually be seriously wounded or killed it is only a matter of time
8585898 the incursions will not stop until the mexican military units and their commanders are held accountable for their actions
8585899 it is a documented fact that the mexican military is corrupt and is involved in protecting drug cartels smugglers and other criminals
8585900 there is an international boundary for a reason and they are to be respected by both governments
8585901 we take very seriously our role in working with our international neighbors to address and resolve these situations
8585902 the fact that the mexican military is operating in such close proximity to the border without any identifiable purpose calls into question its activities and raises concerns about the vulnerability of our southern land border
8585903 when considering the frequency of incursions and the threat these encounters pose to our border patrol agents it is critical that we take the necessary steps to ensure that mexican military and law enforcement personnel do not cross into the u s without our knowledge or consent
8585904 will result in a clearer delineation of the international border
8585905 a reasonable person would conclude that the soldiers knew exactly at whom they were pointing their rifles
8585906 had the agent panicked and fired a shot or attempted to flee in his vehicle there is little doubt the mexican soldiers would have opened fire
8585907 during past incursions the mexican government has denied it had soldiers in the area they have blamed impostors even when military humvees were involved
8585908 time after time they have gotten away with these incursions and time after time our government has not taken a forceful stand against them
8585909 to address the incursion and limit or prevent the likelihood of similar incidents in the future

8585941 spiritual growth is a conundrum the key to spiritual growth is developing healthy and holy routines we call them spiritual disciplines but once the routine becomes routine we need to disrupt it why because sacred routines become empty rituals when we do them out of left brain memory instead of right brain imagination good routines become bad routines if we dont change the routine one of the greatest dangers we face spiritually is learning how and forgetting why call it familiarization call it habituation call it routinization call it what you want when we learn how and forget why we start going through the motions spiritually

8586136 der vorschlag von frau von der leyen ist kontraproduktiv weil er die chancengleichheit unter den krankenkassen aush hlt
8586137 das bisherige system krankt doch daran dass die kassen nur noch darum konkurrieren wer die meisten jungen gesunden patienten hat wer jetzt zum kassenwechsel aus rein finanziellen motiven aufruft f rdert diesen ungesunden wettbewerb noch was wir brauchen ist ein gesunder wettbewerb um die beste versorgung der patienten
8586138 nur empfehlen schauen sie ihrer krankenkasse genau auf die finger und wechseln sie die kasse wenn sie mehr geld von ihnen verlangt die auswahl ist gro genug
8586139 jede kasse bekommt denselben betrag pro versicherten damit h rt die jagd nach den jungen besserverdienenden auf und jede kasse kann zeigen was sie mit dem geld ihrer versicherten macht

8586178 that said we might find something new and compelling about the antarctic setting that wants us to make the next game there but honestly were still at the preliminary stages
8586179 yes i put everything in the cut sequences which i kind of regret to some extent
8586180 maybe there is a new approach i should think about
8586181 if i make multiple storylines and allow the users to select which story this might really sacrifice the deep emotion the user might feel
8586182 when theres a concrete storyline and you kind of go along that rail you feel the destiny of the story which at the end makes you feel more moved
8586183 but when you make it interactive if you want multiple stories where you go one way or another will that make the player more moved when he or she finishes the game these two points are really the key which i am thinking about and if this works i think i could probably introduce a more interactive storytelling method

8586199 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8586200 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8586201 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8586202 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8586203 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8586204 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8586205 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8586206 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8586207 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8586208 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8586209 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8586210 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8586211 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

8586238 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8586239 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8586240 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8586241 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8586242 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8586243 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8586244 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8586245 who are open to doing something on the production side
8586246 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8586247 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8586248 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8586249 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8586250 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8586251 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8586252 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8586253 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8586254 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8586255 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8586256 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8586260 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8586261 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8586262 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8586263 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8586264 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8586265 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8586266 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8586267 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

8586280 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8586281 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8586282 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8586283 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8586284 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8586285 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8586286 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8586287 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8586288 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8586289 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8586290 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8586291 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8586292 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8586293 the effect of offshoring it jobs has been double edged pay rates have been pegged back but job creation at the entry level has not dried up as was mooted by some commentators
8586294 offshoring has made organisations it functions more efficient which has freed up budgets for investment elsewhere these new projects require support teams and its not always appropriate or advantageous to base these staff offshore
8586295 there is some debate as to whether offshoring has peaked wage inflation and the cost of co ordinating teams across international time zones is starting to unravel the economic case for outsourcing organisations may not be repatriating jobs en masse but when new jobs are created the uk is becoming a viable location once again
8586296 we are talking about fewer new jobs here not mass redundancies so there is no sense of a return to the post dot com market when huge numbers of contractors were laid off but where there is a less clear cut business case some it projects are being put on the back burner and that is leading to a softening in demand for some management and software development roles
8586297 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

8586300 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8586301 our manufacturing operations in asia have been running at capacity to satisfy demand in china
8586302 our outlook for sales and revenues this year still reflects another record year of growth in sales and revenues to caterpillar and for that matter for earnings
8586303 what is particularly impressive is that we have been able to sustain growth and strong earnings in the face of very severe recessionary conditions in our domestic market in the united states
8586304 we have not seen customers cancel orders to ask to postpone deliveries
8586305 this is the reality we are facing our concern is that consumers buying power is decreasing
8586306 our members and retirees have earned a fair and equitable contract through years of hard work sacrifice and uncertainty
8586307 the company and union have reached tentative agreements on many of the outstanding issues but continue negotiating on a handful of topics

8586387 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8586388 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8586389 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

8586400 women tend to worry about their safety at night more and want better lighting in public spaces others find pavements difficult for buggies
8586401 footpaths shouldnt be backed onto by high walls and fences they shouldnt be designed so they create blind corners
8586402 urban designers like to be fluid and creative but the reality is women want to get from one point to another as quickly as possible
8586403 there is an emphasis on great swathes of grass for playing fields on which men play games women want more parks near to their homes with things like duck ponds and plants
8586404 its a fundamental thing if people are out and want to go theyre stuck its the missing link

8586412 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
8586413 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability
8586414 the cooperation between the relevant oil companies from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8586415 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8586416 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realised this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals
8586417 since it has become more and more difficult to obtain equity and exploit rights in oil fields its good for china to participate in the development through a service contract it diversifies our oil sources and helps guarantee chinas oil supplies
8586418 our solid second quarter operating results reflect the ongoing success of our merchandising strategies and excellent execution across the board from our team given our positive momentum strong positioning in the marketplace and easier comparisons which continue through the second half of the year we are optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year although we remain mindful of the uncertain economic environment accordingly we have modestly raised our expectations for the balance of the year
8586419 net sales in the journeys group grew 9 from the prior year period to 161 million
8586420 net sales in the hat world group increased 13 from the prior year period to approximately 102 million and same store sales increased 7 in the second quarter with urban stores up 9 and non urban stores up 6
8586421 net sales for the underground station group which includes the remaining jarman stores were 24 million for the second quarter
8586422 johnston amp murphy groups net sales were approximately 44 million with wholesale sales down 9 from the prior year period and same store sales for the johnston amp murphy shops declined 3 from the prior year period
8586423 second quarter sales of licensed brands increased 16 from the prior year period to approximately 22 million the dockers r footwear business remains solid across all of its channels of distribution with particular strength in the specialty shoe retail chains
8586424 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
8586425 with the cash generated from the sale of mergent and kinetic we can now buy back almost half of our outstanding bond issue reducing our debt and significantly lowering our interest expense burden
8586426 we continue to focus on streamlining our operations and implementing cost cutting measures to improve profitability and efficiency
8586427 we are pleased with the initial steps we have taken following our strategic review of the business we believe that the sale of mergent and kinetic and the repayment of debt will position us for improved financial flexibility and enable management to concentrate on the china market our core competency
8586428 the broadband isp business was the final legacy of the old gigamedia a non core asset we are happy to dispose of
8586429 this disposal will allow us to allocate management resources and capital to our core entertainment businesses and accelerate growth
8586430 in our terms it would be like the mona lisa being taken out of the louvre in paris or the uffizi gallery in florence losing its botticellis
8586431 we have continued to cut costs and improve the responsiveness of our operations
8586432 unfortunately the rapid and accelerating decline of sales in the motor home industry during the first quarter caused heavy operating losses that were exacerbated by an aggressive discounting environment and downtime at our plants while the travel trailer division also had a loss quarter its performance was improved over the prior year the housing group remained profitable despite the challenging environment in that industry
8586433 we are experiencing some of the toughest industry conditions that we have seen since the late 1970s and early 1980s
8586434 dealers are reducing their inventories significantly and manufacturers orders are considerably below the dealers weak retail sales rates considering the current business climate we are pleased with the turnout indicated for our rv national dealer meeting next week we will be showcasing our newest products with innovative floor plans and exciting decor packages although we expect dealers to remain cautious for the foreseeable future we are eager to demonstrate to them why fleetwood remains an excellent choice as their business partner going forward
8586435 we believe that once the excess inventory of site built housing begins to clear the prospects for manufactured housing should improve
8586436 also the housing bill recently passed by congress contains several positives for our industry which should continue to narrow the gap between site built and manufactured housing lending practices we expect the difficult environment to continue for at least a couple more quarters however as shipments continue to lag throughout the country particularly in the retirement states of california arizona and florida in the meantime our trendsetter modular division has substantially completed two military contracts at fort bliss and fort sill and is in advanced stages of negotiations for additional similar contracts we have received positive feedback on our involvement to date and we expect to continue to participate in the armys military housing renovation plans
8586437 business conditions are expected to remain challenging at least through our third fiscal quarter resulting in losses and negative operating cash flows for fleetwood through that same period
8586438 we continue to aggressively pursue cost reductions and carefully manage production and inventories while still investing in new and improved products based on customer feedback
8586439 despite a modest but unavoidable build up of motor home chassis and finished goods inventories in the first quarter cash and marketable investments totaled 85 7 million at july 27 2008 with virtually no borrowings on our revolving credit facility
8586440 since then we have raised an additional 26 5 million from real estate financing a successful refinancing of the 5 debentures is the next step in our strategy to put fleetwood in a position of strength relative to current economic conditions and posture the company for an advantageous future we believe in the long term strength and viability of both our industries and look forward to continuing our participation as a leader in each as the markets recover
8586441 really wanted to capture the heart and soul of detroit
8586442 in the event that conditions worsen beyond our forecast the regulator could lower the excess requirement further such that the
8586443 our retail businesses in both canada and the u s led the way for us again this quarter delivering over 1 billion in combined net income
8586444 our strategy is delivering steady performance in tough market conditions while allowing us to continue investing in future growth
8586445 our td canada trust franchise achieved a record quarter in volume growth customer satisfaction levels and efficiency these very strong results were delivered while we continued to invest in the business opening 11 new branches and supporting our longer hours strategy
8586446 we are certainly feeling good about these results and our position as the leader in service and convenience in banking which was highlighted by tdcts winning of the j d power customer satisfaction award for the third year in a row
8586447 we are pleased with how the investments weve made in our wealth management platform are positioning us for future growth
8586448 as we expand our u s wealth business we look forward to taking advantage of our diversified offering to become the number one wealth management provider to td bank customers
8586449 were very pleased to see our u s personal and commercial operations coming together as planned exceeding our earnings expectations and creating a first rate u s franchise that is positioned to grow organically and deliver long term value to td shareholders
8586450 we expect the quality of td banks loan portfolio will continue to set us apart as we operate in a challenging environment
8586451 this was a tough quarter for our wholesale bank the mispricing that occurred is particularly disappointing and not consistent with our strong risk management culture were continuing to work on a thorough review of our risk practices across the organization to ensure we minimise the risk of this kind of thing happening again
8586452 looking forward td securities remains focused on producing high quality earnings and solidifying its position as a top three dealer in canada
8586453 our retail businesses on both sides of the border which again produced more than 90 of our earnings this quarter continued to perform very well providing td with a solid base of consistent earnings
8586454 in what continues to be a tough environment for banks were showing our strategy is working
8586455 our commitment to growth is reflected in the increase to our dividend weve said all along that our dividend will grow in line with our earnings over the medium term the increase this quarter demonstrates the boards confidence in the strength and stability of our earnings as we head into 2009
8586456 international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards a revised framework
8586457 our manufacturing operations in asia have been running at capacity to satisfy demand in china
8586458 our outlook for sales and revenues this year still reflects another record year of growth in sales and revenues to caterpillar and for that matter for earnings
8586459 what is particularly impressive is that we have been able to sustain growth and strong earnings in the face of very severe recessionary conditions in our domestic market in the united states
8586460 we have not seen customers cancel orders to ask to postpone deliveries

8586482 tinelli and his people did a great job to persuade me when they contacted me and the people who manage my interests
8586483 he sold me on the project he told me a lot of things about the team the coach their desire to be champions and to play in the copa libertadores
8586484 i had better offers from different clubs but san lorenzos was the best for my family and the sporting challenge
8586485 i feel i can play 80 minutes but the answer will come on the field the truth is that i didnt play too much last season so this is another part of the challenge
8586486 neither one of us would be covered by his health policy
8586487 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8586488 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8586489 so instead of producing worthless statistics that people fling around in vacuous editorials and pointless debates the census bureau should produce meaningful numbers identifying all of the sources of funds people will draw on if they need medical care

8586493 four more years of the same out of touch policies that created an economic disaster at home a disastrous foreign policy abroad four more years of the same divisive politics thats all about tearing people down instead of lifting the country up
8586494 we cant afford four more years of a government that does nothing while they watch the housing market collapse
8586495 the new law one of the most far reaching on housing in decades marks the centerpiece of washingtons efforts to address the nations housing meltdown
8586496 cant afford four more years of non energy policy written by and for the oil companies
8586497 we cant afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrificed our moral standing around the world
8586498 while i was opposing the credit card industrys bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to climb out of debt mccain was supporting it
8586499 and he even opposed helping families who were only in bankruptcy because of medical bills they couldnt pay
8586500 tilting the playing field against those debtors who genuinely turn to bankruptcy for a fresh start
8586501 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8586502 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8586503 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8586504 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8586505 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8586506 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8586507 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need

8586517 how long will you say these things and the words of your mouth be a mighty wind does god pervert justice or does the almighty pervert what is right if your sons sinned against him then he delivered them into the power of their transgression if you would seek god and implore the compassion of the almighty if you are pure and upright surely now he would rouse himself for you and restore your righteous estate though your beginning was insignificant yet your end will increase greatly

8586519 however the people of pakistan have a legitimate question to put to zardari who if elected as the president will become the symbol of the federation of pakistan about the source of his 60 million that was released by the swiss authorities after the withdrawal of the money laundering case against him from a swiss court
8586520 just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8586521 everything ive learned in my eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8586522 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8586523 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it and change it is exactly what barack obama will do
8586524 as oil companies post the biggest profits in history nearly half a trillion dollars in the last five years john wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks thats not change thats the same
8586525 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our next president
8586526 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for

8586541 i felt like he was really unifying us with his speech all of us
8586542 they said he was too young too experienced but president clinton asked us if that sounded like something wed heard before

8586559 woot today i get to be among the very first to share with you the planets newest camera the much anticipated nikon d90 you may have been attuned to all the recent leaks buzz and rumors of a new nikon camera coming soon but i can assure you this here aint no rumor
8586560 almost exactly two years after the d80 was announced comes its replacement the rather predictably named d90 the d80 has been one of nikons quiet successes and even today despite being positively methuselah like in digital camera terms it continues to sell and often makes its way into our top 10 most clicked on cameras because it looks so similar to the d80 the d90 appears at first glance to be one of those rather subdued incremental upgrades but dig a little deeper and youll find theres plenty to keep nikon fans happy

8586604 ppi does tend to be volatile but that its this high is shocking we knew it was going to go up but it is still fairly surprising and well above consensus
8586605 it will give the markets a dose of reality because pipeline pressures remain strong and although we do anticipate inflation will trend lower throughout 2009 perhaps investors need to rethink their trajectory
8586606 however unexpected additional price pressures were also recorded from a broad range of other items
8586607 we expect no more interest rate moves this year the sharp drop in the level of consumer inflation in 2009 due to the planned re weighting and changes in items surveyed is likely to cause the sarb to cut interest rates significantly beginning with a 50bp easing at the april 2009 mpc meeting
8586608 while there are going to be decreases in certain prices like fuel there are still underlying inflationary pressures the increases in the electricity prices are still going to be felt and we cannot expect inflation to drop immediately
8586609 i believe that the outlook for interest rates is that there may be room to lower them slightly but there wont be a dramatic fall in interest rates in the next 12 to 18 month period
8586610 it looks as though the hurricane is on track to inflicting damage

8586623 ive said many times that im an unselfish player dont judge my game purely on my goals judge it on goals assists and how i help the team play thats the way my game is
8586624 everyones talking about how i should score more goals but we won the premier league and champions league last season so if that happened again id be delighted ive got no problem at the minute
8586625 theres talk about bringing another forward in and hopefully we can do that to strengthen the team to help us spread it out but if a forward doesnt come in im sure we can deal with that
8586626 it was an interesting offer but my priority was to remain with getafe out of respect for many things the fans and the club who gave me the opportunity to play in the primera
8586627 the financial offer from the team that wanted me was extremely interesting three times my salary but i left it up to getafe they turned it down so ill continue working as usual
8586628 i have a two year contract here and i intend to fulfill it
8586629 i think it was an offer that could have benefitted both of us but im not a player whos said he wants to leave because that isnt the case
8586630 they had to accept or reject it and in this case it was rejected here i am but with all the excitement in the world
8586631 the game against sporting on sunday will be tough theyll be extremely excited at coming back up and its at their ground
8586632 its a pretty complicated game i imagine that their players and fans alike will be crazy we must be very focused
8586633 we spoke after the game and we cannot be happy with this performance it was a disastrous result we know as players we have let ourselves down as well as the manager gary megson the staff and the fans
8586634 this was a massive chance for us to go on and do something outside the premier league and maybe get into europe but it was not to be and now all our attention will have to be on the league
8586635 juventus are obviously a much bigger club both in italy and worldwide so hopefully it will be a step up
8586636 we will probably be dominating more games compared to aston villa in england so it will be different in that sense
8586637 its tough well come up against ac milan and inter but hopefully we will be up there battling for the scudetto
8586638 weve had quite a lot of tough games in pre season which has been good weve done well overall and had a good start in the champions league as well

8586643 statins were found to be beneficial drugs patients who used statins before a heart attack and continued to take them were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your heart attack it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8586644 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after a heart attack
8586645 regardless of the mechanism or explanation physicians should be careful when assessing each patients medication needs patients also need to take their medications exactly as prescribed after a heart attack statins in particular should only be withdrawn after a heart attack under close clinical supervision

8586704 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8586705 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8586706 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way

8586766 one must guard against friendship how is a friend defined he is not what philosophy calls the necessary other but the superfluous third what are friendships ceremonies you drink each others health you open an artery and mingle your blood with that of the friend it is difficult to say when the proper moment for this arrives but it announces itself mysteriously you feel some way that you can no longer address one another formally when once you have had this feeling then it can never appear that you have made a mistake like geert westphaler who discovered that he had been drinking to friendship with the public hangman

8586788 suami aku pernah minta keringanan agar uang rp 300 ribu itu hannya dipotong rp 50 ribu saja namun ketua rt tetap ngotot harus mendapatkan bagian rp 100 ribu
8586789 laporan dari warga sudah kita terima mereka bersedia menjadi saksi bahwa benar ketua rt berinisial isk telah memotong uang blt sebaesar rp 100 ribu untuk setiap penerima blt
8586790 isk selaku ketua rt sudah kita panggil dan telah kita pertemukan dengan warga dalam pertemuan itu isk bersedia mengembalikan uang yang dipungutnya dari warga itu secepatnya sebab apapun alasannya tidak dibenarkan melakukan praktek ilegas tersebut
8586791 tidak benar kalau saya dikatakan melakukan pemotongan yang benar warga dengan sukarela memberi saya jika memang itu tidak diperbolehkan hari ini juga uang tersebut akan saya kembalikan pada yang memberi
8586792 mai incearca sa vezi si ca de a lungul acestui perete niste oameni poarta felurite obiecte care depasesc in inaltime zidul mai poarta si statui de oameni ca si alte fapturi de piatra sau lemn lucrate in chipul cel mai divers iar dintre cei care le poarta unii cum e si firesc scot sunete altii pastreaza tacerea
8586793 sunt asemanatori noua am spus caci crezi ca astfel de oameni au vazut mai intai din ei insisi cat si din sotii lor altceva decat umbrele care cad aruncate de foc pe zidul de dinaintea lor
8586794 cum ar putea vedea altceva spuse el daca intreaga viata sunt siliti sa si tina capetele nemiscate
8586795 dar ce ar putea vedea din obiectele purtate oare nu tot acelasi lucru
8586796 iar daca ei ar fi in stare sa stea de vorba unii cu altii nu crezi ca oamenii nostri ar socoti ca numind aceste umbre pe care le vad ei numesc realitatea
8586797 si ce ar face daca zidul de dinainte al inchisorii ar avea un ecou cand vreunul dintre cei care trec ar emite vreun sunet crezi ca ei ar socoti emisiunea sunetului iscata fiind de altceva in afara umbrei ce le trece pe dinainte
8586798 in general deci am spus eu asemenea oameni nu ar putea lua drept adevar decat umbrele lucrurilor
8586799 priveste acum in ce fel ar putea fi dezlegarea lor din lanturi si vindecarea de lipsa lor de minte daca asa ceva le ar sta in fire atunci cand vreunul dintre ei s ar pomeni dezlegat si silit deodata sa se ridice sa si roteasca grumazul sa umble si sa priveasca spre lumina facand el toate acestea ar resimti tot felul de dureri iar din pricina stralucirii focului n ar putea privi acele obiecte ale caror umbre le vazuse mai inainte ce crezi ca ar zice daca cineva i ar spune ca ceea ce vazuse mai inainte earu desetaciuni dar ca acum se afla mai aproape de ceea ce este si ca intors catre ceea ce este in mai mare masura vede mai conform cu adevarul in plus daca aratandu i l pe fiecare dintre obiectel purtate l ar sili prin intrebari sa raspunda ce anume este lucrul respectiv nu crezi ca el s ar putea afla in incurcatura si ca ar putea socotica cele vazute mai inainte erau mai adevarate decat cele aratate acum
8586800 iar daca l ar sili sa priveasca spre lumina insasi nu cerzi ca l ar durea ochii si ca ar da fuga indarat intorcandu se spre acele lucruri care poate sa le vada si le ar socoti pe acestea in fapt mai sigure decat cele aratate
8586801 dar daca cineva l ar smulge cu forta din locuinta aceasta ducandu l pe un suis greu si pieptis nedadu i drumul pana ce nu l ar fi tras la lumina soarelui oare nu ar suferi si s ar mania ca e tras iar cand ar iesi la soare nu i s ar umple ochii de stralucire astfel incat nu ar putea vedea nimic din lucrurile socotite acum adevarate
8586802 cred ca ar avea nevoie de obisnuinta daca ar fi ca sa vada lumea cea de sus
8586803 la urma el va privi soarele nu in apa nici reflexiile sale in vreun loc strain ci l ar putea vedea si contempla asa cum este pe el insusi in locul sa propriu
8586804 e clar ca aici ar ajunge dupa ce va fi strabatut toate celelalte etape
8586805 ei si nu crezi ca daca omul acesta si ar aminti de prima sa locuinta de intelepciunea de acolo ca si de partasii sai in lanturi el s ar socoti pe sine fericit de pe urma schimbarii iar de ceilalti i ar fi mila
8586806 iar daca la ei ar exista laude si cinstiri si s ar da rasplata celui mai ager in a vedea umbrele ce trec alaturi si care isi aminteste cel mai bine cele ce de obicei se preced se succed sau trec laolalta si care in temeiul acestor observatii ar putea cel mai bine sa prezica ce urmeaza in viitor sa se intample li se pare ca omul nostru ar putea sa poftesca rasplatile acelea si sa i invidieze pe cei onorati la ei si aflati la putere sau ar simiti ce spune homer voind nespus mai degraba argat sa fie pe pamant la cineva neinsemnat sarman si fara de stare consimtand sa pata orisice mai degraba decat sa aiba parerile de acolo si sa traiasca in acel chip
8586807 asa cred zise el ar voi sa pateasca orice mai curand decat sa traiasca in acel chip
8586808 mai gandeste te si la urmatorul aspect daca iarasi acel om coborand s ar aseza in acelasi scaun de unde a plecat oare nu ar avea ochii plini de intunecime sosind deodata dinspre lumea insorita
8586809 iar daca el ar trebui din nou ca interpretand umbrele acelea sa se ia la intrecer cu oamenii ce au ramas totdeauna legati si daca ar trebui s o faca chiar in clipa cand nu vede bine inainte de a si obisnui ochii iar daca acest timp cerut de reobisnuire nu ar fi cu totul scurt oare nu ar da el prilej de ras si nu s ar putea spune despre el ca dupa ce s a urcat a revenit cu vederea corupta si ca nici nu merita sa incerci a sui iar pe cel ce incearca sa i dezlege si sa i conduca pe drum in sus in caz ca ei ar putea sa puna mainile si sa l ucida oare nu l ar ucide
8586810 iata draga glaucon am spus eu imaginea care trebuie in intregime pusa in legatura cu cele mai inainte domeniul deschis vederii e asemanator cu locuinta i inchisoare lumina focului din ea cu puterea soarelui iar daca ai socoti urcusul si contemplarea lumii de sus ca reprezentand suisul sufletului catre locul inteligibilului ai intelege bine ceea ce nadajduiam sa spun de vreme ce asa ceva e dorit sa asculti daca nadejedea acesta e indreptatita zeul o stie

8586823 it is not a problem because there is plenty of space it will be moved a couple of hundred meters yards further down
8586824 in older times shepherds used to take sheep and goats there and dunk them in
8586825 the fact that no such beach existed had caused problems between dog owners and people who did not want dogs in the area
8586826 we believe that there should be a beach for dogs in each district

8586837 the greatest benefits and least risk from hrt are seen in the 99 percent of women who commence hrt for symptom relief near menopause this trial studied much older women who started hrt on average 13 to 14 years after menopause when they had fewer symptoms even in this group improved quality of life was seen in many taking hrt
8586838 i think this is an important study because since whi many have lost sight of the significant benefits of hormone therapy
8586839 this study reinforces the notion that for women with these symptoms hrt can improve your quality of life and the worse your symptoms the more theyll improve
8586840 for relief of symptoms its ok to go on hrt as long as you have none of the absolute contraindications like a history of deep vein thrombosis
8586841 i had with me a nikon camera and around 90 film rolls with tell tale evidence of blatant demographic colonialism being perpetrated by the chinese inside tibet through a systematic disfiguring of all that has to do with tibet its people its culture and age old traditions
8586842 before opening tibet to international tourism china took care to ensure that visitors cant see anything that china does not want them to see it is like a murderer throwing a party after cleaning up the murder site spotting meaningful frames in such a situation is a great challenge to a professional photo journalist
8586843 when i approached the dalai lama for the first time in 1972 at his dharamshala headquarters it was with a kind of professional detachment not out of any reverence or any sense of spiritual allegiance but when i met him i was greatly impressed by him he converted 80 000 tibetan refugees in india into one of the best organised refugee settlements
8586844 it was to lend a sense of credibility to my tibetan studies that i decided to take advantage of the chinese decision to open up tibet to tourists and entered the region for the first time in 2003 on a tourist visa
8586845 there is no doubt that urban parts of tibet have undergone tremendous modernisation wonderful malls wide roads impressive housing complexes and most lavish car brands are seen on the streets only if you can distinguish between a chinese and a tibetan face would you realise who owns these goodies and for whose benefit all this development is being undertaken

8586932 a 2 reduction in emissions over ten years is simply fiddling while rome burns the time for scheming is over now is the time for a programme of action
8586933 a real emissions reduction programme will require significant changes in our lifestyle but the alternative of doing almost nothing will be a lot worse
8586934 a sound programme would be comprehensive covering all industries and all gases the governments scheme is on the right track in that respect
8586935 but a scheme worth supporting would also be fair to all industries and consumers and transparent so everyone can see how the costs and credits have been allocated
8586936 pollution is a cost of business that should be identified at source and that business must be held responsible any cost they pass on to consumers will at least encourage environmentally responsible choices the
8586937 instead we have deferred liability and masses of free credits going to the biggest industries and the worst polluters for years to come this negates any incentive for them to make changes this is not polluter pays its pay the polluters
8586938 credits to assist export exposed industries to adjust to the new regime should be allocated on the basis of need not by blanket donations and exemptions to huge corporate lobbyists
8586939 those free credits could be invested by the government in speeding up energy savings and moving to renewable sources in building resilient and sustainable communities and supporting poor and vulnerable people who will be worst affected by the social and economic upheaval

8587365 this is a bag im designing for the new and improved m amp ms
8587366 gratitude is a quality similar to electricity it must be produced and discharged and used up in order to exist at all
8587367 bienvenida a la casa de los trabajadores de la rep blica argentina nos une una lucha en com n y cont s con el apoyo nuestro tenemos una frondosa relaci n de amistad y colaboraci n con la cut de colombia estamos con cuerpo y alma en esta lucha por ustedes
8587368 es tan dif cil la pelea en el congreso tan ardua tan poco fruct fera en t rmino de lo que se logra ganar con la aprobaci n de los proyectos
8587369 lo importante es profundizar y popularizar la propuesta de cambio para que la gente tenga claro qu es lo que nosotros queremos en la b squeda de llegar a ser gobierno en colombia es como so ar un poco pero es parte de la utop a de lo que estamos trabajando
8587370 este espacio por la cta no es extra o en lo absoluto primero porque yo soy abogada especializada en el derecho laboral en la escuela sindical de colombia y porque trabajo en el senado en la comisi n 7 que tiene que ver con lo laboral
8587371 conjuntamente con gloria ram rez del partido comunista hemos presentado en tres oportunidades el estatuto laboral sin ning n xito pero como una manera de entablar una discusi n en el pa s sobre un tema que ya deber a haberse aprobado porque fue un compromiso en la constituci n del 91
8587372 pero es claro que el empresariado colombiano no tiene ning n inter s en este estatuto sino en derogar normas para precarizar la situaci n laboral
8587373 para crear empleos a mujeres discapacitados personas de bajos recursos y tambi n acabaron con una conquista bien importante que era el contrato de aprendizaje la corte constitucional extra amente desech la demanda de la cut porque no se cumplieron los objetivos de gobierno en cuanto a la generaci n de empleo
8587374 un 67 m s que en el mismo per odo
8587375 hace un mes encontraron a un dirigente sindical desaparecido en abril exactamente igual como encontraron a un asesor m o que mataron hace dos a os descuartizado totalmente
8587376 mataron a todos los dirigente sindicales de uraba zona bananera el dice yo mat 3 000 y lo hice en complicidad con los militares y l era la mano derecha del gobernador que es hoy el presidente de la rep blica con el general montoya que es hoy general del ej rcito colombiano y cuenta como desaparec an a la gente
8587377 el lunes de la semana pasada tuvimos una audiencia en barranca bermejo ah reunimos a trav s de la comisi n de derechos humanos del senado a la mayor a de la gente de la zona de magdalena medio que es una zona que ha sido muy martirizada por el paramilitarismo fueron unas 4 000 personas estuvo la brigada 5 que es la que opera en esa regi n la cooperaci n internacional en derechos humanos todos los organismos en la materia y las declaraciones de la gente eran espeluznantes
8587378 me intranquiliz que hab a gente narrando casos de hace dos meses no s lo de desapariciones sino de la manera de torturar a la gente con motosierras y como la gente muy valerosamente delante de la brigada 5 y los generales tomando nota con agentes de inteligencia tomando foto se paraba y dec a ustedes los de la brigada 5 mataron a mi hijo de esta manera y le pusieron el uniforme de la guerrilla ustedes fueron a un bar donde trabajaba mi hermano que tiene retardo mental lo torturaron le mocharon la cabeza y lo vistieron de guerrillero ustedes con una motosierra empezaron a cortarle la piernas a mi abuela hasta llegar al coraz n no s como aguantamos algo tan terrible en el pa s
8587379 hay una amenaza muy clara en la no resoluci n del conflicto interno en colombia jam s en el tema del proceso del acuerdo humanitario existi realmente la intenci n del gobierno de que hubiera intercambio con el presidente ch vez mordimos una trampa donde cre mos que uribe estaba jugando limpio ellos estaban ganando tiempo para ir ubicando a los comandantes de las farc para asesinarlos uribe no quiere un proceso de paz ni acuerdo en colombia lo que inici apunt fue una escalada infernal torpedeando las pruebas haciendo la inteligencia necesaria hasta terminar con la invasi n a ecuador el asesinato de ra l reyes de iv n r os y toda la hollywoodesca operaci n de rescate de ingrid betancurt que casi lo ha convertido en un rambo universal eso no lo hizo l sino el gobierno norteamericano as como ellos visten a los campesinos con los uniformes de la guerrilla los gringos les pusieron sus uniformes para el operativo
8587380 el peligro de una regionalizaci n del conflicto colombiano la no soluci n de un conflicto que parece interminable es tambi n parte de una estrategia la causa de los problemas de colombia no son las farc son una consecuencia de una sociedad excluyente inequitativa acaparadora concentradora de la riqueza
8587381 convertir al territorio colombiano en la punta de lanza en la retoma y reconquista de lo que perdieron los norteamericanos en am rica latina
8587382 la estrategia es bien combinada porque sino uno no entender a como evo morales tiene que estar pensando a cada rato una maniobra para poder gobernar en bolivia se necesita una estrategia de medios que contrarreste a la otra porque ellos se dan el lujo de decir que no hay libertad de prensa y resulta que despotrican caricaturizan desinforman tienen claro cual es el analfabetismo del siglo xxi que es impedir la posibilidad de conocer la verdad y as los ciudadanos poder formar real opini n
8587383 logran encadenarse entrelazarse en toda am rica latina rctv de venezuela se enlaza con caracol en colombia rcn con globovisi n en venezuela nacional de venezuela con el tiempo de colombia el universal de venezuela con el espectador la naci n de la argentina con el tiempo y cada noticia que pueda ser til para desprestigiarnos y para dar a entender que hay disconformidad en la regi n act an con una sola voz por eso debemos articular y hacer org nica una estrategia de c mo enfrentar a la derecha que se est armando
8587384 estuvo hace poquito en colombia con uribe y no estaban hablando de los derechos humanos o de los derechos de la oposici n porque si hay algo que a uribe le asquea es la oposici n nosotros somos el terrorismo internacional en el pa s y esta reuni n la hizo tambi n con el gobernador rosales del sulla en la regi n del cesar que es una de las cunas del paramilitarismo duro en la regi n y es un gobernador que tiene intenciones separatistas en venezuela y luego vienen y se re nen aqu en rosario con los del campo por eso ellos infundieron desde colombia el paro agr cola cada media hora en todos los noticieros que se ca a cristina fern ndez de kirchner hac an chistes y caricaturas hay que hacer frente a toda esta derecha internacional que viene por lo que ya no les corresponde
8587385 fuimos muchas veces a m xico para decirles que se les estaba metiendo el narcotr fico y el paramilitarismo hoy est n en guayaquil y en esmeraldas en ecuador en quito detuvieron a paramilitares que supuestamente iban a matar al presidente se apoderaron de todas las playas se fueron a la sierra boliviana en santa cruz est n apoderados de caracas entran por el norte que es tachira entran por la guajira que es maracaibo entonces el peligro no es cualquier pendejada esto es una cruzada internacional y tienen reductos en varios pa ses y las tareas las hacen grupos paramilitares organizados pagados por los empresarios
8587386 con el impacto del conflicto tenemos 4 millones de desplazados de los cuales 3 millones son mujeres
8587387 exigimos ya una soluci n al conflicto colombiano por la v a pol tica y una exigencia ya del acuerdo humanitario hay que empezar a taponar esta guerra de larga intensidad cuyo nico objetivo es que primero nadie sepa en colombia que la responsabilidad no es de las farc y segundo porque hay una estrategia para conflictuar toda la regi n

8587441 there are those who wish to use children and schools as social engineers with a view to creating a different society but we should not even be trying to do such things
8587442 children need to be nurtured educated and cared for not thrown into the frontline of social reform muddled thinking is guaranteeing failure for the noble aspirations we all commonly hold for the education of the young
8587443 teachers simply do not have the contact time to create behaviours and attitudes within children
8587444 they are not and cannot be social engineers and social workers and surrogate parents as well as subject teachers all rolled into one
8587445 far more serious crimes such as smoking in a public place or being muslim without due care and attention
8587446 we never sent it to anyone but the station so the leak has come from the police
8587447 these are local kids and we are worried they will identify us
8587448 a complaint regarding youths playing football in a street in north leith was received
8587449 the community beat officer has met with the resident and outlined the police response to this issue
8587450 a number of these new entrepreneurs had realistic plans and administrative ability most of them lacked these characteristics but were able to sell their ideas to investors because of the novelty of the dot com concept

8587457 if you were like four inches tall you could live in it
8587458 this is my way of explaining to her my heritage
8587459 i want her to get a miniature hands on of how my life was growing up
8587460 if you were like four inches tall you could live in it
8587461 it was basically the major crop that was used for many things mill moonshine and hominy
8587462 i brought me a brand new one saw with all the safety features
8587463 i think michelle obama kicked it off pretty well dont you think
8587464 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house down last night
8587465 what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first thank you president clinton
8587466 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8587467 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take america back
8587468 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8587469 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8587470 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8587471 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8587472 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out i cannot set the precise time or deadline for this
8587473 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention center
8587474 you must remain here and continue fighting if you leave the government house that means we have been defeated
8587475 det er interessant at vi kan g re et s betydningsfuldt fund i et s modent omr de
8587476 feltet indeholder en meget stor oliekolonne vi er ikke vant til l ngere at g re s store fund det er det st rste i norge i mange r
8587477 det kan blive s rdeles profitabelt for os fordi dagny kan udvikles via det n rtliggende sleipner felt
8587478 det er med beklagelse jeg m sige at det nu f r lidt l ngere udsigter det havde v re helt fantastisk for udviklingen i b de det st midt og nordjyske omr der at f en kattegat forbindelse
8587479 det er fordi det har v ret danmarks mest overvurderede aktie det har kun v ret en k ber i markedet og den er v k nu amagerbanken mistede pusten i g r alle har undret sig over hvorfor den har ligget s h jt s det store fald er faktisk ikke s overraskende n r der ikke er nogle k bere er der ingen bund i den analytikerne mener at den skal koste mellem 75 og 80 kr pr aktie s der er et stykke ned endnu
8587480 ja vi har set nogle ret store fantasital men for en klub som aab svarer disse bel b ikke til det vi ser som realistisk nogen har hidset sig op til enorme bel b omfattende yderligere sponsorindt gter og stigende v rdi af vores spillere men det er jo ren spekulation
8587481 det er vurderingen at der er et stort potentiale p dette marked men til trods herfor har selskabet besluttet ikke l ngere at fokusere p steuropa som marked det er vurderingen at det tyske ejendomsmarked p t byder p langt bedre investeringsmuligheder som ligger inden for rammerne af selskabets investeringsstrategi
8587482 resultatet i f rste kvartal 2008 09 er under det forventede elektronik divisionen udvikler sig fornuftigt mens resultaterne i mekanik division er lavere end forventet fortsat som f lge af de forsvarsrelaterede projekter
8587483 kapacitetsudnyttelsen inden for mekanik og printkort divisionerne er fortsat ikke h j nok men det arbejder vi p at ndre grundet udviklingen i f rste kvartal har vi gennemf rt en n dvendig tilpasning p vores fabrikker i europa vi har fuldt fokus p forretnings og resultatudviklingen og tilpasser virksomheden l bende vi har fortsatte forhandlinger i relation til de forsvarsrelaterede ordrer i mekanik divisionen og det tager jeg som et godt og positivt tegn

8587513 of course weve got to tackle climate change its a real and present danger for used but weve also got to be absolutely clear that our energy policy has got to be figured first and foremost with a view to supplying britain with affordable and secure energy it needs for the future that is why we cannot turn our back on any proven form of technology we cannot afford to say no to new coal new gas or new nuclear

8587525 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8587526 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8587527 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8587528 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure
8587529 you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8587530 i watched how he touched people how he obama inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8587531 clearly it began the process of differentiating obama and mccain in a tasteful and relevant way
8587532 i was especially touched by his comments about his mother also its nearly impossible to follow bill clinton but he did it after today all divisions in the party have been healed
8587533 i thought the roof was going to come off the building when obama came out
8587534 8 25 08 08 45 i team observed and eye4c sign on a black postal service storage box se corner of 18th and pennsylvania area checked for surveillance cameras none found
8587535 we are in twenty states about half of them have democratic governors and the others are republicans this is a way to show our support for our state partners and frankly governor bredesen deserves recognition for what he has done no matter what state he was from
8587536 i am proud to be here and have the opportunity to meet with a fine delegation
8587537 to me the highlight was michelle obamas speech she had an energy about her and told a very personal story that many of us could relate to
8587538 i thought hillary was very good but i dont think it was out of the ball park
8587539 not an adjective that can properly describe the improper financial leadership inflicted on the country by bush cheney and his crew they have borrowed more money in six years than was ever borrowed in all years combined by the american government since its birth
8587540 borrow and spend republicans have inflicted damage on this country more than any congressional fiscal policy in history the money we have borrowed has interest and must be paid there is no getting around that
8587541 the reason i am running is that we have a current senator who seems to get a pass all the time but he is doing woefully in representing the people of tennessee
8587542 i am not talking about his character he is an acquaintance of mine and many of yours but he is doing a woeful job in the senate economic leadership of senate republicans and bush have damaged this country and alexander has been a part of that leadership by congressmen tanner and cooper the progress they make in the u s house is stopped in the senate by republican filibusters and alexander

8587555 members have indicated clearly that they are not prepared to accept below inflation pay or a repeat of last years 10 month delay staff are feeling betrayed and management and the government need to act quickly in order to avoid embarrassing industrial action in acas
8587556 with the government losing the goodwill of the people who deliver the everyday things we take for granted there is a rapid need for it to rethink its approach to public sector pay

8587568 just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8587569 everything ive learned in my eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8587570 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8587571 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it and change it is exactly what barack obama will do
8587572 as oil companies post the biggest profits in history nearly half a trillion dollars in the last five years john wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks thats not change thats the same
8587573 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our next president
8587574 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for

8587602 ive marveled at how utterly non threatening the guy is whos running as the democratic candidate to be the leader of the free world i think thats a substantial part of his appeal to younger voters he doesnt quite seem like a grownup hes not a businessman not the way youd see your dad or grandpa as a businessman hes this boyish sensitive man with a wife who seems to be much more man than he gregg by the way noticed that when the two of them were on stage the other night and they were going to greet the audience michelle obama strode ahead of him like a power walker instead of taking his arm and going along to support him verrrry interesting

8587663 i asked i knew i wasnt going to be impressed just by the look on his face
8587664 he said he doesnt know these are the sort of questions he like to ask face to face not over the telephone
8587665 see i set before you this day a blessing and a curse
8587666 the blessing that you hearken to the commandments of hashem your g d that i command you today and the curse if you do not hearken to the commandments of hashem your g d but turn aside from the path which i command you today to go after other gods that you did not know
8587667 then it shall come to pass that the place which hashem your g d shall choose to cause his name to dwell there there you will bring all that i command you your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithes and the offering of your hand and all your choice vows which you vow unto hashem

8587687 id like to share with you 9 tracks from the new guns n roses album chinese democracy these are mastered finished versions that you probably havent heard i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some deleted with a blog so hey i told you so
8587688 research on identity within the field of psychology should broaden its focus to include a wider unit of analysis than the solitary individual
8587689 sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me
8587690 the evolution of the cerebral cortex certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and culture and to respond to pain associated with social interactions
8587691 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8587692 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8587693 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8587694 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8587695 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes
8587696 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8587697 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8587698 we dont know how to account for the resilience of some stressed people exposed to severe sustained stress or the vulnerability of some people to relatively mild stress
8587699 he will be fine its not life threatening or anything like that but he does have some broken bones and hes stable
8587700 the crash was on the m1 around the leicester nottingham area and while it was a bad crash in the grand scheme of things its very mendable
8587701 while security is obviously necessary for american officials in iraq we should be transitioning reconstruction to the iraqi government which is capable of supporting many of these efforts with its oil revenues
8587702 will increasingly take over these former military roles and missions increasing the numbers of private security
8587703 to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies
8587704 thats why we are here and we are proud to stand with him as he leads the fight for a smarter and tougher foreign policy so that we can finally end the war in iraq go after the terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 and defeat them where they are strongest in afghanistan
8587705 in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be the national interest and without regard to outside religious pressures or dictates and no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise
8587706 there may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia
8587707 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
8587708 im uh sorry but this issue is uh above my pay grade ill have to withhold judgment and uh recuse myself from votes
8587709 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8587710 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8587711 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama
8587712 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8587713 more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy more band aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured more going it alone in the world instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence
8587714 will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years and back to hope
8587715 and so if you like me believe that america must always be a place called hope then join hillary and chelsea and me in making barack obama the next president of the united states
8587716 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8587717 water stations and sanitary facilities will be provided within the zone
8587718 judge krieger relied on assurances that the city would provide water and sanitation facilities at the demonstration zone and theyre not
8587719 its just one more thing making it inhospitable for protesters its so desolate there that no one wants to use it
8587720 the whole idea was that it was supposed to be within sight and sound of delegates who would be walking on this path by the demonstration site to the convention none of the delegates are walking on that path
8587721 both sides indicated that discussions regarding an accommodation have resumed

8587724 the work for the people of california and to solve this budget problem is the most important thing right now for me
8587725 we recognize his responsibilities in california and well certainly work with him regarding scheduling should that issue arise
8587726 northrop grummans hornet system leverages the latest advances in real time coupling of human brain activity with automated cognitive neural processing to provide superior target detection
8587727 the system will maintain persistent surveillance in order to defeat an enemys attempts to surprise through evasive move stop move tactics giving the u s warfighter as much as a 20 minute advantage over his adversaries
8587728 the idea of this project is to build a visual device that is attentive that can do the kind of low level visual processing that your eyes do naturally
8587729 you would see a certain picture in your field of view but the device would actually be looking over a much wider space and if it found something interesting it would present you with that picture as well
8587730 neuromorphic engineering is interdisciplinary using fields that include biology physics mathematics and computer science as well as electrical and other types of engineering its aim is to develop artificial systems such as vision devices or auditory processors or even robotic systems based to a degree on natural biological systems
8587731 this is a highly interesting platform problem because you really are trying to build at least initially a simple representation of one layer of human brain cortex maybe multiple layers if you can
8587732 you need a great deal of computational power robustness and performance and it becomes possible because a configurable analog digital system has a power efficiency improvement of up to 10 000 times compared to an all digital system
8587733 in the arctic seems to be happening before their eyes sea ice in the is at its second lowest level in about 30 years
8587734 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8587735 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8587736 the total investment of the project is expected to be about 3 billion
8587737 the legal basis for the war itself was and still is controversial there is a military need at least at the outset of operations to reinforce the legal base for deployment by clear unequivocal and timely direction and explanation
8587738 leaders should not start an operation without thinking it is not enough just to identify the desired end state
8587739 in whitehall the internal opsec operational security regime in which only very small numbers of officers and officials were allowed to become involved in telic business constrained broader planning for combat operations and subsequent phases effectively until 23 december 2002
8587740 the uk had to work to a timetable and strong ideological views set in the united states
8587741 the requirements to plan find resources for and undertake interim government and reconstruction in iraq the non military tasks were discussed in outline across whitehall but approaches to potential contractors were not made until combat operations were coming to an end planning was not done in sufficient depth and at the outset of phase iv post combat operations little finance was requested and approved for reconstruction purposes
8587742 t he uk government which spent millions of pounds on resourcing the security line of operations spent virtually none on the economic one on which security depended
8587743 obligations under the geneva conventions are laid on states and their agencies and not just on their armed services
8587744 coalition partners take different stances on other issues too including notably the law this embraces international and human rights law proportionality and collateral damage concepts
8587745 r elevant to the uk role in debriefing some of the high value detainees strong consideration should be given to the assignment of a legal adviser to any uk commander or group in a coalition operation when sensitive issues including debriefing and detention are likely to arise a formal review and promulgation of uk interrogation debriefing and detention guidance to uk staff embedded with coalition units is essential
8587746 british commanders and forces faced several constraints as subordinate partners in iraq there were significant differences in approach particularly relating to counter insurgency british counter insurgency experience is respected by some coalition commanders but others had not studied previous campaigns or did not want to hear about northern ireland or colonial struggles eg in malaya or kenya the unrest and violence following the fall of the saddam regime were recognised by british officers in mid 2003 as indicators of insurgent activity but it took longer for us commanders to accept this and to take suitable counter measures
8587747 i ntelligence cells were built on a similar basis to those used in northern ireland some battlegroups were fortunate enough to be able to use trained people experienced in northern ireland in the same role during their tours in iraq information operations psyops and media operations were effective
8587748 s omeone said it is just like northern ireland when i came back i asked which part of northern ireland were you in
8587749 the accepted level of violence had altered one commander said
8587750 there have been 191 investigations since the start of operations in iraq 171 of these investigations have been closed with no further action there are 5 cases which could be classed as deliberate abuse
8587751 because matt and i have quite a few things in common
8587752 are you gonna be in there all night theres people out here waiting you know
8587753 we had no idea what was happening until police started showing up and i went out and talked to them
8587754 theyre interested in seeing police officers as well as protesters
8587755 someone clocked me in the face and took my shoe in the moshpit
8587756 im marching because it seems to be the last vestiges of our free speech and because people have demands and our governments not listening

8587779 le pido a los gremios que abran las puertas de las aulas y dejen de poner a los chicos en situaci n de rehenes involuntarios
8587780 hay que saber separar los hechos que se registran por inseguridad en la provincia de aquellos que se producen entre bandas de narcotraficantes con ajustes de cuenta y amenazas
8587781 gobierno la provincia que m s invierte en educaci n a principios de a o marzo aumentamos un 24 por ciento el salario de los decentes pero ahora no voy prometer cosas que no voy a cumplir y tampoco voy a llevar a la provincia a desequilibrios

8587783 en esta ltima reuni n se ha propuesto incorporar el aumento del 10 4 por ciento ofrecido al salario b sico y las otras sumas a parte del sueldo y creo que las negociaciones est n muy cerca
8587784 creo que cuando reflexionen sobre estas medidas de fuerza que son un derecho de los docentes se van a dar cuenta que esto podr a haberse evitado por la buena voluntad de mi gobierno
8587785 hay que separar lo que es inseguridad de los que es ajuste de cuentas entre bandas de narcotraficantes como fueron los casos del triple crimen los cr menes de unicenter y la muerte del hombre que cay desde el noveno piso ariel vilan
8587786 nosotros pateamos el hormiguero trabajamos para combatir el narcotr fico desde la participaci n ciudadana y consciente de los riesgos que significa pedimos que la comunidad aporte datos

8587801 we have seen an opportunity for thai financial institutions to benefit from open solutions banking products
8587802 will continue efforts through 2008 to broaden our asian reach
8587803 from the analysis weve seen we believe this is a viable project

8587807 the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8587808 the old sores and divisions fester and russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region
8587809 the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe
8587810 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8587811 in all international institutions we will need to review our relations with russia
8587812 what the hell russias responsibility what about the fact that america is installing nuclear warheads in poland as part of a defense shield
8587813 as for the consequences of russias actions mr miliband said he believed that moscow is now
8587814 chinese culture has developed for 5 000 years without stopping
8587815 we want to introduce our culture to foreign guests and the olympics was an opportunity
8587816 there arent many opportunities to see so many relics together like this
8587817 we thought wed have some lines but never like this
8587818 the terra cotta soldiers are the most important pieces because the qin dynasty unified china
8587819 it also unified chinese writing which was so very important to the development of chinese culture but the dynasty was short there were only two emperors so the cultural relics are very few
8587820 but they havent had an opportunity to see anything from there
8587821 that is honestly the first time i have been asked that i am getting married and having a child today

8587866 i think what hes doing is a little silly and trite apparently he doesnt understand that theres an economic crisis evolving in this country
8587867 people will be looking to understand the rationale besides party loyalty and party unity what is the specific rationale behind his support of barack obama

8587913 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8587914 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8587915 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration

8587922 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8587923 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8587924 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8587925 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8587926 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8587927 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8587928 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8587929 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8587930 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8587931 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8587932 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8587933 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8587934 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8587935 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8587936 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8587937 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8587938 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8587939 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8587940 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8587941 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8587942 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8587943 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8587944 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8587945 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8587946 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8587947 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8587948 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8587949 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8587950 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8587951 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8587952 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8587953 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8587954 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8587955 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8587956 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8587957 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8587973 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8587974 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car

8587978 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8587979 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8587980 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8587981 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8587982 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8587983 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8587984 no one works for someone we all just work together

8587986 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8587987 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8587988 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8587989 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

8587992 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8587993 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8587994 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8587995 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8587996 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8587997 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

8588002 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8588003 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8588004 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8588005 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8588006 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8588007 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8588008 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8588009 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8588010 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8588011 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8588012 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8588013 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8588014 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8588015 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8588016 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8588017 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn

8588175 lord how often shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him
8588176 i do not say to you up to seven times but up to seventy times seven therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants and when he had begun to settle accounts one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents but as he was not able to pay his master commanded that he be sold with his wife and children and all that he had and that payment be made the servant therefore fell down before him saying master have patience with me and i will pay you all then the master of that servant was moved with compassion released him and forgave him the debt but that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me what you owe so his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him saying have patience with me and i will pay you all and he would not but went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt so when his fellow servants saw what had been done they were very grieved and came and told their master all that had been done then his master after he had called him said to him you i forgave you all that debt because you begged me should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant just as i had pity on you and his master was angry and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him so my heavenly father also will do to you if each of you from his heart does not forgive his brother his trespasses

8588233 obama dovr ricostruire il sogno americano e restituire allamerica il suo prestigio nel mondo
8588234 tutto quello che ho imparato nei miei otto anni da presidente e tutto il lavoro che ho fatto da allora in america e nel resto del mondo mi hanno convinto che barack luomo giusto per questo lavoro
8588235 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8588236 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8588237 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni
8588238 voglio che tutti sappiano che sono orgoglioso di avere joe biden e tutta la sua famiglia al mio fianco per riprenderci lamerica

8588244 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8588245 grazie al loro impegno alla dedizione dei giovani ed alla certezza delle posizioni tenute dal partito
8588246 che lunione di centro ha potuto riscuoter consensi senza rimaner schiacciata fra le due grandi coalizioni elettorali pdl lega e pd idv mantenendo quindi una significativa rappresentanza parlamentare la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori siamo consci che nel periodo in cui viviamo i veti pregiudiziali e lostruzionismo allazione di governo siano deleteri per un paese che cerca di risollevarsi testimonianza ne la presenza in aula dei nostri parlamentari a garanzia del numero legale per un corretto svolgimento dei lavori di contro votar a scatola chiusa i disegni di legge presentati significherebbe allinearsi su posizioni che non ci appartengono e sulle quali nutriamo forti perplessit

8588260 the christianity that white people got and the christianity that black people got was not the same
8588261 i think last years struggles gave us more focus in the spring
8588262 it forced all of us to get back to the basics and work on our blocking tackling and carrying the ball we used last seasons experiences as a rallying cry and came to the realization that you cant take things for granted we found that we must live for today the fact that we struggled really got the attention of our younger players
8588263 we want to win the conference get into the ncaa tournament and win the national championship the conference is more difficult than ever with more parity among the teams every game will be crucial and it is more important to go out and win every week
8588264 i think moving to 10 teams in the conference is an advantage because you become more familiar with your opponents
8588265 we will play the same nine teams every year i think it also helps with scheduling and strength of schedule it provides teams in the njac with more experience against good teams hopefully it will help the conference in sending more teams to the ncaas
8588266 he is a nice addition to the team and will challenge hagerty for the starting job graff is making a smooth transition from wideout to quarterback
8588267 we return a strong group of experienced veterans at wide receiver
8588268 edwards is becoming a more vocal leader and assuming more of a leadership role he is confident in himself and hopefully his confidence will transfer to his teammates terebizh had a breakout season and we hope to see him progress further mark lisa had a big first year sanders showed quite a bit of improvement in the spring all three freshmen are good wide receivers that can make an instant impact
8588269 we are moving hinds to nose tackle in order to get the best players on the field
8588270 he provides more experience to the inside of the defensive line hinds is the most vocal of our three captains and we expect a lot from him quarles is a very physical player and he comes from a strong high school program
8588271 he has been waiting in the wings behind tosh and now it is his turn to step up hoffman came on strong last year but was slowed by an injury trotman will make an impact immediately
8588272 we are always strong at linebacker and will continue to be that way
8588273 he took over for bailey at the end of last year and did a good job plunkett carmen aliberti bundy and wall will collectively try to fill bellamys shoes
8588274 quinones played at a high level last year before getting injured stokes should continue to progress dock is a nice addition to the team
8588275 having smith back at punter is a big key for us
8588276 it may be the most important position on the team smith kept us in a lot of games last season his ability to kick the ball deep helps the team tremendously with field position we expect great things out of him once again

8588518 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8588519 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8588520 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8588521 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8588530 ha travisato la storia e la natura dellautentico insegnamento della chiesa cattolica contro laborto
8588531 nel medio evo teorie mal informate ed inadeguate sugli embrioni hanno condotto alcuni teologi a speculare che una vita specificamente umana capace di ricevere unanima immortale non esista fino a qualche settimane della gravidanza
8588532 se nel codice di diritto canonico queste teorie hanno condotto alla distinzione nelle pene tra aborto compiuto nella fase iniziale o avanzata della gravidanza linsegnamento morale della chiesa non giustifica o non permetta ma laborto a nessuno stadio di sviluppo
8588533 queste errate teorie biologiche aggiungono i vescovi usa sono divenute obsolete pi di 150 anni fa quando gli scienziati hanno scoperto che un nuovo individuo umano viene alla luce dallunione di spermatozoi e ovuli al momento della fecondazione in linea con questa concezione moderna la chiesa insegna che dal momento della concezione fecondazione a ogni membro della specie umana deve essere dato il pieno rispetto dovuto ad una persona umana a partire dal sirpetto per il fondamentale diritto alla vita

8588537 i am not able to respond to your two short works most learned and brilliant with every splendor of eloquence as they are all that genius can say or assume or draw from the fountains of the scriptures has there been said and treated but i beg your reverence to allow me to say something in praise of your genius

8588540 far be it from me to dare to question anything in your beatitudes books i have enough to do to correct my own without criticizing anyone elses
8588541 i am gratified by your interest and your request that i send you my commentary on holy job but if you wish to gorge yourself on delicious fare read the treatises of blessed augustine your compatriot and by comparison with his fine flour you will not ask for my bran
8588542 we read that blessed augustine would not live in the same house with his sister saying the women who are with my sister are not my sisters the caution of that learned man should teach us an important lesson
8588543 in augustines dying we adore your magnificence o lord your power works in all so that this man fired by your spirit was not led astray by flattering promises because you had imbued him with every kind of piety and to you he was altar sacrifice priest and temple
8588544 saint augustine the bishop was keen of mind suave in his eloquence thoroughly familiar with secular literature industrious in his labors for the church clear in everyday discussions well organized in all his activities acute in solving problems careful in arguing with heretics catholic in expounding our faith cautious in explaining the canonical scriptures

8588559 this is a startling amount of change in a major area of peoples lives over a very short period
8588560 achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all
8588561 we fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal
8588562 theres no question that obtaining secured credit has become harder and in many cases more expensive
8588563 as a second charge on a home a secured loan involves a certain risk from a lenders perspective so secured lenders are keeping a very close eye on issues in the housing market
8588564 todays falling prices are reducing the number of homeowners with enough equity to make a secured loan a viable solution and deterring many who are keen to retain their safety margin against negative equity
8588565 having said that its important to see recent falls in house prices in their correct context as relatively small drops following a decade of rapid growth according to nationwides house price index for example the average house in q2 2008 was still worth almost 10 000 more than it was in q2 2006 in just ten years nationwide reports the average house price rose from 60 754 to 184 131 homeowners may be worried about falling prices but many are still likely to own significant levels of equity for them a secured loan can be an excellent debt solution a realistic way to consolidate their unsecured debts into one manageable lower interest debt which they can arrange to repay at an affordable rate secured loans providers like firstplus announce theyre ceasing to make new loans its clear that the secured loans market as a whole is suffering under todays adverse conditions with lenders tightening their criteria or even turning down new business its more important than ever that borrowers choose a company that works with a wide range of lenders and specialises in finding secured loans for people from all kinds of financial backgrounds talking to the right company can make all the difference between being offered credit at a competitive rate and being unable to avail a secured loan at all
8588566 depending on the individuals circumstances a number of other debt solutions may be more appropriate than a secured loan such as a debt management plan an unsecured debt consolidation loan an iva individual voluntary arrangement or for residents of scotland a trust deed for anyone in debt the important thing is to seek impartial debt advice from a company that offers a wide range of debt solutions a company that has an in depth understanding of each solutions benefits and drawbacks and can recommend the one that constitutes their optimal route out of debt
8588567 while studies suggest some of the country feel they have not yet been affected too badly by the credit crunch these people may begin to feel the effects as future events unfold
8588568 the most important thing is staying on top of your finances
8588569 make sure you are meeting all your priority financial commitments before anything else and try to build a budget around that if you find you cant meet those commitments seek expert advice as soon as possible
8588570 we would also advise people to save as much as possible because that little bit extra could come in very useful if things get tight
8588571 its important to distinguish between the different elements of the economic downturn were currently experiencing
8588572 the credit crunch primarily affects people looking for credit particularly homeowners who may be faced with large arrangement fees or higher payments when they remortgage and also those looking to obtain
8588573 people who arent reliant on credit or homeowners who have a long term fixed rate on their mortgage may well have been largely unaffected so far
8588574 but its now very possible that we will see the knock on effects of the weak housing market combined with rising costs of living higher unemployment increasing amounts of people struggling to meet their comments and more people facing problems with debt
8588575 even if it does get to that stage there are still things you can do seeking professional debt advice from an expert debt adviser is essential if you find yourself in financial difficulty
8588576 there are a range of debt solutions available to meet different situations including debt management plans
8588577 why is it that the only people in the mediterranean without access to their own waters are the palestinians

8588580 we are concerned about the continuing violence and this is the first segment of our address so that violence should stop
8588581 if security guards are not standing at the entrances of schools on monday teachers will still arrive for work and they will send their students home
8588582 we cannot allow there to be a situation in which the entrances to our school are unguarded and anyone can just walk right in
8588583 the police inspector general david cohen has held three separate meetings on this issue
8588584 and he has recommended that school security needs to continue the same way it does at the entrances to restaurants banks and event halls
8588585 the responsibility for deployment of security guards at educational institutions is the responsibility of the education ministry to our regret the education ministry did not bother to fight against the budget cuts for security guards which is their job and does not fall under the responsibility of the police
8588586 every year in the past the public security ministry has had the budget for school security guards now that the money isnt there its become our problem
8588587 the way things look right now its impossible to say that every school will be able to open as scheduled
8588588 the government has waited until the last minute engineers are still working on schools and they cant expect this to take care of itself
8588589 its perfectly normal changing bodies growing up sex and sexual health
8588590 the initial agreement has been signed and we are waiting to see the approval of both governments
8588591 china mobile rose after reporting its earnings results at lunch time yesterday but maybe after the market closed investors crunched the numbers some analysts are now more cautious about its prospects

8588644 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power

8588665 john mccain was asked by a new orleans reporter why he voted twice against an independent commission to investigate the governments failings before and after hurricane katrina and he incorrectly stated that he had voted for every investigation mccain actually voted twice in 2005 and 2006 to defeat a democratic amendment that would have set up an independent commission along the lines of the 9 11 commission at the time of the second vote members of both parties were complaining that the white house was refusing requests by senate investigators for information mccains statement that he supported every investigation is false the record shows mccain lined up with his party as it circled the wagons to defend the bush administration against a more aggressive probe of what went wrong before and after katrina

8588667 rugby in germany is an up and coming sport and following the success of our mens team in winning division two last season we feel that this bid to host a global event would be a second big boost for the game in this country together with sportfive we are confident we could make a success of this exciting venture
8588668 for germany to play against the likes of new zealand and england here in our home country would be a fantastic experience for the womens team and it would also be great for the german public to see in close up the strength of womens rugby as a team we would give everything to put on a good display against the elite

8588677 entrepreneurship is one of the fastest growing fields within economics management finance and even law
8588678 it is widely recognized that entrepreneurship is somehow important but there is little consensus about how the entrepreneurial role should be modeled and incorporated in economics and strategy
8588679 execution is the result of thousands of decisions made every day by employees acting according to the information they have and their own self interest

8588685 this audience record is something i thought id never see again but what really satisfied me is the way in which these olympics truly captivated and seemed to inspire our country
8588686 for me the greatest measure of success at an olympics is the number of messages i receive from parents of young kids who have fallen in love with the olympics that child means more to me than anything because i think a love affair with the olympics is the greatest in all of sports

8588697 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms

8588702 but it doesnt mean too much the stage is not like the real roads but im happy i didnt drive in gravel for a long time and i have never driven with this pirelli control tyre
8588703 i like the stages here now lets see what can happen on the rally
8588704 we need fabrizio to score zero points in the first two races and for me to win both to stand any hope of winning the title all i can do is try to qualify on pole win races and set fastest laps
8588705 fortunately silverstone should suit our leon tdi perfectly and i think well be very strong there the track only has six corners two of which are tight and lead on to long straights and thats exactly where we can benefit from the extra torque of the turbo diesel engine
8588706 if i retire from this rally and he hirvonen wins he would be six points in the lead
8588707 this is a very important time in the championship and finishing is everything right now its very delicately balanced
8588708 winning here would be nice but the main thing is for me to make sure im still in the lead of the championship we have two more asphalt rallies to come and on those events dani sordo citroen teammate and i were strong
8588709 barack obama and i took very different journeys to this destination but we share a common story
8588710 we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they just try hard enough that was americas promise for those of us who grew up in middle class neighborhoods like scranton and wilmington
8588711 these are common stories among middle class people whove worked hard their whole life played by the rules on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays that promise is the promise of america
8588712 it defines who we are as a people and now its in jeopardy i know it you know it but john mccain doesnt seem to get it barack obama gets it though
8588713 my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you everyone is your equal and everyone is equal to you
8588714 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8588715 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong and barack obama was right
8588716 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abysmal failure
8588717 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8588718 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8588719 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea change in america doesnt start from top down it starts from the bottom up that change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things
8588720 and so we want to open up this convention to make sure that everyone who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back i think we are going to have a great night tomorrow night and i look forward to seeing you there god bless you god bless america
8588721 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8588722 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the unites states
8588723 madame secretary i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the further conduct of the roll call vote
8588724 all votes cast by the delegates will be counted and that i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8588725 without a strong democratic majority in the senate his ambitious agenda will be thwarted by the defenders of the status quo whose goals can be boiled down to a single word no
8588726 i thought bill clinton hit a home run today and hillary hit one last night
8588727 bill clinton put his finger exactly on the heart of the matter when he came to office people said he had no experience with the national economy with international affairs and he succeeded beyond his wildest expectations i know barack obama i know bill clinton i worked with both men and i have extraordinary confidence in barack obamas ability
8588728 his speech was brilliant he really talked about the difference between mccain and barack obama
8588729 and he clearly showed why we should all support barack obama if there are any remaining hillary supporters who didnt feel they shouldnt be with barack i think thats all gone away both clintons have made it clear that he represents the future
8588730 i think that he has sound judgment and wisdom and a curious mind i think he knows what hes doing
8588731 hes ready to be commander in chief and hes got a great partner in joe biden so im very happy
8588732 its the first time that unanimous by proclamation by unanimous consent that we have an african american president
8588733 it just cant get better for america thats why were here
8588734 this is a great moment not just for our country but for the world because he is going to be the leader of the free world
8588735 but we need to recognize that thats the case we have to re double our efforts we take nothing for granted
8588736 warum m nner nicht zuh ren und frauen schlecht einparken
8588737 liest man die verschiedenen modernen theorien ber m nner wundert man sich dass sie nicht regelm ig gemeinsam in die w lder verschwinden um dort wie eine horde wildschweine zu jagen im erdreich zu buddeln und zu grunzen warum einige m nner aus der art schlagen und keineswegs damit besch ftigt sind ihren samen immerzu an die frau zu bringen sondern lieber autos bauen dem nobelpreis entgegenforschen und wunderbare romane schreiben erkl ren uns die anthropologen leider nicht

8588741 frauen die sich f r superfrauen halten und in st ndiger emp rungsbereitschaft sind wenn es um fehler der m nner geht unentwegt stellen diese frauen ihre anspr che laut vernehmlich nachdr cklich sie glauben sie h tten ein recht darauf dass ihre w nsche erf llt werden
8588742 der mann wurde zum t ter die frau zum opfer der mann steht dauernd auf dem pr fstand m nnerfeindlichkeit sei zum kulturellen mainstream geworden
8588743 dass m nner politisch korrekt auf die bed rfnisse der frauen eingehen m ssten dabei verst ndnisvoll und antiautorit r sein sollten

8588748 es geht den frauen um geld aber auch um status und ansehen berufliches versagen wird als pers nliches versagen gesehen da k nnen die zeitungen noch so viel schreiben von konjunktur und jobkrise
8588749 einen richtigen mann also einen mann der erfolgreich ist geld verdient ansehen hat dem aber die karriere nicht so wichtig ist dass er sich nicht gleichzeitig um ehefrau haus kinder und hund k mmert und seine weiblichen anteile entdeckt und pflegt
8588750 nur sollte sie nicht erwarten dass all diese sich widersprechenden w nsche erf llt werden
8588751 viele frauen investieren mitunter viel zeit energie und gef hle um ihrem ex das leben zur h lle zu machen
8588752 schon ein anfang wenn frauen sich klar machen wie sehr sie sich mit ihrem destruktiven verhalten selbst schaden und wenn frauen anderen frauen derart fieses benehmen nicht mehr so einfach durchgehen lassen

8588758 youre almost investing time when no one is watching and hoping that it works out
8588759 and when you enter an olympic center later on that does sort of alleviate some of the costs but by and large you are spending thousands dollars by yourself shawn johnsons parents actually mortgaged their home twice in order to support her career in gymnastics which clearly paid off but at the time you dont know
8588760 i retired after my first olympics i couldnt afford to stay in the sport
8588761 i had to have a way to make money and pay for my existence so its tough you need to sacrifice a lot you have to really want it you have to be looking at the whole picture and find a way to live within small means in order to be an athlete

8588823 das macht man eigentlich nur bei spielern die k rperlich richtig angeschlagen sind aber miro ist ja k rperlich belastbar
8588824 das mag sein aber er hat gesagt dass er k rperlich wieder auf ein hohes niveau muss dann wird er mit sicherheit wieder der alte klose
8588825 wenn er wieder die weiten wege gehen kann wird er treffen und als vorbereiter gl nzen das muss er bald schaffen und nicht erst in weiter ferne
8588826 wir alle glauben an ihn wir sch tzen unseren spieler miro wei dass er sich auf uns verlassen kann
8588827 dass miro nat rlich besser spielen muss da sind wir uns alle einig

8588842 we didnt anticipate such a big response from the market from the customers
8588843 the olpc had several effects in terms of pricepoint it slashed the market open for that type of device
8588844 it also had people talking about the emerging markets but actually in reality in the western world what it talked about was cheaper pcs
8588845 the whole concept whilst 100 was not feasible certainly blew the market open and started people talking about this and really it was one of the catalysts for the whole eee pc platform style thing to take off
8588846 it was a very very bold statement which unfortunately hasnt come to pass as predicted but it did make a lot of people go back and look at the education market and they thought well perhaps there is something here we cant hit 100 but well try and well make it say 300 or 200 and all the arguments for there being computers in classrooms are true even in countries that are relatively well off
8588847 so that was where the asus came for the education market that wasnt being addressed properly the olpc demonstrated that
8588848 the asus eee came from a different engineering idea marketwise it was very similar
8588849 we have a smaller screen we run less memory we get the costs out of the system any way we can

8588863 i havent seen a definite release date for the blackberry curve on the at amp t network and the reported issues with the 3g radio may be delaying the release there were reports that the infineon chip was a possible cause of the problem
8588864 network changes to make a faulty 3g device work in our network because its from apple
8588865 im just not convinced this is apples problem here in richmond va i get horrible 3g data performance
8588866 man no matter how many people spend unmeasurable hours trying to help me i will continue to complain and discredit them
8588867 the 3g does not make me talk any faster laugh if i bring up a web page and it takes me an extra second or even minute i am not worried as edge or 3g works very well i can see if your in the middle of a train track and a train is coming and you were wondering what time it left the station before you get hit by it i can see then how 3g heck 10g would be really a good thing for you before you get hit be happy
8588868 the most recent studies by wired and others bluestest in sweden seem to be all starting to point the finger at the networks and not the phone
8588869 made the iphone 3g use the network in ways and to levels that have never happened before and problems are appearing because like the tyres in my example the networks at least some of them simply cant handle it
8588870 well put in a service ticket for the areas where youre losing signal
8588871 the power control issue will also have an effect on the data throughput
8588872 because the higher the data rate the more power the node b transmitter requires to transmit if the ues have poor power control and are taking more power than is necessary then it will sap the networks ability to deliver high speed data

8588962 this week i m addressing the physical needs of an internet marketer for a couple of reasons
8588963 we should be asking people what they need this will vary from county to county between cities and even within cities
8588964 local authorities and operators can then decide how best to use their resources
8588965 expanding the reach of cdm in developing countries with emphasis in africa
8588966 the countrys productive forces and productive relations have witnessed an appreciable depreciation after the overthrow of the first president of the country osagyefo dr kwame nkrumah
8588967 the akosombo dam tema harbour numerous industries dotted across the country and the provision of quality education including the establishment of secondary schools polytechnics and the universities were very good initiatives undertaken by the first republic to build a good economy
8588968 today the commanding heights of the ghanaian economy remains in the hands of multinationals whose sole aim is to make super profits from their operations in the country which has led to the impoverishment of the vast majority of the people
8588969 it is not true that the first republican government led by nkrumah had more resources at its disposal for development than governments that had come after it ghanaians must pull down their veil of ignorance and be well informed about the financial transactions in each regime from the first to the fourth republics not forgetting the military interregnum
8588970 ghana today has virtually become a net importer of items ranging from toothpicks to canned fish when industries for the production of these items existed in the nkrumah regime in a nutshell we are contribution to the expansion of the economies of countries where these items were imported from to the detriment of ours
8588971 external events such as the dictation of prices of our export products on the international commodity prices the sharp and regular increase in the prices of oil and poor terms of trade have had a deleterious effect on our economy which i initially said had become neo colonial
8588972 the net effect is that such products are more patronised than what is produced by home grown industries in such a situation where locally manufacturing concerns witness a dive in their profits they resort to retrenching workers who swell the countrys unemployment which had been a recipe for social unrest and agitation in the country
8588973 the gcpp will offer subsidies by way of inputs to the two industries and expose its practitioners to regular programmes to enhance their skills in addition the party would take a critical look at the financial and transport sectors to support the existing manufacturing concerns in the country and encourage the establishment of new ones to offer employment avenues to the people especially the youth in the country
8588974 we will also take another look at the countrys tax regime to make it more responsive to the aspirations of the nation especially the agricultural manufacturing and industrial concerns which constitute the backbone of ghanas economy
8588975 people will give you money hoping that when you come to power you will also give them jobs to do therefore anybody who tells you that people donate simply because they want to donate is not telling you the truth
8588976 when you dont have money you claim some medicines are not good enough for you
8588977 non credo sia giusto negare ad un bambino il diritto ad avere una figura materna solo perch hai un gigantesco ego
8588978 its kind of like cross training you want to practice not multitask
8588979 the current market conditions continue to challenge our business as retailers affected by lower consumer spend defer store investment decisions and exert pressure on their supply chain
8588980 our focus on the food sector is providing some protection from the current economic climate and we are concentrating on maintaining and developing our customer relationships we have taken decisive action to control cost in order to create a business capable of flexing with market conditions in the longer term styles amp wood is well positioned to take advantage of the retailers need to return to store investment plans
8588981 the decline in the commercial property market is only partly affecting hbg but this decline is more than offset by the increasing number of contracts from the public sector
8588982 we have to rush to educate people on the traffic laws
8588983 and we have to enforce laws like helmets for motorbike riders and their passengers

8588986 not only are our poor eating it but there is also demand from vietnamese living on the border with us
8588987 some socially deprived people in bihar have always consumed rat meat if they can eat rats why cant the rest of the people
8588988 this will help in mitigating the global food crisis we are sure that it will work wonders
8588989 about being under the sea probably as a picture of having to deal with a lot of trouble but kind of being in the eye of the storm

8588997 magnussens toyota of palo alto california one of the us top prius dealers has decided to begin taking 500 deposits for plug in 2010 priuses
8588998 we didnt have him in team work tuesday but he did fine and hasnt experienced any problems
8588999 so far so good hell get a little more work today
8589000 weve been telling you guys that hes been doing a lot of things and we have a pretty extensive workout before we let guys get back on the field
8589001 they go through a routine on the side and do some individual work and its like a decathlon so when we clear guys to come back i usually dont worry about how theyre going to be
8589002 its still to be determined from what we do and a lot of that will be based on the medical report on jim and peyton
8589003 so those guys gray and lorenzen are both going to play well see how they do and then well determine whether we keep four three or two
8589004 but hey you know what they say when you assume
8589005 the trade situation has already been presented the game doesnt really matter
8589006 i know jeff was visiting getting more looks at it
8589007 it was good to see him back on the field dressed and ready to go
8589008 hopefully hell be back all next week i think hell be fine because we know how hard he works
8589009 on the consumer side we started in may with 22 base stations in the johannesburg pretoria area which during the past few months has doubled to 44 consumer services are now also available in parts of cape town and durban
8589010 a base station covers an area of roughly one to one and a half kilometres
8589011 base station roll out is exponential greatly increasing our coverage areas
8589012 just the speed of deployment of wireless technologies means that we can install in the minimum of time
8589013 add to that the scalability of the product which allows the customer to increase their bandwidth with no physical intervention and the ability for true multiplay data internet and voice we have a truly winning combination
8589014 we have been working very closely with telkom to put the necessary systems in place for geographic number portability
8589015 the impact on the customer is enormous as it now allows them the flexibility of choosing the best service provider to meet their needs while retaining the number that their customers have come to know
8589016 during the porting process the numbers will be advertised on both the telkom and neotel networks for 48 hours to allow for a smooth transition and ensure that all calls continue to be routed without interruption
8589017 this means that we have not needed to deploy any additional technologies and therefore it has been much easier for us to get to this stage
8589018 we designed this product with customers in mind who still use a dial up connections to the internet
8589019 ethernet ports chew up power and would require a more substantial power back up we are working with various vendors to develop a suitable device and hope to launch an ethernet option soon
8589020 i believe the company is well placed to drive even greater levels of value for our customers and partners at an individual organisational and national level making them more competitive and more able to achieve their potential we believe mtetos experience makes him the ideal person to drive our local business forward
8589021 south africa is a key market for microsoft and this is an exciting time for the ict industry and the country its an honour to be leading a team that is committed and passionate about contributing to the nation and its people in this way

8589024 we cannot claim to be a power with global impact if we do not take up responsibilities we are ready to protect the ships passing through the mozambique channel between madagascar and south east africa which is plagued by piracy
8589025 the cpi m firmly stands for the right to strike by the working class as a fundamental right
8589026 it has consistently supported the all india general strikes of the trade unions against the neo liberal policies of the central government and other urgent issues of the working class and toiling people
8589027 personally i dont support strikes bandhs shutdowns do not help the country
8589028 unfortunately i belong to a political party they call strikes and i keep mum

8589051 in home after home the abuse is there the only difference now is that inspections are going on
8589052 we assumed that everything had changed since leas cross while there are more inspections the problem is that people are still being abused
8589053 in all the investigations both in the past and the latest revelations you are seeing the same issues arising with complaints of bed sores no proper drug administration policy and a lack of adequate staffing
8589054 the vast majority of hospitals and nursing homes have excellent staff but there seems to be a small minority that think they can get away with what they are doing to elderly patients
8589055 this is wrong and appropriate action has to be seen to be taken

8589057 i was on my way to the funeral and when i got closer to the bridge i saw two men in a jeep on the other side it was only when i got 20 yards further on that i saw a mountain of stuff in front of me and it was maybe 15ft in height
8589058 its a long journey but i had to leave my van in the yard as it was useless to me i had to let my wife and son padraig know what had happened and to warn them that they couldnt get in
8589059 ive been told that it could be a few more days at least but we just dont know how long its going to take to get the road open
8589060 it was just frightening but thanks be to god no one was injured and no one is dead
8589061 there could have been any number of people on that bridge at the time you wouldnt see it coming and apparently it only took three minutes

8589067 kerry used to be a milk price leader setting the pace for the industry and always paying a top price now kerry has fallen back to ninth position out of 13 in the 2007 farmers journal kpmg audit
8589068 this july kerry has slipped once again and is paying its suppliers less than the other two big milk purchasers dairygold and glanbia

8589075 in the past few months i have been talking to many business people who are under pressure with the combination of high street rents mixed with the economic downturn making their businesses unsustainable
8589076 we want to turn this to our advantage and to the advantage of the retailer offering viable rents which can make doing business in these current times much more sustainable to the retailer and lead to better prices for the customer
8589077 this would offer destination shopping at its best with a carnaby street concept all on one floor
8589078 it is the perfect time for retailers to look at the value there is to be had from our retail proposition at the moment
8589079 as well as this with many retailers cutting down on promotions we plan to increase our activities and attract even more shoppers to killarney offering even greater choice and value and a truly different shopping experience

8589083 total employment linked to the irish food and drink industry is almost 230 000 and the sector has a gross output of over 18 billion per year
8589084 within this speciality food has shown particular strong growth and become big business in a country where many traditional farmers have had to diversify in order to stay afloat
8589085 through the publicity and business opportunities created by blas na h ireann we are hoping to help in the creation of long term sustainable markets for these products and also to use its quality as a means of attracting visitors the world over to ireland

8589095 the project is under pinned by the belief that if these stories customs and events are not recorded then society as a whole will be all the poorer they say in order to plan for the future we should look to the past and learn first
8589096 interviews are presently ongoing all over the south kerry area and the folklore committee is very pleased with what has been collected to date

8589166 at the moment its just like a bowl and its trapped there and it can go nowhere
8589167 there is more water septic tanks stormwater household water going into that land and it cant cope
8589168 i think this area in particulars probably had about a quarter of its annual rainfall
8589169 well yeah but if the land around it hadnt been raised there wouldnt be the problem that there is
8589170 we had it down at funland pizza i got everyone twenty dollars worth of tokens and five whole pepperoni pizzas
8589171 a lot of my co workers were invited but most of them left after an hour or so
8589172 you work pretty hard at a bakery and i think they were all expecting to cut loose with something more than good old fashioned fun and friendly company my manager dale actually asked me when the strippers were going to arrive
8589173 i didnt see why a group of guys couldnt get together to celebrate the most important day of a life without alcohol or naked women my friends from church and i were more than happy to enjoy each others company a pitcher of lemonade and a few songs
8589174 i realized that what my co workers thought of love and commitment wasnt anything like what i expected from adult relationships
8589175 i used to feel very uncomfortable placing hersheys kiss nipples on our old d cup cakes or using chocolate sprinkles to represent a womans pubic hair on our cherry poppin daddy napoleons but it did occur to me that what those customers were looking for was a cake or cookie to represent something they thought was missing from their adult relationships
8589176 surprisingly slow since mine is the first bakery within the city limits in the last seven years to not specialize in erotic theming
8589177 even safeway sells that vanilla cr me layer cake with the cupcake breasts on top
8589178 we appreciate hall of fame racing helping us get joey ready for 2009
8589179 they came to us with the idea before the august michigan race and we think its a great win win for all of us
8589180 the companies believe that this patent cross licensing agreement will substantially benefit customers of consumer products including digital cameras
8589181 both parties will be able to innovate openly with each others technologies enabling new features and products to come to market
8589182 the promise was made not only to malaysians but to the world that there will be no censorship of the internet in the country
8589183 google is planning to build a multibillion ringgit datacentre here if this is the way the commission behaves it is as good as telling google to please go away
8589184 it feels better even than when i was elected myself
8589185 all ill promise ya is that ill do my best for ya
8589186 every day i get a phone call to tell me whats for supper they will not have supper until i come in through the door
8589187 this has always been a very very solid tory district but it takes good candidates and good representation to deliver it for us
8589188 and kevin my son youve done us proud and i know youve done your parents proud
8589189 the ndp has become a credible choice for the electorate in cape st francis
8589190 obviously a deal of that magnitude the benefits are overwhelming for people especially on the avalon peninsula
8589191 whats important to them is that we are out there as the new democratic party showing what we believe in
8589192 if the people want to send you a message theres no time like a byelection
8589193 nilai nilai demokrasi sedang terancam tulisnya hanya sedikit pers yang memuat kronologi peristiwa yang sungguhnya bahwa semua bermula dari serbuan tentara georgia atas
8589194 liputan berita jauh dari fair dan berimbang terutama di hari hari pertama krisis kota tskhinvali terbakar ribuan penduduk mengungsi sampai tentara rusia datang menolong tapi rusia malah dituduh melakukan agresi dan liputan pers dipenuhi pernyataan tipuan dari pemimpin georgia
8589195 sekarang saya ragu apakah mereka masih percaya laporan pers amerika
8589196 ive gone from a to z with all kinds of emotions but i feel great i feel thankful
8589197 im excited to be part of the williams team part of the pc government i think it will bode well for the area and the whole province
8589198 there was some disillusionment there was some disenchantment there was some disgruntlement among the voters in that side of the bay
8589199 at the end of the day cooler heads prevailed and i think that issue is behind us
8589200 there is a tremendous need in this district for roadwork for infrastructure for economic development to continue in this area because this district the past 40 or 50 years has been rich in the mining logging and fishing industry and has generated much wealth to this region and to the entire province i think its about time for our district to get more than our fair share
8589201 4 82 artinya apakah mereka tak merenungkan secara mendalam mengenai quran itu seandainya ia berasal dari selain tuhan maka sudah pasti mereka akan menjumpai banyak pertentangan di dalamnya hal serupa juga ada pihak kristen dan juga yahudi saya banyak sekali menjumpai buku buku apologetika kristen juga yahudi yang menunjukkan adanya sejumlah pertentangan internal dalam quran
8589202 sorang muslim percaya bahwa kitab kitab sebelum quran bersumber dari tuhan yang sama
8589203 what i ask of the free thinker is that he should confront religion in the same mental state as the believer he who does not bring to the study of religion a sort of religious sentiment cannot speak about it he is like a blind man trying to talk about colour
8589204 all religions are relative that is limited partial incomplete one way of looking a think
8589205 to hold that any religions is intrinsically better than another is felt tobe somehow wrong offensif narrowminded

8589215 people were responding in unison in the middle leah daughtry a pastor and ceo of the democratic national convention committee spoke and said that despite what the media says democrats are people of faith
8589216 i stood up and said im a democrat but im not a person of faith i said this looks like a church service to me and i never thought i would see the democrats doing something like this
8589217 im not a career protester i just dont like religion mixed with politics its wrong and its dangerous

8589225 i came across two little black marsh fly puparia case of the pupa and kept them in jam jars on my desk expecting that adult marsh flies might hatch but what emerged were two different species of parasitic wasp
8589226 after resisting the temptation to name it after someone i know who really wants to be named after a parasite we settled on naming it mesoleptus hibernica in honour of the country where it was discovered
8589227 mud snails carry liverfluke and the larvae of marsh flies act as biological controls having a positive impact on the instances of liverfluke by keeping the snail populations down
8589228 any species impacting the marsh fly population will have a negative effect on the natural control that exists for the liverfluke carrying mud snails

8589232 the hawkish talks from the ecb members yesterday were as we see it just a statement from the central bank that the market should not anticipate any cuts this year
8589233 the downside of the robust german labor market is that it might add to the ecbs fears over a possible sharp pick up in wages growth
8589234 its from one of my top 10 favorite albums of all time
8589235 while watching a live video of them performing it it hit me that the melody and lyrics were something id write it fits my personality and seemed like a song that i could put myself into the only way i do covers is to somehow make them my own
8589236 it can certainly throw a spotlight on the bands own songs are they as well written or well put together sometimes thats why bands kind of shy away from doing a cover or they dont do it that often it can become the song everyones waiting to hear some people sort of take the attitude that id rather play our song than someone elses you know
8589237 pats attitude is that youre asking an audience for quite a bit to come in and listen to songs they may have never heard before youve put them through the paces of hearing everything you wrote theres nothing wrong with playing a song they know as long as it doesnt become the song youre known for that can become a problem
8589238 the guys who do that great fill in the blank with your favorite band cover
8589239 its not like a brand you have to carry around with you for the rest of existence
8589240 i dont know if it sums up your whole band it can if you let it but i dont think most bands do that most bands try a song because they love it
8589241 hes got the perfect voice for please come to boston
8589242 remember it now had hoshaw played that song instead of that twilight singers tune the sleepy older crowd would have hoisted him on their shoulders and paraded him around the water lily pond but i told teresa there was no way he would ever cover something so completely unhip
8589243 the status of a song being cool or not doesnt cross my mind ive covered toad the wet sprocket before and thats not cool i just pick songs i like and then work with them a lot of them i scrap because im not adding anything unique

8589248 and its main purpose is to help spread the message around with regards to web 2 0 enterprise 2 0 and social computing in general yes i know my kind of thing indeed
8589249 but i am thinking that i may be changing the title to something more like
8589250 much shorter straighter to the point on what i am doing lately as well as keeping that evangelism flavour that part of my job role entails we shall see how that goes
8589251 trip to germany see the light thinking out of the inbox
8589252 how could they know our child was ill and not tell the people who were in the best position to care for her if we knew we could have done something
8589253 these teachers just let her go on her christmas break with no protection and no support
8589254 it was a surprise to us when she died but these people knew she was unwell to us she looked like a picture of health she was perfect
8589255 we are aware of the complaint made by kasias parents which was thoroughly investigated at the time not just by the school and our governing body but also by ofsted and the department for children schools and families
8589256 on each occasion the finding was that the schools actions were entirely correct and in accordance with the legal ruling known as the gillick principal
8589257 if i had been diagnosed kasias life could have been saved because she would have been screened for the condition
8589258 need to look at it now and think if we dont do anything then in a decades time the idea of well resourced quality journalism with hundreds of journalists covering parliament and business and investigative journalism and the courts will be gone
8589259 whats at risk here is the role of well researched serious journalism to act as a check and balance in the system of democracy
8589260 online media can replace part of it the four websites im involved in employ 30 or 40 full time journalists which is quite a lot in independent media terms but compared with 300 or 400 journalists on big daily newspapers it is fairly small
8589261 we can cherrypick we can do the commentary and a little bit of investigative journalism and that kind of thing but i cant see a business model for independent journalism funding hundreds of journalists to do the bigger things that you have to do to fulfil the democratic mission
8589262 they didnt use those words and of course theyll deny that but by removing that number of journalists theyre saying their duty is to shareholders their duty is not to maintaining quality journalism and its place as the fourth estate

8589267 no formal notification has yet been received from either gmb or the unite union which also represents staff about any possible strike action
8589268 until we have heard formally from the recognised unions through the proper channels we will refrain from commenting on the potential for strike action except to reconfirm that we have had to take the possibility of escalated action seriously and have taken steps to prepare contingency plans that will maintain essential services to our customers in a similar manner as we have since the end of june when the current action began
8589269 in terms of the companys approach to the current pay round our position remains that we want to reach a reasonable settlement with our employees and that we do not regard a strike as the best way forward for either party
8589270 we consider that we have made a very reasonable offer in the shape of a two year deal with both years being worth more than rpi
8589271 given current inflation levels this makes the offer worth around 10 per cent over two years
8589272 the company considers that this offer is more than fair in the current economic climate and compares favourably with pay levels elsewhere in the region and with settlements for comparable groups elsewhere in the industry
8589273 the company is not prepared to put further pressure on customers electricity bills by conceding to unrealistic pay demands

8589286 we are going to stay in the fight and we have to stay active in order to prevail and not lose the initiative to the insurgents
8589287 do we have enough soldiers and policemen to control this province at this time the answer is no
8589288 this blatant disregard for human life is simply not acceptable
8589289 i am happy to report we that we have had very few civilian casualties as a result of our operations in kandahar province this year
8589290 we deeply regret any accidental loss of life that occurs as a result of our actions
8589291 the raid destroyed one of the largest ied factories to date within zhari panjwaii and seriously disrupted the insurgents ability to produce and deploy improvised explosive devices
8589292 there is no doubt many lives have been saved as a result of these operations

8589637 fertilizer costs doubled from a year ago while fuel increased 62 percent usda data show expenses probably will surpass the 279 2 billion that the usda estimated in february eroding net income the government pegged at a record 92 3 billion for 2008 farmers and economists said
8589638 while income is up from last year the price rally that began in 2006 for the nations biggest crops has sputtered since late june and early july on signs that midwest flooding may have caused less damage to corn and soybean plants than analysts had predicted
8589639 growers will probably spend one third more to plant their fields next year
8589640 fertilizer the second biggest expense for corn and soybean farmers after land is tied to spiraling energy costs said bob young chief economist for the american farm bureau federation
8589641 it will take 5 corn next year just to break even
8589642 u s soybean and corn futures rose more than 1 percent on wednesday as lack of rains in the u s midwest lent support along with strengthening crude oil prices
8589643 recently the weather has been bearish but now hot and dry weather is a support factor said shuji sugata a research manager at mitsubishi corp futures amp securities ltd in tokyo
8589644 the crude oil market is recovering and it is pulling soybeans and corn along he added
8589645 oil rose on tuesday as hurricane gustav churned through the caribbean and took aim at u s oil and natural gas installations in the gulf of mexico
8589646 crude prices affect agricultural commodities such as corn and soybeans because of their growing use in making biofuels
8589647 analysts said the u s soybean crop is vulnerable to damage from dry weather in the midwest as it is in the critical pod setting stage
8589648 the dollars past drop against other currencies has made u s goods cheaper abroad bolstering exports
8589649 amid fraying trade relations between moscow and washington russia said it would slash u s import quotas for chicken and pork both big export products to the region from the u s
8589650 after u s officials said russias war with georgia had cast doubt on russias bid to enter the world trade organization prime minister vladimir putin monday called for pulling out of trade deals that russia had signed when it was expecting quick admission into the trade body
8589651 then russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev said wednesday that moscow plans to reduce quotas for imports of chicken and pork by not tens but hundreds of thousands of tons
8589652 in 2005 the u s and russia entered into an agreement that allowed u s producers of poultry pork and beef to export a specified quantity of product to russia at a lower than usual tariff that agreement which was extended through 2009 was a way for russia to bolster its free trade credentials ahead of wto accession talks
8589653 any substantial cuts would likely have a significant impact on u s poultry producers for whom russia is the biggest market
8589654 overall russian purchases represented 7 percent of tysons total international sales of 3 8 billion which includes all its products not just chicken
8589655 tyson spokesman gary mickelson said russia has been an important market but he said the company has expanded its business in other regions such as china africa and the middle east so cutbacks by russia wouldnt hurt too much

8589658 world leaders should meet to try to break the deadlock that sank global trade talks in geneva last month french president nicolas sarkozy said on wednesday echoing similar calls from the united states and brazil
8589659 france europes biggest agricultural producer has been a vocal defender of european farm subsidies sarkozy had said during the geneva talks that the proposals on the table were unacceptable because europes trading partners were not offering enough in return for proposed cuts in eu subsidies
8589660 this angered eu trade commissioner peter mandelson who complained he was being undermined in his mission to represent the interests of the entire bloc
8589661 in the end the french position was not tested because the talks collapsed over a separate issue
8589662 luciano alves planted beans corn and grain on about 7 500 acres of his farm in southern brazil last year this year he is planting 8 600 acres and he credits brazils president luiz in cio lula da silva with the increase

8589664 rising food prices mean many farmers around the world are reaping record profits and south americas agricultural powerhouses brazil and argentina are responding to the farming windfall in opposite ways
8589665 worried about the wave of inflation rippling around the world the government of president cristina fern ndez de kirchner of argentina increased export taxes on some crops a move meant to keep down domestic food prices by encouraging farmers flush from global profits to sell more at home
8589666 in the race to take advantage of the tight global food market brazil has a number of advantages over its southern neighbor
8589667 the government in bras lia wants it to stay that way last month it announced a 49 billion credit line for farmers up 12 percent from last years total officials said farmers needed the credit to buy tractors and other machinery pay for seed and fertilizer which have also risen in price and to increase productivity
8589668 in argentina the kirchner administration tried to raise taxes on grain and soybean exports in line with rising world prices
8589669 but instead of reaping the windfall the government reaped a whirlwind of protest
8589670 while that wave of turmoil has subsided farmers said suspicion and uncertainty remain

8589726 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal

8589771 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8589772 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8589773 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8589774 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8589775 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

8589787 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8589788 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8589789 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8589790 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8589791 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8589792 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8589793 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8589794 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8589795 we took our time with this one because it was the first one but it went very well

8589798 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

8589807 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8589808 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8589809 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8589810 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8589811 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8589812 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8589813 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8589814 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8589815 on the most important national security issues of our time
8589816 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8589817 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8589818 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8589819 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8589820 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8589821 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8589822 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8589823 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8589824 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8589825 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8589826 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8589827 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8589828 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8589829 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8589830 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8589831 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8589832 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8589833 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8589834 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
