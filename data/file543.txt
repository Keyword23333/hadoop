5430002 while its about the lives of mr mandela and mrs parks the exhibit is really focused on trying to create an interactive experience for youth from around the world and provide an opportunity to write letters built on the shared values that they see in the two

5430032 big auto makers revving up efforts to electrify automobiles are taking shots at each others strategies in a style more familiar to silicon valley entrepreneurs than the auto industrys usually circumspect leaders the argument surfacing among auto industry leaders gathering for the tokyo motor show this week is over whether it is time to skip past partial electrification of cars represented by gasoline electric hybrids such as the toyota prius and push instead to revive the idea of an all electric car on one side are toyota motor corp and general motors corp both have played down all electric cars in favor of developing gasoline electric hybrids though they disagree on the best technology and how quickly it can be implemented on the other side are two allied car makers frances renault sa and japans nissan motor co as well as honda motor co the three have expressed skepticism about the economic wisdom of hybrids and are talking up all electric cars

5430038 if tesla decided to add a gas engine to one of their vehicles i for one will be rather disappointed

5430063 we gave the president that power to destroy iraqs weapons of mass destruction and if necessary to depose saddam hussein the wmd were not there saddam hussein is no longer there the 2002 authorization is no longer relevant to the situation in iraq we need a resolution that makes clear what the mission of our troops is
5430064 rudy giuliani today has taken the politics of fear to a new low and i believe americans are ready to reject those kind of politics americas mayor should know that when it comes to 9 11 and fighting terrorists america is united
5430065 the irony is rudy giuliani probably the most underqualified man since george bush to seek the presidency is here talking about any of the people here
5430066 rudy giuliani i mean think about it rudy giuliani theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 theres nothing else
5430067 the argument is that this was an ill conceived war not just a badly managed war
5430068 and biden whos got a long history of bipartisanship in the senate and deep ties to the institution would probably prove a pretty effective emissary when obama needs a couple more votes for this or that piece of legislation

5430093 im not sure if anybody understands what the hell is going on
5430094 it wasnt like i got second by three tenths or five tenths i had the same score thats what makes it a little harder to take
5430095 in other sports like track and field its all timed and it doesnt have anything to do with judging you do your routine and you turn it over to the judges thats what weve been going through our entire lives and weve come to accept it
5430096 shes an excellent athlete no matter how old she is
5430097 shes done her hard work and her preparation she definitely deserved her gold medal
5430098 i play by the rules so in my opinion i have to say yes

5430119 all americans myself included deeply respect sen mccains military service and sacrifice in the vietnam war
5430120 but most americans would be surprised and disappointed to find out that sen mccain has repeatedly voted against improved health care and benefits for millions of veterans
5430121 its difficult to understand how during a time of war that sen mccain can support massive tax cuts for exxon mobil and people making over 1 million a year while saying via his votes that we cannot afford to increase funding for veterans health care and benefits
5430122 i think despite his service distinguished service to our country his political record on veterans has been out of touch and often wrong

5430153 we cant hand over the car to an independent franchiser a traditional dealer would spend his time apologizing for the cars shortcomings rather than talking up the benefits we are going to design our own sales experience from scratch
5430154 tesla will own all its dealerships because the company wants complete control over the sales and service experience
5430155 the fact that he wants to take his customers on his self designed sales experience is the best part the retail car business has been attempting to put the customer into a certain buying experience for a lot longer than he has been

5430243 knowledge workers have the information they need readily available they can respond to the customers request immediately now this requires a whole lot of infrastructure on the back end to deliver this real time information but to have it is absolutely critical it empowers them to solve the customers needs

5430278 and all it took was forcing all men to wear girly clothes
5430279 the u s governments policy is creating millions of jobs all right but it is creating them in the peoples republic of china and vietnam at the expense of hardworking americans here at home
5430280 our country should be ashamed totally ashamed of what our government has done to working people in america
5430281 but for some reason it fails to see it with china
5430282 is in the midst of a crisis unprecedented since the great depression
5430283 deeply flawed u s trade policy toward domestic manufacturing is the single most important root cause of the illness every american deserves the right to provide for his family to own a home and to educate his kids but our flawed manufacturing and trade policies are taking this away
5430284 our constitutional preamble says a government of the people by the people and for the people
5430285 no manufacturer can compete when your competition is a foreign government determined to spend whatever it takes to force you out of the market and the u s government does nothing about it
5430286 their jobs are being moved overseas and they cant get other jobs
5430287 dont think there are high tech jobs available for those folks because there arent they are being shipped to china and india too if those who were laid off are lucky they have landed jobs flipping hamburgers or as a greeter at some retail store people are angry now and when they connect the dots and they are going to connect them they are going to know where to focus their anger
5430288 has been like a nightmare that we have had to face
5430289 meaning the rest of the world actually lost u s import market share
5430290 a flood of imports from china in products like the ones for which we used to make fabric is one of the main reasons why my home town of burlington has lost nearly 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001
5430291 picking up the pieces when our competitio n goes out of business
5430292 we pick up a piece and believe you me just as soon as you get into it here come the chinese again we look constantly for something that the chinese are not doing that they havent focused on yet we are looking constantly for something that may have some natural barrier to them coming over here but remember everybody in our industry is doing the same thing everybody there have been 550 000 jobs lost in my industry since 2001 alone
5430293 there are small towns where stores are closed with weeds growing up around them
5430294 but you know it is really bad when you see the churches closing
5430295 i will tell you that if this thing doesnt stop there will be no survivors
5430296 but what they havent realized yet is that people dont have any money
5430297 the reason they dont have any money is because they have lost their jobs or they now have jobs making a fraction of what their pay was before their jobs were exported if people had their manufacturing jobs they wouldnt have the economic problems and financial problems we now have
5430298 the united states will have much more difficulty ameliorating the pain an economic recession will inflict on its citizenry in a timely manner
5430299 it sounded like a good idea everybody is going to be okay but they left a loophole and its the loopholes that get us so many times the negotiato rs dont even know that the loopholes are there because they are some political appointee that hasnt done it but for about three or six months or they have been out of college for about a year and they dont even know the loopholes are there if they do know woe be to them let me tell you something
5430300 they had a deal in cafta to where they could take the pocketing for trousers that doesnt sound like much
5430301 we have got to start paying attention to what we are doing with these trade agreements we have to get some people who know what they are doing with these trade agre ements we are being out negotiated we better start paying attention to what we are doing because let me tell you something we are exporting the wealth of this country as fast as we can export it it is going offshore we are going to pay one tremendous price in this country
5430302 it has contributed to proven therapeutic treatments in thousands of patients with many different diseases its opening the prospect of new discoveries that could transform lives
5430303 congress has sent me a bill that would overturn this policy
5430304 if this legislation became law it would compel american taxpayers for the first time in our history to support the deliberate destruction of human embryos
5430305 i made it clear to congress and to the american people that i will not allow our nation to cross this moral line last year congress passed a similar bill i kept my promise by vetoing it and today im keeping my word again i am vetoing the bill that congress has sent
5430306 the quote that really caught my attention was i will not allow our nation to cross this moral line
5430307 he was very forthright about it very staunch no equivocation i think it really shows on the core issues this president really gets the pro life agenda
5430308 his veto today of a bill that would have led to dissection of young innocents in the name of suspect science solidifies his already strong record as one of our nations most pro life presidents
5430309 more than just saying no to using taxpayer funds as an incentive for destructive embryonic stem cell research though mr bush also signed an executive order to further encourage the development of ethical stem cell therapies

5430316 the wonder is that we can see these trees and not wonder more
5430317 when one tugs at a single thing in nature he finds it attached to the rest of the world
5430318 thank you father i want to do this well as far as finding a wife i cannot think of such a thing yet it might be a very long time
5430319 if aoife had not been attached to someone else when you met her you would have had a good marriage but it was not gods will i have heard how well you treated her and you will be blessed for that richard
5430320 it was not meant to be richard i will pray that you will find peace with this
5430321 what power did he have over her to make her unable to love me
5430322 it appears to me that feynman made an error with equation 10 there is a factor of 2 missing
5430323 the student in the front is right equation 10 is off by a factor of 2
5430324 finally we remark on the question of where we can get our supplies of energy today we have already obtained energy from uranium we can also get energy from hydrogen but at present only in an explosive and dangerous condition if it can be controlled in thermonuclear reactions it turns out that the energy that can be obtained from 10 quarts of water per second is equal to all the electrical power generated in the united states with 150 gallons of running water a minute you have enough fuel to supply all the energy which is used in the united states today therefore it is up to the physicist to figure out how to liberate us from the need for having energy it can be done
5430325 and i want to offer another prize if i can figure out how to phrase it so that i dont get into a mess of arguments about definitions of another 1 000 to the first guy who makes an operating electric motor a rotating electric motor which can be controlled from the outside and not counting the lead in wires is only 1 64 inch cube
5430326 we have to change the image of a battery stop thinking soda cans start thinking potato chip bags
5430327 equation 10 incident illustrates one reason feynman was a great scientist
5430328 have you heard of altairnano batteries they have very fast charge discharge and last forever
5430329 does anyone know why phoenix motors claims to have a less then 10minute charge time but tesla is about 3 hours this question seems to come up nearly every blog entry it sure would be nice to have a faq addressing it
5430330 akin to the gas tank access behind the license plate cover in day of old
5430331 will it be possible to provide the option of varying between performance and range via slider control knob fixed point selections etc
5430332 you guys arent going to get 200 miles at all
5430333 will it be possible to provide the option of varying between performance and range via slider control knob fixed point selections etc
5430334 the contribution of the social science to the energy challenge
5430335 solving our nations energy challenge will depend on a combination of technological innovation and behavior change
5430336 this committee and this congress have held countless hearings on the energy technologies of tomorrow what we dont talk about is behavior and how changes in behavior can start making a big dent in our energy challenges today
5430337 i understand that it is very challenging to determine why people do what they do regarding energy given all the variables in their lives
5430338 if congress creates what looks like good policy but which lacks an understanding of the primary drivers of decision making our policies may still fail we must account for social factors when crafting energy policies
5430339 the truth is that the typical consumer doesnt have the information he or she needs to factor energy use into purchases and behaviors and the government and industry have fallen far short in providing or communicating the needed information to the public in a way that will result in behavior changes
5430340 these efforts not only improve the bottom line of a wide variety of industries they enhance the quality of life for american workers families and the communities they serve
5430341 in my home state of texas especially there is significant pressure to reduce the emissions and energy use associated with their processes while keeping costs low enough to maintain the regions attractiveness to industry
5430342 thats a tall order when costs for natural gas one of the primary industrial feedstocks are among the highest in the country
5430343 we pump more energy into our factories than we do into our vehicles
5430344 increasing u s industry efficiency will reduce emissions drive down energy costs enabling domestic companies to compete internationally and transfer energy cost savings to the consumer
5430345 dictum form part of the persuasive argument for a case but are not officially called precedent and do not form part of the common law
5430346 a few years ago there was lots of noise about voip and lots of hype now we have made the vision into reality we are bringing the two most important things together telephones and customer information
5430347 i think that a lot of firms are realising this time around that they need to invest and continue to invest
5430348 when you look at the uk chamber of commerce the confidence level among members is low but advisers to the sme market are coming out to say that this is the time to look at voip
5430349 we know about crm and we know about helpdesk were making it easy for people to integrate its very much on the things that we looked at closely integration with other applications is very important a lot of people go to the suite vendors because they are looking for that ready made integration thats the appoach that weve been taking we see best of breed as a sustainable approach
5430350 it seems to be going quicker in europe than in the us
5430351 your adoption of technology is getting quicker than the us i think you guys have seen that you have to stay ahead of the competition and the way to do that is to adapt and adopt technology by being proactive
5430352 a lot of firms are realising this time around that they need to invest and continue to invest theyve learned from the past that cutting back just makes it harder to come out the other side and continue
5430353 one of the reasons that people dont adopt technology is that it takes too long to get information out of them
5430354 we talk about action oriented architecture which makes it easier for people to pull out information if i go to manchester to see one customer can i check out and see who are the other prospects that are up there and arrange to go and see them how can i drill down and see who is interested in what products or services thats another area that were looking at how to gather data to do predictive modelling for the sme
5430355 personally i think its a fad but we are looking at this very closely to make sure that this is not a false assumption on our part
5430356 actually we have had some customers recently who have come back to us from salesforce com because of the recurring costs
5430357 as for microsoft they went out and got every partner in the world signed up another aspect of it is the old dont get fired for buying from ibm thing you dont get fired for buying from microsoft
5430358 people will say you dont want me to have this application and ask questions we had a salesperson join us from a microsoft partner and he said that one issue was that they didnt get much support from microsoft we provide leads out to our partners and we have a sales team who can go out and help partners to complete on sales
5430359 rather than taking the approach that mainframes are all ugly and dead and were going to get off of them
5430360 how do i take these functional working applications and how do i move them forward to meet functional demands that are different from when those applications were built
5430361 first and foremost you have to understand the number of applications you have and how they all fit together
5430362 what organizations need to do is take advantage of internal applications and concentrate on a new external focus
5430363 i feel like i am in a whirlwind mother the last few weeks have been emotionally draining and now my life doesnt seem real like i could wake up at any moment

5430370 some car dealers who run loans through the credit union have indicated that they are not comfortable doing business with the credit union until the strike is over
5430371 it would be difficult to limit their banking needs but we are certainly giving strikers all the support we can we are disappointed that this strike had to happen that it was let go this far
5430372 cornerstone and union negotiators reached a tentative agreement later rejected by union membership that would continue to provide employees with a more than competitive benefits package including single and family health insurance coverage for full time employees and a 401 k retirement plan
5430373 cornerstone asked its employees to pay a small portion of health insurance costs which rose 53 percent between 2004 and 2008 by contributing five percent of the monthly health insurance premium starting in november 2009

5430388 he discussed this briefly with his friend on the fbi his friend told him that the toxin is indeed a deadly poison but in the short run it can act like a vitamin supplement
5430389 in the tenth year of his ministrations while he was out walking the sidewalk he was shot by a drive by gunman who was aiming at the person directly behind him

5430420 the recharge energy of 31kwh 100mi is the electricity you pay for from the grid to recharge your roadster it works out to 75kwh of alternating current ac for a full recharge our ess battery produces direct current dc and holds 53kwh the difference between these two numbers is due to charging inefficiencies including the use of air conditioning to thermally manage the battery during charging
5430421 it works out to 75kwh of alternating current ac for a full recharge our ess battery produces direct current dc and holds 53kwh
5430422 the recharge efficiency is a complex function of many factors such as the charging rate e g 4hrs vs 12hrs the supply voltage e g 220v vs 240v and the temperature of your battery when you start charging it is not always true that slower charging is more efficient

5430436 but i was always taught not to waste everyones lunch hour with on screen account balances
5430437 she didnt even make a pretence of looking away from the keypad what kind of barbarian is this woman
5430438 but she looked at the atm like shed never seen one before i swear she stared at the screen for 30 seconds before typing in her number shameless
5430439 as if that was not bad enough the insufferable lout tucked everything back into her purse before walking off
5430440 i thought she was finally doing the honourable thing and selecting the no receipt option
5430441 but just as i was about to step forward and insert my card she went back to the machine without a word of apology mind you turns out the discourteous lady just forgot to grab it
5430442 by the time she was done with her unconscionable rudeness five more people had joined the line that woman cost me literally eight minutes of my life
5430443 we installed atms to make things easier and more convenient for our customers its just a shame some people have no concept of using well mannered behaviour to disguise the fact theyre complete arseholes
5430444 may i speak with aoife in the other room please your highness aoife would you mind talking with me for a moment
5430445 father please forgive me for what i am about to tell you
5430446 i am afraid i may be with child i wasnt sure before but now i am confident that i am
5430447 your circumstances are surely troubling when your father made me aware of the marriage between you and lord de clare i did worry about this being a probability
5430448 you need to tell your father and lord de clare the truth let them decide if this marriage should go forth with your recent revelation
5430449 my father will be furious and i will be shamed by everyone
5430450 perhaps lord de clare will not want to take me as a wife if he knew i am carrying another mans child
5430451 i will get your mother for you god will be with you aoife
5430452 your majesty i would really like to proceed with this i hope this isnt going to be a regular occurrence with your daughter i really like aoife but i dont have the patience for this this wedding will go through right
5430453 i do have something i wish to speak with you about although i dont know how to say it because i am terribly ashamed
5430454 whatever it is aoife you can certainly confide in us we love you
5430455 i have already spoken to father flanagan about it about three or four weeks ago something happened between finn and i we knew it was a mistake but it just happened i have no explanation for it
5430456 now i am most assured that i am with child as a result of that night
5430457 oh my dear aoife whatever shall we do now no he doesnt we talked about the possibility of it
5430458 mother do you think strongbow would want to marry me if he knew maybe this is my saving grace
5430459 in all respect your highness i feel that would be in her best interest that she be honest and forthcoming

5430461 yes it is and its everything ive ever wanted in a car
5430462 the engine and transmission of a conventional car also need lubricating oils filters coolant clutches spark plugs and wires a pcv valve oxygen sensors a timing belt a fan belt a water pump and hoses a catalytic converter and a muffler all items requiring service and all items that arent needed in an electric car
5430463 according to phil luk the tesla engineer who hand built each prototype the battery is equipped with 13 separate processors that monitor everything from voltage and temperature to smoke levels to maintain appropriate temperatures inside the battery the car includes both heating and a liquid cooling system and that wasnt a joke the cooling vents in the rear of the car work much like the cooling vents on an ordinary desktop pc
5430464 under the hood youll find only the radiator and an air conditioning unit the one used to cool the passengers
5430465 following the incident involving kimi raikkonen and paul henri cahier on the starting grid of the british grand prix in silverstone that saw the finnish driver assault the photographer we decided that it was necessary to clarify a few points there never was any contact between the two men nor did paul henri ever touch kimis equipment furthermore the distance at which paul henri cahier was taking a picture although close was completely standard the photographers who take pictures at grand prix races are all professionals who have been accredited by the fia and as the dozen other photographers who were standing next to paul henri cahier prove there was nothing unusual or unethical about this situation finally paul henri cahier has been an f1 photographer for almost fourty years and has been close to the greatest champions but none of them has ever behaved in such a rude manner it is understandable that drivers might get irritable because of the pressure they undergo but kimi raikkonen never even attempted to express his discontent in a non violent way paul henri cahier luckily did not suffer any injury and so does not intend to take any action but he regrets the arrogance with which kimi raikkonen treated someone who was merely doing his job

5430472 we have also done away with the need for an electric oil pump and instead integrated a very efficient gear driven oil pump into the gearbox
5430473 along with improved efficiency the 1 5 powertrain will have improved thermal performance over the 1 0 powertrain at all common operating points this is due to the efficiency of the pem motor and gearbox and also due to the slightly increased gear ratio increased by about 12 from 7 4 1 to 8 27 1 this gear ratio change will reduce motor current by about the same ratio 12 for a given vehicle operating point and this will reduce the thermal load on the motor and pem
5430474 one of the most exciting features of this new gearbox from an ev perspective is that it has extremely low spinning drag less than 0 1 nm of dry drag torque this is less than any other gearbox we have tested with the only possible exception being the ev1 gearbox

5430495 ok i pay 4 and get 40 miles thats 10 a mile for a 40 mpg car that 10 would get me 5 miles and the 4 would get me 200 miles so the tesla is a 200 mpg car

5430521 i recognize there may be economic and strategic benefits of advancing coal to liquid technologies from both the regional and global perspectives we need to have a comprehensive strategy to build an energy future that is sustainable
5430522 todays hearing was very informative and underscored the benefits of coal to liquid fuels in the near term and the need for greater federal investment in developing carbon capture and sequestration technologies
5430523 i am aware that there are significant environmental challenges associated with using coal to produce liquid fuels i believe it is essential that we continue to examine our energy strategies with attention to the issue of global warming and other environmental concerns such as management of our water resources
5430524 editors comment it is also a match made in heaven for the editor who is a big fan of top gear

5430530 you think that ev s are slow and clumsy not anymore
5430531 i must confess that i did expect to see yet another golf cart but i must say that this car is fun
5430532 a real important distinction is that once off the starting line a tesla roadster can probably stay in 2nd gear the whole time making it a lot easier to get the performance this is a user friendly feature but it wont make much difference for a skilled track driver
5430533 i dont think its ideological it was more operational i suppose
5430534 i met with my whole sports car club over the weekend and the new attitude toward tesla is interesting we were all rooting for the company to succeed and many of us were ready to plop down the cash to buy one of these cars now everyone is talking about how they hope the company falls apart as a lesson to high tech idiot managers and vcs who think that their egos are above right and wrong its one thing to make a business decision but its a whole different game when decisions are made based on peoples egos and the need for an easy scapegoat i hope the press picks up on this one and does some stories about how crappy ego centric management will lead to underperforming businesses

5430537 you really think you could have a 5hp generator in a large heavy family sedan and make it maintain good highway speed as long as the fuel lasted
5430538 1 they are not the best for long range highway efficiency because you run the ice through a generator then to an emotor which wastes some power
5430539 hey they plan to drive more than 40 miles and then start going uphill on the freeway i better fire up the ice generator right away to keep the battery charge ready for the uphill later in the trip
5430540 you really think you could have a 5hp generator in a large heavy family sedan and make it maintain good highway speed as long as the fuel lasted
5430541 tesla may have talent but a future hypothetical martin amp co could hire them away now i see nothing much to potentially going forward differentiate tesla from all the other car makers working on evs or plug in hybrids including gm with guys like lutz
5430542 differentiate tesla from all the other car makers working on evs or plug in hybrids including gm with guys like lutz
5430543 yes a range extending turbine engine might be a great trickle source for efficient energy conversion
5430544 that means it needs to provide full power for acceleration too and lower power when full power is not needed that makes it low energy efficiency engine with variable rpm just like any other ordinary ice
5430545 that means it needs to provide full power for acceleration too and lower power when full power is not needed that makes it low energy efficiency engine with variable rpm just like any other ordinary ice
5430546 peak efficiency will be at around 30 kw which is what the car should require at 65 mph slightly uphill
5430547 run the ice while i am away to recharge the batteries
5430548 oh that is not a problem dont worry about it
5430549 the main problem of all ht systems is the thermal self discharge which however can be compensated by internal resistivity losses joule heat when the battery is used frequently the na s battery has an additional problem of low thermal cycling capability i e the battery can be heated up and cooled down only a few times

5430552 several of you have suggested installing a gasoline or other fuel generator in the trunk of a tesla car as a range extender such a feature would convert the tesla car into a form of plug in hybrid note that the gasoline engine for such a hybrid car has to be pretty much as big as a car engine since it ultimately must power the car by itself when the batteries are exhausted dont think about that 1 cylinder 1 kw honda generator you can buy at home depot think prius engine at least
5430553 dont think about that 1 cylinder 1 kw honda generator you can buy at home depot think prius engine at least
5430554 tesla motors will remain focused on building the best electric cars for the foreseeable future with each passing year our driving range will get longer and the argument for plug in hybrids will get weaker to hell with gasoline

5430558 rj correct i think the price that were envisioning is under 30 000 thats our goal and i think you know its doable
5430559 it is simple physical fact that solar energy is not enough for decent car performance even with 100 efficiency and best that solar panels can achieve is somewhere around 40
5430560 at present photovoltaic panels typically convert about 15 percent of incident sunlight into electricity therefore a solar panel in the contiguous united states on average delivers 19 to 56 w m or 0 45 1 35 kwh m day
5430561 silicon is an attractive anode material for lithium batteries because it has a low discharge potential and the highest known theoretical charge capacity 4 200 mah g 1 ref 2 although this is more than ten times higher than existing graphite anodes and much larger than various nitride and oxide materials silicon anodes have limited applications because silicons volume changes by 400 upon insertion and extraction of lithium which results in pulverization and capacity fading

5430582 i study engines all day and i know everything about them
5430583 tesla are planning to build their next car in the states so theyre obviously ready to face high labour costs for that one
5430584 it is clear that we need to restore confidence in our astronaut program and there are three ways we can accomplish that goal
5430585 first we need to ensure that nasa carries out the recommended thorough and anonymous survey second i want nasa to come forward with a credible plan to implement the panels recommendations finally i would like to see nasa provide us with a specific timetable for implementing the panels recommendations
5430586 although the astronauts and family members interviewed do not represent a random or exhaustive sample of the larger population the issues they raised during these unstructured interviews were remarkably consistent and compelling and deserve focused action
5430587 major vulnerabilities underlying root causes and contributing factors extend well beyond the specific medical aspects of nasa operations many of the cultural and structural issues identified in the report have existed for many years pre dating the current leadership team are deeply ingrained and will take senior leadership action to remediate them
5430588 many anecdotes were related that involved risky behaviors by astronauts that were well known to the other astronauts and no apparent action was taken peers and staff fear ostracism if they identify their own or others problems
5430589 several senior flight surgeons expressed their belief that their medical opinions regarding astronaut fitness for duty flight safety and mission accomplishment were not valued by leadership other than to validate that all medical systems were
5430590 as the review progressed it became apparent that major vulnerabilities underlying root causes and contributing factors extend well beyond the specific medical aspects of nasa operations these issues are so ingrained and longstanding that it will take senior leadership action to remediate them
5430591 there is no periodic psychological evaluation or testing conducted on astronauts once selected as an astronaut candidate astronauts have no psychological evaluation for the remainder of their careers unless selected for long duration missions
5430592 i dont think anyone can listen to those findings and think all is well with nasas astronaut health care system
5430593 col bachmann and his review committee have done nasa and the nation a service in identifying a number of issues that need attention and in offering recommendations to improve nasas astronaut health care system
5430594 nasa certainly doesnt have to agree with all of those findings and recommendations but i hope that the agency will take them seriously
5430595 reported allegations of heavy use of alcohol by astronauts in the immediate pre space flight period
5430596 i cannot say such events have never happened i just was unable to verify that they did happen
5430597 we understand the outrage that some members of nasa have expressed at the alcohol findings in the july report the fact remains that the incidents described in the report that have generated so much concern and anger were told to the committee voluntarily by nasa personnel who were eyewitnesses to the incidents nasa must ensure that people can identify such safety and human performance concerns within nasa without fear of reprisal or career injury public statements that such things are simply impossible challenging the veracity of these findings rather than acknowledging how difficult raising such concerns can be do not encourage openness and safety
5430598 peers and staff fear ostracism if they identify their own or others problems
5430599 there are a number of subjective decisions we have to make concerning the regen profile
5430600 a torque command is derived from the position of the throttle pedal
5430601 the regen torque profile to achieve the goals within the constraints
5430602 it should be possible to continue regenerative braking when the batteries are full by diverting the excess power to a resistance bank cooled by a fan
5430603 magical new components someone has always just come out with a magic motor a better battery or some other holy grail that will give you amazing range and power weighs almost nothing produces more power than it uses and cures cancer on closer inspection you will find that these fantasy components are hand built laboratory prototypes they also have a few drawbacks like enormous price tags 600f operating temperatures or a tenancy to self destruct someday some of these fairy tales will come true and will benefit us all in the meantime it is foolish to base your vehicle on the magic of tomorrow if you do your dream coach and four will remain a lumpy pumpkin pulled by white mice build with available technology today you can always upgrade later
5430604 driving dynamics part 2 why tesla doesnt hub motors without friction brakes is i believe also not road legal in us so no us market for them and it might be that several european countries have this same restriction
5430605 im hoping that the tesla people rethink the whitestar name
5430606 btw china is also building small electric vehicles so i will buy the first one that gets over here costa rica even if its chinese
5430607 im hoping that the tesla people rethink the whitestar name it sounds like a kitchen appliance to me it needs a more up to date and catchy name for example look at the honda fit
5430608 whitestar is just being used in developement the roadster was called the darkstar when it was at the same point in developement nobody expects that name to last even to the first prototypes
5430609 the vast majority of the kinetic energy is converted into heat by your brake pads when you stomp on the brakes
5430610 there are some who would prefer the regen to be tied to the application of the brake pedal
5430611 the tesla roadster has regenerative braking but it works differently than the typical hybrid hybrids apply regen braking when the driver steps on the brake pedal the tesla roadster applies variable regen braking based on accelerator position
5430612 if you take your foot off the throttle pedal put it on take it off put it on take it off etcetera energy will be converted from kinetic to potential many times with only about 80 efficiency each time
5430613 in the real world i have a porsche carrera gt i have a mclaren f1 and anybody that tells you theyve taken those cars to 200mph is a liar they havent believe me i did a couple of hundred laps at talladega and the fastest i got to was 190mph on a track by myself and it was scary nobody does those speeds on a public road if you do you should be in prison the real world fun of acceleration is between 40mph and 80mph
5430614 when i test drove the phoenix sut last month the regenerative braking was set on very high you can let go of the pedal and the truck will slow immediately
5430615 never because we dont really know what it does exactly
5430616 the only time the physical brakes are used by preference is during a panic stop when the pedal is suddenly slammed down the system senses this fast rate of change and immediately brings in the hydraulic brakes for faster and safer stopping with all four wheels
5430617 all regeneration quits at less than 6 or 7 mph when the motors arent turning fast enough to provide useful power
5430618 if you do not feel like shifting you can drive entirely in second gear acceleration even in second gear is remarkably fast
5430619 all of this talk about the way things should be is irrelevant tesla already made their decision for the roadster
5430620 the problem is for those drivers coming from auto transmission cars
5430621 imagine america becoming the leader in global warming prevention show video of pristine forests lakes and mountains etc
5430622 you no longer need to imagine introducing the revolutionary next generation of vehicles
5430623 ah but there is only one battery and if this fails or if a main fuse blows the vehicle cannot stop
5430624 editors answer intentional yes desirable perhaps not we are all a little busy
5430625 they were used 10 years ago for the ev 1 and the toyota rav 4 and they had a range greater than the 40 miles for all electric mode that they are advertising for the volt
5430626 a wind turbine on the car will always increase the aerodynamic drag and the energy it produces will never be as much as the additional energy needed by the drive motor to overcome the wind turbines drag
5430627 due to regenerative braking even the friction brakes will encounter little wear the only service that a well designed electric car will need for the first 100 000 miles is tire service and inspection
5430628 why not simply have 3 brake pedals in place of the normal one
5430629 roy wrote on august 4th 2007 at 7 20 am matt there is no point to such a calculator 3 gal at 30mpg and 60000 price difference 600 000 miles you will never be able to justify the purchase of a tesla roadster on the basis of economy alone
5430630 does tesla have a calualator somewhere so i can see how much time it will take for a tesla to pay for itself over say a 35 000 suv that gets so many mpg
5430631 if detroit spent more money on engineering and less on lawyers lobbying theyd be better off
5430632 the stone age ended not for a lack of stones and so shall the worlds dependence on oil
5430633 the stone age ended not for a lack of stones and so shall the worlds reliance on oil
5430634 a nuclear power plant uses much less fuel than a comparable fossil fuel plant a rough estimate is that it takes 17 000 kilograms of coal to produce the same amount of electricity as 1 kilogram of nuclear uranium fuel
5430635 wouldnt put it past them that the oil industry was in on the act with their car making buddies in detroit
5430636 this is going to be easy and when the government sees what we have developed they will encourage our efforts with a plethora of support and incentives
5430637 climate change is the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen
5430638 i think a lot of people fear nuclear power because they dont understand it or because theyve been told to fear it because of chernobyl and three mile island
5430639 diablo canyon on the hosgri fault which lies about 3 miles offshore of the plant
5430640 we at tesla motors are naturally supportive of the most aggressive increases in cafe possible
5430641 such gambles could be justified only in case if no feasible solution exist at all
5430642 we think that in the absence of a meaningful sin tax on gas increasing cafe is the most effective way to reduce petroleum dependence and greenhouse gas emissions
5430643 since there is no way we could have what we really want well have to settle for
5430644 according to this in the 2nd to last paragraph tesla is considering a small gasoline engine in its 3rd model referred to as the blue star in order to boost range and broaden appeal
5430645 well we do something thats bad but so does everyone else
5430646 if you spend 20 billions dollars on solar plants we could not even guess as to the efficiency increases or cost decreases
5430647 there are at least three innovative approaches to nuclear fusion that are being researched today though none of them are getting much funding support a fact that causes me a great deal of frustration
5430648 motel 6 up on the moon or the effort from china to do the same any guess as to want the next war for power will be over
5430649 the iec polywell reactor and the focus fusion reactor should in theory be able to support an advanced fuel cycle fusing boron 11 ions with protons its an aneutronic reaction

5430663 behind the buyouts private equity owned companies in times square
5430664 the top 20 private equity firms alone control companies that employ nearly 4 million workers industry analysts say a 100 billion private equity buyout deal is not out of the question putting huge companies such as dell boeing and apple in the range of the buyout industry
5430665 tesla will buy the batteries from one or more japanese suppliers the japanese market share leaders are sanyo sony matsus hita nec and hitachi
5430666 the roadster can handle charge from a 110 or 220 volt circuit and be adjusted to charge at rates between 15 amps and 70 amps this can take anywhere from 3 5 hours 70 amps at 220 v to over 24 hours 15 amps at 110 v in both cases the charger itself is on board there is no required charging infrastructure for the car other than access to the grid
5430667 the government is going to intervene no matter what any of us think

5430671 how is urging the government to increase its control over an aspect of the auto industry increasing cafe standards and creating an artificial market in credits for instance achieving that goal
5430672 now tell me any industrial technical facility in continuous operation for 300 years any historical example it does not exist because industry as a whole barely could count that duration so it is extremely hard to believe that 300 years of smooth operation is possible may be so but it is what i call a gamble

5430685 would four hub mounted motors have made for a better tesla roadster
5430686 at its core there has been a philosophy of kiss keep it simple stupid
5430687 the engineers would have been compromising the handling of the car by mounting heavy hub mounted motors drastically increasing the unsprung mass at each of the four corners
5430688 isnt the ess liquid cooled wont this cause liquid that can slosh

5430692 roger wrote on june 13th 2007 at 4 33 am general question to anyone whos spent quality time with a lightweight high performance exotic is there actually a noticeable change in handling or performance between driving with a full tank of gas versus a nearly empty one given that with an empty tank the cars 100 or so pounds lighter id imagine that thered be measurable changes but im just curious as to whether that translates into anything a driver would feel
5430693 i am now convinced i need to take out the back seat and place the batteries in front of the rear axle
5430694 just like its predecessors the murci lago lp640 features permanent four wheel drive based on the reliable lamborghini vt viscous traction system the system is self governing and does not feature any electronic controls the drive force is usually divided between the front and rear axles in the ratio of 30 to 70 an independent control circuit adjusts the distribution of the drive force depending on dynamic oscillation weight distribution and the relative friction factor in perfect synchronization with the visco clutch in extreme cases up to 100 of the drive force can be applied to a single axle
5430695 type 72 1970 to 1975 the most successful formula one race car ever raced the lotus 72 used variable rate torsion bar springs at both front and rear front inboard disc brakes the continuation of the wedge aerodynamic bodywork multiple element rear wing and side radiators today nearly every formula car uses these elements introduced by the lotus 72 the lotus 72 won 3 worlds constructors championships and 2 drivers championships and is the only formula one race car to have won 20 grand prix races

5430698 an added benefit of effective regenerative braking is reduction in brake wear at 85 000 km the original equipment front brake pads were less than 30 worn this wear rate will yield pad life of over 280 000 km 175 000 mi essentially the life of the vehicle
5430699 nimh ev that is a great suggestion and the nice thing about using pml flightlink inboard is that you would not even need any brakes 100 regen like on their mini their approach looks really nice actually
5430700 or pml is using batteries that accept a very fast rate of charge
5430701 since engine is into back and battery is into middle i dont know what is all that stuff in front
5430702 tesla says that although the roadsters batteries add 25 percent to the weight of the elongated elise the weight distribution is still 40 60 front to rear
5430703 on the energy usage screen it listed a little over 400w mile was this number just higher because it was the last instantaneous power or perhaps because of the agressive driving that was being done during the demonstration
5430704 the innovative combination of a torotrak variator providing mechanical efficiency that should be in excess of 90 per cent with a flywheel of advanced construction results in a highly efficient and compact energy storage system whilst xtrac will supply variator units to its customers the flywheels for these energy recovery systems are being developed separately by the formula 1 teams themselves and their specialist suppliers torotrak will provide the control system expertise torotrak and xtrac believe that the variator flywheel solution provides a significantly more compact efficient lighter and environmentally friendly solution than the traditional alternative of electrical battery systems
5430705 the system supports the current trend in powertrain design for engine downsizing by providing a means of boosting acceleration overall performance and economy independently of the vehicles engine and without the need for complex electrical battery hybrid architectures
5430706 i think it would have been nice to avoid the sales experience other car dealers are known for and not try and make crazy profits on add ons that should be included

5430715 the support comes directly from the experts who created spring you cant get any better than that for timely and accurate resolution of the kinds of problems we see on a daily basis in the software development process
5430716 better energy storage technologies will also enable us to operate electric utilities in a more flexible and efficient manner energy storage can also help us respond to power outages more efficiently providing greater electricity reliability this could be vital for maintaining operations at critical facilities such as hospitals during a natural disaster
5430717 energy storage is also critical for the next generation of vehicles which will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil and lower greenhouse gas emissions
5430718 i also think public private partnerships can improve the production process for advanced vehicle components so that the u s becomes a leader in manufacturing these breakthrough technologies with so many benefits of energy storage technologies i think additional federal investment to research test and advance these systems should be a priority
5430719 with both stationary and mobile energy storage we cannot let an opportunity to establish a domestic manufacturing base for these technologies pass us by and unfortunately we may already be losing this race new r amp d activities with the department of energy are critical to advancing energy storage technologies and we should pursue this aggressively to ensure u s participation in this field
5430720 we believe that with continued engineering advances and appropriate public policy support the widespread use of advanced batteries in plug in vehicles and in stationary storage applications will become one of the nations most effective strategies in the broader effort to address energy security reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce air pollutants
5430721 i passionately believe that electrification of the vehicle powertrain in part or in whole can make a dominant contribution to americas energy security and transportation sustainability electric powertrains by nature are incredibly more efficient than their internal combustions counterparts

5430726 it is important that people understand how the oversight work of congress can feed directly into improving the law so that we dont have to keep repeating the same mistakes over and over
5430727 mr cobb may not leave of his own free will in this congress and the president does not seem to care that cobb has lost the confidence of the house and senate but we can at least improve the process by which igs are chosen in the future and expand the grounds for their removal

5430741 she is too young she isnt considering that yet i am sure
5430742 she is almost sixteen and he is already seventeen years old you were married and had almaith by then
5430743 isnt this the most beautiful place i love coming here
5430744 it is very nice they must have a lot of money to have so much land
5430745 i would love to have a home like this someday did you see all of ryannes wares she has the nicest furniture and wall hangings she even has a servant
5430746 i just think it would be nice to sit in chairs rather than a bench or have fish and meat every night instead of barley porridge and bread
5430747 everyone would like that almaith but we settle for what we have
5430748 i have been thinking a lot lately about our life after we are married
5430749 i meant how we will live once we are married
5430750 we will live like we have always lived only we will be together
5430751 yes but where how will we eat have you thought about what you will do once you leave the abbey
5430752 well no i havent given it much thought almaith i guess i figured i would always take care of the abbey either that or run a farm someday i dont know really i thought you said you couldnt leave your father anytime soon
5430753 i will have to someday i am getting older i am sure he will expect it sometime
5430754 we should get back to the cottage supper is probably ready
5430755 well you better walk fast or well start lunch without you

5430766 we also believe that third party maintenance has its strongest appeal to customers who are at the end of lifecycle for legacy applications and that does not apply to the bulk of sap applications
5430767 in the end sap decided theyre in the software business
5430768 this is saps way to rid itself of a troubled subsidiary as well as a problematic lawsuit
5430769 clearly there was impropriety saps only hope is to settle the lawsuit quickly and avoid becoming connected with the allegations
5430770 they are still going to need some sort of interim cushion support strategy so they can keep their applications up and running until they can get to the next step
5430771 i think third party support is a viable business model provided they dont run afoul of intellectual property rights

5430784 americas education system has not been accountable for results and too many children have been locked in underachieving schools and left behind testing will raise expectations for all students and ensure that no child slips through the cracks
5430785 rigorous testing that decides whether students graduate teachers win bonuses and schools are shuttered an approach already in place in more than half the nation does little to improve achievement and may actually worsen academic performance and dropout rates
5430786 what happens is you create a situation where there are so many schools failing that there is no support for them the administration likes to talk about the soft bigotry of low expectations and how this law fights that but what about the hard bigotry of high expectations without adequate resources

5430788 more transportation fuel energy will be used to transport the increased mass of the obese population which will increase even further if as is likely the overweight people in response to their increased body mass choose to walk less and drive more
5430789 we throw away far more food that the extra 460 calories per day they point out
5430790 in other words most of our food overproduction is due to waste not overeating it is estimated that one fourth of the food produced in the u s goes to waste
5430791 does having 50 extra pounds in a chevy tahoe really affect gas mileage i do not think so

5430800 it should really say commonwealth tesla he died a poor man in a new york manhattan hotel
5430801 could this car recycle the energy supplied by the recharged battery
5430802 this additional energy will be more than the generators produce
5430803 at least the second battery is somehow recharged with energy which is enough power to supply the car to move any further
5430804 there is no doubt that a highly successful machine can be produced on these lines the field is inexhaustible and this new type of automobile introducing electricity between the prime mover and the wheels has in my opinion a great future
5430805 zeroshift technology is a seamless instantaneous means of changing gear ratios without interrupting the engine torque to the wheels

5430809 speculation that they could use dilithium crystals in the e flex
5430810 for all the hoopla nobody yet has figured out how to make a small enough battery that will hold a big enough charge for these new cars and not be a risk to burst into flames
5430811 but the most promising technology lithium ion batteries like the ones used in laptop computers and cellphones has been plagued by problems
5430812 earlier this week for example the battery in a laptop made by a south korean firm burst into flames u s transportation authorities rececently said air travelers will no longer be allowed to pack loose lithium ion batteries in checked luggage
5430813 car makers cant very well sell vehicles that might ignite and burn up grandma and two kids sitting on half a ton of batteries in the car
5430814 any bean counter paper pusher lawyer literature arts majors or other freeloaders who does not know how to enjoy a clutch should be prohibited from owning a tesla by law
5430815 gm volts contract with a123 prohibits a123 selling high density 32157 batteries to anybody but gm
5430816 because the spec tries to confuse the public by using the term equivalent mpg
5430817 because it results in a false implication about the overall energy usage and the global warming implications shame on gm
5430818 there is not much chance of electricity from these sources getting into the car batteries
5430819 well retrofit all the initial cars as needed with the final transmission which is also a one speed
5430820 ive been watching the motor trend vp9 launches on youtube and it looks as though the brake lights are operating in conjunction with the traction control so as the car accelerates away the brake lights keep coming on this looks really weird
5430821 fastest 30 to 70 mph acceleration of any production car ever tested by car amp driver magazine
5430822 our top gear acceleration measured 2 3 seconds for the 30 to 50 and 50 to 70 mph intervals the teslas 4 6 second total for the two tests bests that of a mercedes benz clk63 amg black series which was our 2007 champion in this measure of instant responsiveness

5430825 there would be an onboard generator for the occasional long trip
5430826 the electric vehicle revolution is critically important to the world and is way overdue
5430827 the overarching tesla motors goal is to do everything possible to increase the number of electric miles driven
5430828 the pumps dont work cause the vandals took the handles
5430829 look out kid its somethin you did god knows when but youre doin it again
5430830 tesla will likely provide both pure electric and range extended electric drive options in the future
5430831 can someone tell me what the deal is with the range change last week it was 245 miles per charge now its back to 220 mpc
5430832 model 2 s as only bevs until batterys technology and price catches up to their goal of 500 miles per charge the most someone can or should drive in a day
5430833 the electric vehicle revolution is critically important to the world and is way overdue tesla motors with the help of its customers and investors is going to lead the way in making it happen
5430834 tesla will likely provide both pure electric and range extended electric drive options in the future
5430835 makes me wonder was this martins sin he couldnt agree with your strategy
5430836 since wwll was caused by wwl and wwl was a war of oil and we are currently and continiously fighting a wars for oil
5430837 the strength of transparency sits right next to the weakness
5430838 we could increase the miles per charge in your vehicles at least three times with very little modification to your current design
5430839 now is not the time to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism
5430840 to do everything possible to increase the number of electric miles driven
5430841 another scenario what happens if there is a cyclone warning and you have evacuate to 300 miles away
5430842 i absolutely dont understand why anyone would want to hinder the development of any clean fuel source if you dont want to use hydrogen then dont use it jet aircraft require a fuel to burn and ocean going sea vessels cant stop and recharge on open sea voyages so hydrogen is the only viable solution to those two industries
5430843 if you dont want to use hydrogen dont use it
5430844 it is not the efficiency that matters it is the cost for the whole approach how much does it cost to acquire and charge 7 000 batteries for the car versus a fuel cell now that it takes 1 6th the platinum due to the nickel platinum alloy that was developed and the hydrogen i suspect they are similar
5430845 in the end anti hydrogen advocates are just trying to undermine existing energy companies that already possess the fuel stations and distribution system to handle hydrogen so you are once again undermining the military industrial complex
5430846 maybe there is a price point at which batteries overtake fuel cells but that is not your call it is for consumers to decide
5430847 i expect the tesla car like so much other crap from silicon valley to be a couple years late and to do approximately half of what they said it would do
5430848 but dont worry none of this is newsworthy pay no attention to that man behind the curtain
5430849 democracy is the worst form of government except of course for all the rest
5430850 tomorrow the sun will rise in the east and set in the west
5430851 other than some multi millionaire billionaire democrats in the senate who are the rich controlling our federal government
5430852 fortunately we live under a system of free market capitalism
5430853 maybe they should see if they can get computers right before they try to make a car
5430854 the overarching tesla motors goal remains unchanged from the day that i first funded tesla see the secret tesla master plan which is to do everything possible to increase the number of electric miles driven
5430855 instead of just talk about it like tesla and rest of silicon valley love to do
5430856 gm would never get away with delivering something not to spec
5430857 if thats all the situation were it would barely be worth noting
5430858 only general motors can get away with that kind of thing or at least they used to be able to
5430859 the kind of people who really drive world class sportscars as they were specd to be driven
5430860 the vehicle doesnt exist unless he sees it on the road
5430861 the first production model must role off the assembly line
5430862 around 2010 for its volt plug in also smart but gm better get moving because if toyota beat them then theyll suffer

5430864 throughout space there is energy it is a mere question of time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of nature
5430865 these charts show that electricity demand created by night time charging when rates are favorable will be mostly filled from coal fired capacity
5430866 plug in operations will degrade rather than improve greenhouse gas emissions in 2010

5430868 ill be sleeping in an extra 12 minutes every day
5430869 i give my clothes a quick once over with the iron every morning but i dream of a day when i can pull a balled up business shirt from the dryer chuck it on and walk straight out the front door
5430870 ive tried telling rob about microfibre and other modern materials you dont have to iron
5430871 but he wants more than that i havent seen him this whipped up about a cause since he convinced woolworths to start selling pre chopped mushrooms
5430872 robert makes some interesting points about effortless naturalism in fashion
5430873 but i cannot help but think his bold sartorial ideas derive not from an appreciation of stimulating the imagination through clothing but rather from a certain personal indolence
5430874 you realise this is a wedding not a funeral dont you
5430875 i find ties extremely uncomfortable to wear as i have been involved in singing since early high school i believe my neck may be thicker than the average persons as a result of this and other work i have done in the past though i have never had need to check
5430876 i cant afford my imagination no one can if you can afford what you can imagine then you are poor
5430877 we want you to be happy thats why we are giving you such a great deal

5430883 well we dont have many travelers or many people leaving the village for that matter i can find out about a horse how much do you have
5430884 a team that makes a commitment and tries to achieve it will outperform a team that does not

5430887 in the aftermath of sputnik 1 america rose to the challenge that it faced we invested in our own space program and we undertook a fundamental reexamination of the nations educational system focusing increased attention on science technology engineering and mathematics education what we now call stem education america prevailed moreover our accomplishments in space exploration opened a new era for humankind
5430888 we have many competing societal priorities that must be addressed but it is also vital that we invest in the future our space program is an important part of that future
5430889 the space age arrived with the roar of the soviet launch of sputnik after which our nation the leader of the free world propelled itself into a space race we recognized that we faced a challenge and we responded in the space race we demonstrated our will and our capabilities and the results of our past investments in space have transformed our society for the better we must maintain that commitment to a strong national space program
5430890 advancing the field of energy storage technologies brings with it several environmental economic and security related benefits and it is critical that the u s build up and maintain a competitive industrial capability in this sector
5430891 i am pleased that the committee could work in a bipartisan fashion to establish this aggressive research program that is vital to advancing the development of energy storage technologies for use in electric drive vehicles and stationary applications all with the goal of improving operation of our electricity delivery system allowing for new electric drive vehicles and more diversified electricity sources such as wind and solar power
5430892 the energy storage technology advancement act will help our country use energy more efficiently by establishing a program at doe to develop energy storage devices for stationary and vehicular applications i introduced similar energy storage legislation earlier this year and i thank chairman gordon for including much of my language in this important bill
5430893 the itp is already widely recognized for producing a number of high quality market ready technological advances that have saved industry billions in energy costs consequently preserving american jobs
5430894 unfortunately we have seen the budget for this program drop rapidly in the last few years we need to continue supporting this program while shifting the funding levels to reflect our priorities to ensure energy efficiency environmental performance and competitiveness through industrial efficiency research and development
5430895 with the current business challenges and the tightening of budgets we decided to focus our promotional dollars on activities that reach the most customers and get us the most return on investment
5430896 right now this is really just about increasing maintenance revenue
5430897 what they are offering is better than what the competitors are offering
5430898 by and large its not a good thing but compared to the competition for whats out there at 22 theyre trying to offer more

5430903 three or four years ago the buyers were not that sophisticated
5430904 they were trying to escape it and procurement so there was no provision for price escalation now theyre coming up for renewal and getting surprises with price increases and adding more people
5430905 not just renegotiating but negotiating can be difficult where the bar has not been set the same as in a traditional hosting arrangement
5430906 if youre dealing with one of the smaller vendors you might not be able to get the support turnaround youre looking for

5430911 often its not the people who renegotiate its the first time contract signers who need to be most vigilant in the contract when youre hooked with first time discounts thats the time to start thinking about future price increases once youre signed up the vendors have insight into how much youre using the software and how dependent you are
5430912 we have two flavors depending on the starting point and we try to stay pretty close to those
5430913 as we moved to a public company we really strive for a one year deal at this point otherwise you wind up with higher discount rates and for multi year revenue recognition theres financial implications that arent attractive when youre trying to model for the street we push for the one year deal and a multi year deal is the exception
5430914 in terms of dealing with these vendors its like any business you just need to be educated and know what youre getting into
5430915 it seems to be easier its a much simpler licensing model
5430916 for us on demand is key in everything we do i personally believe in the saas model in general
5430917 but the amount of storage that they give you is ridiculous you have to buy additional storage that so far has been one of their biggest weaknesses for us

5430948 but on the plus side my son can get those braces he needs
5430949 cough yourselves to death and rot in your mucous ridden graves
5430950 just like those days we can look forward to seeing a rise in family boardgame nights and a decrease in drunken arguments and barrel wearing
5430951 without racing carnivals theres really no reason for anyone to wear the ridiculous headgear that is their bread and butter
5430952 its a terrible shame about the horses but at least i still have the dishlickers
5430953 all i need is one trifecta and the kidsll be getting christmas presents this year
5430954 no matter how many nominees we looked at britneys name came up again and again
5430955 its just a shame she was too drunk to come to the awards ceremony
5430956 each new revelation from her ex bodyguards and assistants shows what a balanced person and wonderful mother britney is
5430957 every child dreams of a parent who takes care to hire an appropriate nanny to look after them while she goes out clubbing with no knickers on
5430958 when i saw britneys performance at the mtv video music awards i thought i had this thing in the bag
5430959 obviously id forgotten what an immoral mooching deadshit i am

5430972 finn what are you doing here this early is no one feeding you at the oflattery manor
5430973 how very nice maybe i will take claire out to the pond for a picnic lunch well aoife answer the boy he is waiting for your reply
5430974 aoife i am so sorry this is not how i wanted us to start our married life i just dont know what happened i didnt even think you will still marry me wont you
5430975 it was my fault just as much finn we will marry next week but how will we ever get through the ceremony with father flanagan aware of what happened he will need to hear our confession before the wedding i wont be able to look him in the eyes i hope god will be able to forgive us
5430976 what were trying to do is foster a consensus around what are the essential data components that need to be shared between agencies
5430977 i think you really have to have that kind of ability to understand the right partners to have at the table and also the right level of expertise whether theyre policymakers or technologists
5430978 it has to be a situation where its not just the federal government telling state and locals this is the standard were going to use this is how its going to be its really the opposite where were asking them what kind of things they need to have
5430979 he has developed at a pace that is absolutely astounding for someone his age and number of years out of school
5430980 when a position opened on the federal side i jumped on it
5430981 i knew it was an area i wanted to focus on for the foreseeable future
5430982 theres only one way to fight the insulting assertion that we dont have minds of our own
5430983 and thats with some snappy choreography to queen and david bowies under pressure
5430984 this piece bad night ii is not only critical of george bush and the war in iraq
5430985 its also completely derivative and creatively uninspired just a stale rehash of the schools acclaimed bad night in baghdad entry from 2004
5430986 its immediately obvious to me that the staff is behind this production no teenager would have enough sense to develop a clear and consistent opinion on global issues one look at the young liberals proves that much
5430987 theres a big finale where one of our year 9 students comes out in a gag and straitjacket with free speech written across his forehead
5430988 as the opening chords to eye of the tiger play the other students swirl around him metaphorically beating and burying him
5430989 just like the howard government wants to bury student involvement in politics
5430990 you are going to have to help out around here some
5430991 are you sure they wont be panhandling or going mental while they are here
5430992 id like to see these so called online networkers deal with a real zombie
5430993 you cant just click the ignore button when an inhumanly strong insatiably hungry reanimated corpse is bearing down on you burning with undead hatred and with no desire other than to feast on your dismembered carcass
5430994 anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of zombie lore would know were mindless creatures incapable of learning new skills or becoming stronger its factually incorrect and potentially harmful to give the impression that spreading the zombie infection makes you stronger
5430995 and i should clarify no zombie can become a ninja unless they were already one in life
5430996 certainly these zombies bear little similarity to their real world counterparts
5430997 but trevor should be happy people are raising awareness of zombism look at the pr boost vampires got from anne rices novels and angel

5431001 ive been listening to james songs ever since he released hand it down in 1990
5431002 i remember it well because my second class teacher used to play it while we did process writing
5431003 i think the time is right for james to put on an under 18s show
5431004 james came home early one day and caught me listening to a shannon noll album if he thinks going out with that little bitch is some kind of payback just wait until i get my hands on damien leiths phone number
5431005 i was originally trying to pay tribute to the pms resiliance by evoking the image of the don batting on and on forever immovably
5431006 but as a costello supporter the other implication doesnt exactly bother me
5431007 i have every confidence that when i retire peter will do a magnificent job
5431008 he will lead the liberal party with great ability and integrity until it dumps him for someone electable
5431009 i have often said that i would stay for as long as my party wanted me to
5431010 and ive proved again this week that there is no better way of getting the liberal party to demand i stay on than floating the prospect of a handover to costello
5431011 after all these years john and i find ourselves in a similar situation
5431012 im prevented from being re elected by the us constitution and hes prevented by public opinion
5431013 we were together on iraq we were together on global warming
5431014 and now were together under the massive backlash from those policies it was a bonding experience
5431015 besides i think anyone would appreciate johns friendship if the only other person who hadnt abandoned them was dick cheney
5431016 its great to have him here even if he had to decline my invitation to stay at kirribilli house citing security concerns i guess i was thinking that since laura isnt here perhaps we could hang out watch a few videos and maybe sink a few cold ones but of course i understand hes a very busy man free worlds dont lead themselves
5431017 im sticking by george bush because hes a mate and when someones your mate thats for life
5431018 and i hope the president remembers that when i lose the election
5431019 my team the dukes of ale always take home the 50 drink voucher at trivia madness down at the oxford so i thought id be a real contender on temptation jesus i was already spending the vault money

5431021 i cant believe i memorised all the melbourne cup winners and soviet leaders
5431022 i thought for sure thered be something on makybe diva what with the equine flu and everything
5431023 the look on his stupid fat i know all about the russian revolution face when he realised the only thing he was taking home was a pen was priceless maybe itll stop him trying to correct the quizmasters pronounciation for a week or two
5431024 i thought gerald would at least get a pick of the board
5431025 he knew the answer to the first fame game was ike turner we had a similar question at the pub two weeks ago why he said ted mulry instead ill never know
5431026 one things for sure hes definitely not holding the pen this thursday

5431030 harvard of the region where the university they attended is they may say something like
5431031 of the scanners tested a squared by emsisoft performed significantly better than the others
5431032 you never think of them as a star or any such thing
5431033 its about them as individuals as people and not about their agents or any media stuff its all about taking care of them as athletes
5431034 i took care of the team up until the time they left for athens
5431035 my goal is to help the athletes achieve their dreams and to do it safely
5431036 if an athlete is injured its important that we not bow to outside pressures we give them treatment options and they are included in the decision to compete or not we need to remember that it is not just a physical injury there is a mental side to it also
5431037 weve taken care of many of these kids since they first put on an elite leotard
5431038 and when it comes to the most important event of their lives its important they have a medical staff they trust and know
5431039 i still do all the athletic training things like taping ankles
5431040 there are times im the doctor and the trainer they get a two for one
5431041 in the past there have been gymnasts who were invited to trials based on my recommendation of their injury you dont want to be wrong
5431042 my initial musical vision for foreigner was to combine blues and r amp b with british rock and make it sound soulful and authentic
5431043 id grown up in england and had the english influence but i was also inspired by many elements of american music from mississippi blues to country and western foreigner was the vehicle to get that musical blend across
5431044 we dont mind your hybrid were even buying hybrid pieces from you but the all electric makes us look bad
5431045 we will remain very careful about which deals we consider and my job is to remind bernie from time to time that the tesla roadster is still job one
5431046 this morning i read that the entire ge plastics division is being sold to the saudis
5431047 this morning i read that the entire ge plastics division is being sold to the saudis
5431048 like the controller for an airbag the battery safety monitor responds to an emergency in this case by automatically disconnecting the battery pack from the vehicle and shutting down power to the car and to all electric cables in the car
5431049 i think marketvise it could be smart move to make a deal with altairnano
5431050 dear god man havent you heard about company research x why dont you agree with me that they are the dogs dangly bits going to rule the world etc etc
5431051 tesla roadster in times square nyc april 2007 so people know its a real world picture and not a studio shot
5431052 think will exclude batteries from the purchase price and charge drivers a monthly fee to
5431053 so that we can ship production esses and cars over the ocean
5431054 think will exclude batteries from the purchase price and charge drivers a monthly fee to
5431055 a wind turbine on the car will always increase the aerodynamic drag and the energy it produces will never be as much as the additional energy needed by the drive motor to overcome the wind turbines drag
5431056 there was one comment about a limited marine application as a possible teg market although battery only electric boats have very limited appeal with todays technology i think a series hybrid arrangement for 28 40 cruisers and expresses might be a great application those boats typically have 2 large ice engines plus an ice generator a 150kwh 200kwn battery plus an efficient generator may have an advantage
5431057 enable the car to be fully recharged in a matter of minutes
5431058 there was one comment about a limited marine application as a possible teg market
5431059 enough clean power to generate electricity for mankind for the next 1000 years
5431060 if altair nano batteries or any of the other for the moment vapor ware batteries like firefly and panasonic etc are all so great then why did think approached tesla for thier ess
5431061 also these infrastructure building ideas seem a bit premature given the small volume of roadsters coming next year
5431062 yes it can only serve a few fast charge cars until it has to recharge but its perfect for positioning somewhere in the middle of highway through a desert where there arent many cars coming frequently anyway
5431063 while tesla energy group is talking to other possible ess customers we will remain very careful about which deals we consider
5431064 on june 15 tesla motors will raise the price of the 2008 tesla roadster to 98 000 up from 92 000
5431065 2 seats fit do you still have luggage space when theyre in use
5431066 this is me and that is where i am going in my life want to get involved with me and my dream
5431067 il regardait le pass comme travers une fen tre poussi reuse il pouvait le voir mais pas le toucher
5431068 generating so much excitement for the tesla motors vision that a new supplier allocated the needed material to us
5431069 depending on how its processed for example a carbon fiber reinforced plastic part can replace an equivalent steel part using less than 30 percent of the original parts mass
5431070 this allowed us to maintain a bending stiffness similar to that of a regular steel body panel and lose about 50 pounds from the weight of the body panels compared to lightweight glass fiber composites
5431071 get the people off the halibutin planes like now perhaps
5431072 plenty of great sites still available at no cost to taxpayers
5431073 apollo has also patented a tri polar lead cobalt battery to be used with the apollo fuel cell the battery is made with lead foam electrodes making it lighter than ordinary lead acid batteries with a higher voltage as well as greater energy and power density three patents are pending on the new battery which apollo says would replace such advanced battery technologies as nickel metal hydride and lithium ion in many applications for approximately 20 percent of the cost
5431074 get the people off the halibutin planes like now perhaps
5431075 the metal bodied carrera gt doesnt suffer from the carbon fiber melting problem of another un named supercar
5431076 look at all the problems on earth we should solve them first before going to the moon
5431077 within five years solar power will be cheap enough to compete with carbon generated electricity even in britain scandinavia or upper siberia in a decade the cost may have fallen so dramatically that solar cells could undercut oil gas coal and nuclear power by up to half technology is leaping ahead of a stale political debate about fossil fuels
5431078 the generously sized sports sedan will feature a lightweight aluminum chassis and body
5431079 most of our employees who were engaged in the culling and mopping up operations earlier at various places in the district are indifferent to go further in the culling operation in ranaghat
5431080 these are means of our livelihood and if culled what will we eat
5431081 we are trying to ascertain the reasons for these deaths and close watch is being kept on the behaviour of other birds and animals
5431082 authorities have started culling operations tuesday and over 9 000 birds mostly chickens have been culled on the first day and about 12 000 on wednesday
5431083 equally distressing is the fact that essential therapeutic drugs are not supplied in most public health institutions with the exception of some states
5431084 west bengal is an area of concern because we have had outbreaks with some regularity it is not fully under control yet
5431085 they have not been able to completely depopulate the infected areas of birds
5431086 while after 9th april 2008 no new cases of bird flu have been detected in the state and the situation is under control the disease may erupt again if not checked in bangladesh which is not taking enough measures to curb it a formal letter has been sent by our high commission to the bangladesh government in the regard
5431087 while after 9th april 2008 no new cases of bird flu have been detected in the state and the situation is under control the disease may erupt again if not checked in bangladesh which is not taking enough measures to curb it
5431088 unless bird flu is contained completely in bangladesh the virus will keep spreading in tripura
5431089 our main problem in controlling the situation is because of close proximity with bangladesh
5431090 we had warned the tripura government about bird flu and we told them the reason for the spread of bird flu is because of bad farm practices
5431091 the government is going too slow and blaming bangladesh will not solve this problem as it is time we should take strong action
5431092 it was given by the culling party this morning after they slaughtered my poultry
5431093 they culled seven of my poultry chickens three ducks and a pair of desi chickens put the carcasses in a sack and gave me rs 590 as compensation
5431094 the officer said if i filed a formal complaint matters would be complicated and it would be difficult to prove it in court
5431095 now i have brought the matter to the notice of our village chief ali hossain and have to wait for him to do something
5431096 we got the confirmation yesterday from the cdc us centers for disease control and prevention yesterday
5431097 has survived he has been quarantined and his condition has improved
5431098 although there is no farm in the neighbourhood we suspect that he got the illness after his family bought chickens from a farm
5431099 the child was found infected by h5n1 but after treatment he has recovered and is now doing well
5431100 given the potential of the disease to affect several species of animals and man it has become necessary for the veterinary and medical scientists to keep a constant vigil over the disease to prevent a pandemic
5431101 the dreaded disease is to be tackled like a disaster and therefore we need to be prepared to meet any eventuality
5431102 we have tried to find out the exact cause behind the deaths of the children but the symptoms suggest that the disease is neither measles nor japanese encephalitis which were primarily suspected to be the cause of deaths it is probably a new strain of virus which can be confirmed only after detailed test of viscera samples at the national institute of virology niv pune
5431103 convulsion is the main symptom of the disease and the patient is dying within a short span of time we have collected one sample which will be sent to niv soon it appears that the disease is caused by a new strain of virus it could be confirmed by the niv after detailed examination of the sample
5431104 so far it can be said that as the victims had
5431105 the experts have suspected these diseases after antibodies were detected in the samples collected from the family members of some of the victims
5431106 the state health department usually informs us of the diseases but we are carrying out awareness campaigns among city dwellers to keep dengue and chikungunya away from the city we are requesting people to visit our malaria clinics to get their blood examined if one suffers from a fever
5431107 it means almost 60 of the malaria deaths last year could have been averted with timely treatment
5431108 targeting and appealing to a wide range of customer ages is age neutral marketing and is something marketers rarely do well
5431109 remember that the 50 plus are increasingly making decisions about products and services where they are the primary source of funding but not the customer
5431110 most companies segment their markets by age this made sense when age was a proxy for behaviour but that is no longer true
5431111 forget the caricatures and myths that abound about older people and apply the same rules of marketing as you would any other age group and dont forget it is all about lifestyle not age
5431112 todays business executives and mangers are highly mobile and their information needs are too
5431113 were excited to build out applications on the iphone platform to support these highly mobile customers
5431114 salesforce com is committed to dramatically expanding the potential for mobile applications in the enterprise
5431115 were always seeking to improve the service our customers enjoy by the smart use of innovative technology and the iphone is a fantastic way to achieve this
5431116 the iphone has set the pace for what that interface would be so we can have our applications emulate that form factor our customers use the applications we make and they re customise and build their own the iphone client respects whatever you build online and it opens up the possibility to build entire suites of customised applications
5431117 the iphone is revolutionising mobile communications and allows us to provide instant access to arrivals and departures information which will enhance the experience of travelling with ba
5431118 were always seeking to improve the service our customers enjoy by the smart use of innovative technology and the iphone is a fantastic way to achieve this
5431119 they used us as a springboard but i wouldnt be jumping out of our skin if i was them thinking that theyre back
5431120 we didnt talk about the fact weve won the last seven times against them i did hear that a couple of times this week in dispatches
5431121 we wouldnt mind playing them every week at the moment
5431122 i think our performance tonight was reasonably dominant and i think physically we were very good
5431123 hes okay he put a bit of a scare in the camp but i think its just a cork on his knee
5431124 the chinese regime has always relied on violence lies and advocating atheism to maintain its power they could not understand falun gongs peaceful efforts to protect their freedom of belief now they feel they cannot let people know what they have done to falun gong in china
5431125 what is it that the regime is trying to hide

5431128 id pay back uncle mick that 150 i owe him from 2005
5431129 mum and dad would get 50 000 each id start sponsoring a kid from africa get myself a new barina and id buy my girlfriend who id probably meet in an exclusive gold coast nightclub or on the greek isle of santorini an expensive cocktail dress
5431130 co workers singo and michael would be so jealous when they met her
5431131 good luck mate with the way id be spoiling her shed be 100 devoted to me
5431132 alan is really just setting himself up for disappointment with such unreasonable fantasies ive met him and believe me itd take more than a million dollars for that guy to land a girlfriend
5431133 imagine a communication channel that wasn t about us or them instead what if you could both talk about something else something you both inherently cared about i e a higher calling
5431134 video singer ginuwine and wife sole focused on raising their children
5431135 our economy is on the move and it is our job to keep it that way not with more government but with more enterprise
5431136 iowa produces more ethanol per year than any other state 840 5 million gallons annually now with six more plants under construction that will produce another 275 million gallons per year
5431137 i actually dont have a good suggestion about how to encourage consumers to make fuel efficient choices other than to make great electric cars
5431138 i have all this stuff for the two kids and if i have a playdate
5431139 for the long trips its so much more comfortable not to be squished in
5431140 for the price of my landrover i could have two priuses
5431141 certainly the game is rigged dont let that stop you if you dont bet you cant win
5431142 o k what do we do i need your help for ideas tech and money real money that you invest in companies like tesla
5431143 once this solar is installed and relatively soon paid off with cheap breakthru tech
5431144 a sports car than happens to be a sports sedan
5431145 so whats the answer some say its hydrogen which is a brilliant alternative
5431146 i dont think ethanol is the best solution for transportation
5431147 a lot of us who support tesla and look forward to buying one are also supporters of the presidents other policies it is disappointing to see on this blog so many rantings against the president
5431148 so eberhard contracted the company to assemble his new vehicle codenamed dark star after a classic low budget sci fi movie
5431149 the original white star was vaporized as sheridan crashed it into the largest city on zhadum whilst detonating two 500 megaton nuclear warheads
5431150 i only know of two things that are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the former
5431151 i worry about the future of tesla motors your product is fantastic and a step in the right direction however there have been other such products that have failed miserably everyone has heard of apples ipod but few know that a couple years before the ipod diamond rio introduced the first hand held mp3 player for 150 with 128m of memory about a cds worth of music why are they practically unheard of while the ipod has become iconic
5431152 ultracapacitors are not plug in replacements for batteries mainly because their energy density is so low todays ultracapacitors store around 1 of the energy of todays batteries and the resulting car would have around 1 of the range they do however deliver very high power density and are excellent for applications needing high power and low energy another difficulty with ultracapacitors is that their voltage drops steeply exponentially in fact with state of charge this means that we would need a fairly sophisticated high power switching power supply to normalize the voltage to the motor which isnt impossible but is definitely tricky and costly none the less i do think that new high energy ultracapacitors may one day be the right answer for electric cars just not now nobody makes ultracapacitors with anywhere near the energy density or pricing needed thats why they are not used in any consumer electronics yet but when ultracapacitors are ready for prime time we will be all over them
5431153 tesla motors chooses its technologies based on actual performance and actual feasibility
5431154 i assumed that like nearly every other energy forecast ive ready bush meant that we would reduce gasoline consumption by 20 percent from current levels apparently he is saying we should cut back by 20 percent from the projected increased demand of the future silly me
5431155 tesla on ice part 3 link whats odd though is it just me or do you also hear internal combustion engine sounds around 0 06 when the tesla starts moving again ive listened to it like 10 times and i cant figure that out
5431156 how many products do you suppose are shipping today with eestor super mega ultracaps the answer is zero not one single product and why do you suppose that is because eestor does not sell anything at all today not ultracaps not supercaps not even crummycaps this little detail has something to do with why we dont use eestor components in the roadster take one dose of reality and call me in the morning
5431157 war is a racket it always has been it is possibly the oldest easily the most profitable surely the most vicious it is the only one international in scope it is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives
5431158 keep in mind that long island was bought for 24 in 1624 yet if that cash had been stuck in a compounding account earning only 6 over the relatively short 381 years since then the total value would be well over 100 trillion dollars enough to buy long island and probably the rest of new york with it
5431159 a more significant problem is the power to energy ratio of the small parallel hev battery pack for the larger volt battery pack in li ion or nimh this is not a problem but for a vehicle like the prius it puts severe limits on how much braking or downhill energy the battery pack can absorb gm already developed a perfectly functioning plugin series hybrid based on the ev1 10 years ago quote from 1998 gms series hybrid using an electric motor to drive the front wheels uses a compact micro gas turbine generator system to charge the gm ovonic nimh hev battery pack while driving which provides an effective fuel economy of nearly 100 miles per gallon mpg of reformulated gasoline this is based on gms anticipation that the series hybrid owner will plug the vehicle in overnight while parked in the garage grid charging leaving in the morning with the hev batteries fully charged operating as an hev only no grid charging the hybrid obtains 60 mpg highway and provides a 350 mile driving range when the generator is running tailpipe emissions are one half of californias stringent ultra low emission levels ulev the very high power to energy ratio gm ovonic nimh battery provides ample power for acceleration zero to 60 mph in nine seconds and offers a zero emission ev only driving range of 40 miles significantly more than other hev battery types can provide
5431160 the net energy savings from replacing a gallon of gasoline with ethanol are only the equivalent of about a quarter of a gallon
5431161 force is all conquering but its victories are short lived
5431162 its silence can cause problem in crowded neighborhoods or in the vicinity of the sight impaired takaoka has solved this by adding optional sounds to the car

5431169 a motionless ev does not burn anything well does not the tesla have air conditioning
5431170 tesla whitestar the worlds first amp only car that fuels itself
5431171 lets build a bunch of expensive nuke plants and not mention solar since we know that building solar would drive cost of solar way down so that building nukes wouldnt make any sense by comparison
5431172 on the one hand as an environmentalist i care tremendously about global warming and anybody who doesnt is ignorant
5431173 calculations with the mars general circulation model show that the local climate around the martian south pole is currently in an unstable period
5431174 parallel global warmings observed simultaneously on mars and on earth can only be a straightline consequence of the effect of the one same factor a long time change in solar irradiance
5431175 the idea just isnt supported by the theory or by the observations
5431176 observed regional changes in south polar ice cover are almost certainly due to a regional climate transition not a global phenomenon and are demonstrably unrelated to external forcing
5431177 the warming of other solar bodies has been seized upon by climate skeptics but oh how wrong they are on mars the warming seems to be down to dust blowing around and uncovering big patches of black basaltic rock that heat up in the day
5431178 too costly to fix cant do it destroys the economy wouldnt be prudent

5431197 fuel cells are in their infancy but will soon demonstrate that it is technology of choice because the car does not store energy but generates it
5431198 if fuel cells make a breakthrough neither bevs nor hybrids will be required
5431199 fuel cell will get better and it will then be no problem to drive your car across the u s without having to recharge it
5431200 what we have now is a race between competing technolgies and what we may end up with may be someting that none of us has yet thought of

5431205 trinidad and tobago would seek economic integration by 2011 and political integration by 2013 with any or all of the nine members of the organisation of east caribbean states
5431206 nobody even knew this was under discussion its exactly the sort of process which will ensure that the scheme doesnt work policy announced from the top to a cynical population without even being properly thought out
5431207 looking for all intents and purposes like hes giving the people of trinidad and tobago a great big meggie
5431208 if the meg means that he was only kicksing about there not being a dengue outbreak or that trinbagonians deserve a big meggie for thinking they deserve a minister of health who actually has a clue

5431214 john mcclelland is part of the new type of grassroots leaders who are reshaping politics throughout texas and democracy for america is proud to endorse his campaign
5431215 nobody needs to tell john what grassroots people powered organizing is about because hes been doing it for years
5431216 i am incredibly honored to be endorsed by democracy for america because dfa was one of the first organizations i felt a connection with after the 2004 elections howard dean was the first democrat i voted for in a democratic primary
5431217 having the support of grassroots democrats as well as the endorsement of a respected and admired national organization like dfa is crucial to victory in local races i am very proud and humbled to receive this endorsement
5431218 john mcclelland knows we need to fully fund our public schools to ensure our children are ready to contribute to and compete in the 21st century economy john mcclelland is a forward thinker bringing to the table solutions like implementing a truly modern mass transit system for north texas and across the state
5431219 john mcclelland wont wait to solve the health care crisis that is wreaking havoc on the lives of working men and women he will work to bring affordable health care to all texans
5431220 no the problem isnt lack of specifics its lack of passion when it comes to the economy mr obamas campaign seems oddly lethargic

5431225 we wanted to do something for the iphone but we just didnt have the scheduling or the resources available
5431226 we have a title we want to develop exclusively for iphone
5431227 im not announcing anything specifically but it would be a graphical tour de force
5431228 the iphone as a device is in the same generation power wise as the ps2 or xbox
5431229 the graphics are a little lower but the ram is a lot higher you could easily spend 10 million on an iphone game but the market just cant support that yet
5431230 i want to go step by step where we do a multiplayer game then multiplayer with some persistence then maybe further we dont want to be in a bet the company situation at this moment
5431231 if we had an infinite amount of time and budget we could make an awesome massively multiplayer game
5431232 but the whole idea of id mobile is we can make something good and we can make it quick
5431233 hey on top of it maybe if our cities were designed properly we wouldnt need to drive so much anyway
5431234 you may think i say i believe battery electric cars are the best solution because i own run an battery electric car company when the opposite is true i started a battery electric car company because i believe battery electric cars are the best solution
5431235 2008 production will easily exceed 1 000 cars exceeding the worldwide fleet of fuel cell cars
5431236 on schedule to place 15 000 battery electric tesla vehicles on the road by the end of 2010 when you are already at least a month behind schedule for starting construction on the albuquerque plant
5431237 our strategy here at tesla motors is to use the very best technology that is actually available we innovate where we can and where it matters but we avoid frivolous innovation and getting mired in unsolvable problems i think weve done a pretty good job with the tesla roadster we will continue to evaluate new technologies innovate where sensible and make the best choices for every future tesla motors model
5431238 historically battery performance has improved by about eight per cent per year i think its reasonable to extrapolate that sort of improvement for some more years to come driven primarily by the laptop and cell phone industry
5431239 how quickly we climb the ladder of success only to find our ladder has been placed on the wrong wall
5431240 aerovironment used a 250kw grid connected av advanced battery charger for the demo
5431241 while elons great for slamming fuel cells and advocating batteries im disappointed that hes letting another industry take the drivers seat and control the ev future
5431242 proven by significant profits made on scientific weather bets with william hill at odds and verification organized independently by the uk met office
5431243 combining the area under the curve power with a mid engine platform nets a car with few if any peers
5431244 the tesla roadster is still the quickest and most fun car i have ever driven the way it hugs the corners the way it pulls out of a corner is simply without compare
5431245 timo wrote on may 31st 2007 at 12 29 am 250kw power is only about 600vx3 140a that is within limits of basic three phase connector so it can quite well be one plug and socket
5431246 so top speed higher than 130 mph will require total redesign of ess and cooling system for electric motor in addition to gearbox
5431247 not as badly as producing ethanol because the enzyme process is more efficient
5431248 on schedule to place 15 000 battery electric tesla vehicles on the road by the end
5431249 fool there is no room for you to get back in the queue and there is car coming at the opposite direction so you are causing trouble
5431250 well thats nothing my ev can be recharged in fifteen minutes
5431251 wow where can you go to charge it that quickly
5431252 well nowhere the fast charging stations wanted to charge me five times the price for the same electricity i can get at home overnight so i stopped going theyve all closed down now i guess they couldnt get the business
5431253 unlike the tesla electric sport car which is powered by thousands of tiny batteries the r1 conversion uses just 28 each of them is 90 amp hours at 3 2 volts and 6 6 pounds
5431254 well thats nothing my ev can be recharged in fifteen minutes
5431255 wow where can you go to charge it that quickly
5431256 well nowhere the fast charging stations wanted to charge me five times the price for the same electricity i can get at home overnight so i stopped going theyve all closed down now i guess they couldnt get the business

5431265 field weakening situation that occurs when over rated speeds are achieved usually over rated frequency values imposes a flux reduction and peak torque decreases
5431266 in order to extend their speed range whilst keeping within an economic inverter rating variable frequency synchronous motors are often operated with field weakening at speeds above a base speed applications such as electric vehicle drives require high torque capability from zero speed up to base speed and approximately constant power capability over a speed range of typically 3 1 above base speed
5431267 the motor is around 5 times lighter than the closest rival
5431268 asked whether they thought about using in wheel motors since putting a small motor in every wheel instead of having one big motor with a drivetrain connecting it to the four wheels can greatly reduce mechanical complexity and weight as well as improving reliability this is one thing evs make possible which simply cant be done feasibly with combustion engines interestingly they did consider it but jb said it would have made safety certification extremely difficult its perfectly safe but the certification regulations are written assuming you have one motor and a drivetrain so there are some certifications such as the one for anti lock braking you cant pass in a car with no drivetrain these rules would need to be re written to allow vehicles with in wheel motors to be certified which is obviously not going to happen without significant money and time spent lobbying not a fight a small startup company should take on if it can avoid it
5431269 cocconi meanwhile worked obsessively at home month after month designing and building the cars inverter its electronic heart
5431270 also it looks like gm is looking at altair batteries through cobasys
5431271 and around 2010 the united states made the transition to evs from ices for america understood the need to stop using fossil fuels which were already in decline
5431272 i might stop buying from you because the other guy is offering a better price
5431273 just how is this transition from internal combustion to electric power actually going to work as the people in england pointed out we do not have anywhere to park but on the street and running a cord to the ev is not really practicle
5431274 with federal tax credits and various other things the price will be below 90k
5431275 electric vehicle maker zap says it will come out with an electric car that will go about 100 miles on a charge but cost only 30 000 a combination of features that so far hasnt been achieved
5431276 zap ceo steve schneider though asserts that zap has enlisted a number of partners on the project group lotus in england is helping with the cars design the company is also working with some of the new entrants in the lithium ion battery market

5431281 sorry im late sir but at least im earlier than i would be if i owned a tesla
5431282 the driver has little or no control if someting goes wrong
5431283 you need some sort of emergency backup system for this car and it had better be on this car before it hits the streets
5431284 tesla drivers they will never forget you for putting them in this dangerous situation where they are completely helpless
5431285 in five years eberhard wants to be producing a 30 000 electric car known as blue star if necessary the company would be willing to use a small gas engine to boost blue stars range and broaden its appeal
5431286 if you believe in your technology and your vision you have to trust that the consumer will follow
5431287 wow why are so many people getting upset about this why is such a small company getting such disproportionate attention
5431288 i would guess that 12 carbon fiber batteries will get you 200 to 300 miles range per charge
5431289 tesla will buy the batteries from one or more japanese suppliers the japanese market share leaders are sanyo sony matsus hita nec and hitachi
5431290 the roadster can handle charge from a 110 or 220 volt circuit and be adjusted to charge at rates between 15 amps and 70 amps this can take anywhere from 3 5 hours 70 amps at 220 v to over 24 hours 15 amps at 110 v in both cases the charger itself is on board there is no required charging infrastructure for the car other than access to the grid
5431291 what people dont appreciate is that the cost of the cobalt used in lithium ion batteries has jumped from 40 000 to 60 000 per ton and the nickelmetal chemistry has jumped from 10 000 to 14 000 per ton in the last 18 months due to chinas increased demand for stainless steel
5431292 along the way we made several design decisions that improve the safety and durability of the car understanding that there would be tradeoffs the two most significant decisions were
5431293 were not interested in developing better batteries because we dont really want batteries that can replace fuel so the batteries which we use dont need to be that good thereby proving that batteries arent viable without a decent ice

5431295 it a shame the ev1s are still not around because we would be rolling down the freeways in style
5431296 another difficulty with ultracapacitors is that their voltage drops steeply exponentially in fact with state of charge this means that we would need a fairly sophisticated high power switching power supply to normalize the voltage to the motor which isnt impossible but is definitely tricky and costly

5431346 for ranges individually rated more than 8 kw and of different ratings but none exceeding 27 kw an average value of rating shall be calculated by adding together the ratings of all ranges to obtain the total connected load using 12 kw for any range less than 12 kw and dividing by the total number of ranges then the maximum demand in column c shall be increased by 5 percent for each kilowatt or major fraction thereof by which the average value exceeds 12 kw
5431347 when it is unlikely that two or more noncoincident loads will be in use simultaneously it shall be permissible to use only the largest load s that will be used at one time for calculating the total load of a feeder or service
5431348 usually when a spa is connected to a dedicated 230 volt line its biggest requirement for the higher voltage is the electric heater most of these will have a heater element that is rated between 5000 and 6000 watts and at this level of power the element alone will draw between 20 to 25 amps then add in the requirement for the pump s at 8 to 14 amps each thats a lot of power

5431522 all i did was bring up this one time in pe when he and i got in trouble for stealing a tee ball stand next thing i know hes talking about how much he loved the nikes i used to wear then i spent about 40 minutes listening to a recap of some handball game before harshula turned up and got me off the hook
5431523 the worst part is i have no idea who lee is

5431572 to set a company on a strong profitable growth trajectory in the face of these industry conditions it wont work to benchmark competitors and try to outcompete them by offering a little more for a little less
5431573 to fundamentally shift the strategy canvas of an industry you must begin by reorienting your strategic focus from competitors to alternatives and from customers to noncustomers of the industry to pursue both value and cost you should resist the old logic of benchmarking competitors in the existing field and choosing between differentiation and cost leadership as you shift your strategic focus from current competition to alternatives and noncustomers you gain insight into how to redefine the problem the industry focuses on and thereby reconstruct buyer value elements that reside across industry boundaries conventional strategic logic by contrast drives you to offer better solutions that your rivals to existing problems defined by your industry

5431603 law enforcement has a legitimate right to try to solve crimes and track suspects provided that there are protections so that the innocent are not improperly snooped upon
5431604 our main point with this is that before installing a gps tracking device secretly on someones vehicle a judicial officer should make the decision about how much evidence is good enough how long the tracking can be for and the parameters of the tracking
5431605 i want to point out its very easy to get a warrant if the police have a good reason it doesnt take a long time and if there is a real reason the warrant will be granted

5431631 the recent futuregen announcement takes the program in a dramatically different direction the reasons for this abrupt change in the futuregen program are unclear however the administration claims that increases in cost estimates for the program were a contributing factor in this decision we wish to have a better understanding of the developments in the program that led to this recent decision and an examination of the administrations rationale and plans for restructuring this program there is a need to accelerate the development of carbon capture and sequestration technologies and we want to ensure the departments approach to this challenge will deliver the capability we need in the most cost effective and rapid time frame possible
5431632 the iea report correctly identifies the two key questions facing our country with regard to energy policy how can u s increase energy security by reducing dependence on foreign energy sources and how do we address growing greenhouse gas emissions
5431633 the report praises the passage of hr 6 the energy independence and security act enacted in december 2007 and notes that the u
5431634 the path forward to our energy future is lined with new technologies that will diversify our energy supply with renewable sources and clean uses of fossil fuels such as coal
5431635 last year this committee answered that call by authorizing as part of hr 6 a significant expansion of the department of energys carbon capture and storage research and demonstration program including authorization of up to one billion dollars for demonstrations for carbon capture and another 1 2 billion for up to 7 demonstrations for large scale carbon dioxide injection and storage ensuring that these demonstrations are aggressively pursued and funded is the best way to ensure we can continue to use our vast coal supplies in a cleaner and more efficient way and well into the future
5431636 i am happy that the administration remains determined to keep nsf on a doubling path and that key nsf education programs are getting an increase
5431637 however i join committee colleagues on both sides of the aisle in my voicing my dismay at the treatment of k 12 education in the budget request the america competes act addressed the critical shortage of k 12 stem teachers by increasing funding for the noyce teacher scholarship program it is unfortunate that the administration chose to flat fund this program instead of sharing the sentiment that nsf should invest in increasing the number of well trained k 12 stem teachers
5431638 i am also interested in learning more about nsfs decision to apply all of the increases in the graduate research and education to the graduate research fellowship program rather than distributing the increase between grf and igert since igert is also an extremely well regarded and effective program
5431639 as a social scientist i also want to say a word about the social and behavioral sciences while i understand that not all fields will get equal increases every year i want to reiterate the importance of the social sciences to all of the major challenges our nation is facing including energy water health national security and competitiveness
5431640 there are some encouraging features of the fy 2009 budget request for noaa for the first time in years the president has requested an increase for the agency over the current years funding level we are pleased to see additional funds requested to restore some climate sensors and to upgrade a variety of models technology and software systems however i believe the administrations budget proposal still lacks the level of funding needed for this agency to truly fulfill all of its diverse missions
5431641 the need for satellite based measurement is growing but the budgets are not expanding to provide the additional funds necessary to accommodate these needs
5431642 we all know and have personally experienced flight delays and cancellations due to inclement weather they are an all too common occurrence but there is more than convenience at stake here there is also a question of safety severe storms or rapidly changing conditions can create serious risks for aircraft these two agencies should be working together cooperatively to ensure the smooth safe flow of air traffic in our nation we want to ensure that as faa and nws evaluate the aviation weather forecasting program they keep these essential goals in mind
5431643 until both agencies are able to measure and ensure the quality of the aviation weather products at the en route centers faa may not be getting the information it needs to effectively manage air traffic
5431644 any restructuring of aviation weather forecasting services must be done in a manner that will ensure at a minimum there is no degradation in these services going forward there are no cost savings or efficiencies to be found by reducing the safety of air travel for the public i believe the agencies are now moving in the right direction faa and nws should continue to work together to implement a high quality aviation weather forecast system that ensures safe convenient air travel for the public

5431647 the four innovators in this resolution have been recognized by the national society for black engineers for their significant contributions to society
5431648 it was hard to find a photo of some of them they had received so little recognition the diversity and innovation caucus strives to lift up african americans and other under represented minorities who excel in science these inventors inspire and encourage just by their example
5431649 engineers have helped us build boats to cross the seas railroads to take us west and the internet to communicate with the world
5431650 today we need the innovative capabilities of engineers to confront the new challenges before us such as developing american energy independence finding solutions to confront global climate change and making our nation more secure i would like to thank the engineers that have contributed so much to america and to honor them for their commitment to continue working to better our society
5431651 finally the cdc has reached the conclusion that it should have made more than a year ago that because of high levels of formaldehyde fumes travel trailers are not safe for anyone to live in this confirmation is long overdue these agencies knew since the spring of 2006 that hurricane katrina and rita victims living in those trailers were getting sick my committees investigation over the past few months shows that fema delayed credible testing of the trailers and the cdc failed to look at the health consequences of exposure to formaldehyde
5431652 cdc said today that everyone needs to be out of these trailers by the summer when formaldehyde levels are expected to increase significantly but 100 000 victims of hurricanes katrina and rita are still living in 38 000 of these unhealthy trailers and mobile homes at its current rate of 800 families a week it will take 47 weeks to relocate all these families this is completely unacceptable i can only hope that fema acts immediately to move all of these people out and i intend to be monitor this situation closely
5431653 i also intend to make sure that the victims of the recent tornados in my home state of tennessee are given safe housing by fema

5431665 its terrible using this system i must use four editors each day to get my studies done because not one of them does everything
5431666 and what would you propose that will solve this obvious dilemma
5431667 well its obvious i will write the best editor ever it will do everything that the existing four editors do but do their jobs better and faster and because of my new editor the world will be a better place
5431668 do you think i want to learn yet another editor
5431669 it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
5431670 whether you can make words mean so many different things
5431671 is getting the application systems running in different business units to work together better to coin a phrase

5431673 people will continue to use monolithic architectures but they wont continue to be the center of attention for most new application systems today were looking at service oriented architectures soa and soon well be seeing more discussion of event driven architecture eda as the fundamental design concepts behind application systems
5431674 the esb craze has entered the final phase with jboss entering the fray the real problem is that despite all these vendors entering the market there is even more confusion about what specific features an esb must have
5431675 there are more vendors than the market will be able to support in the long term and this will result in price pressure

5431682 what a difference a few more bucks for first rate architecture makes to everyone and everything it impacts
5431683 traditional middleware is insufficient to support new applications that use service oriented architecture soa event driven architecture eda web services and business process management bpm architects and is managers must upgrade the enterprise infrastructure by adding an enterprise service bus esb

5431685 there is no such thing as a free lunch and when someone sends you a sweepstakes and asks you to send money so forth to collect it or to pay the taxes and so forth 99 9 percent of the time its a scam
5431686 the idea of building services and minimizing their redundancy and being able to flexibly plug them into this infrastructure grid and use them flexibly as needed is the way everything should be built
5431687 few want to do it but it actually saves later on especially in terms of business agility
5431688 this is the story i preach in all my engagements
5431689 this has been my mantra for about 12 15 years now you can implement just about anything today we have lots of technology to get the job done but it may not be manageable or agile over time so we really need to focus on that manageability long term thats what will give the real benefit to the organization dont implement what you cant manage

5431706 there were many walking wounded being seen to by ambulance staff and half a dozen with head wounds

5431713 the owners of this country know the truth its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to believe it the real owners are the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions forget the politicians theyre an irrelevancy the politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice you dont you have no choice you have owners they own you they own everything they own all the important land they own and control the corporations theyve long since bought and paid for the senate the congress the statehouses the city halls theyve got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so that they control just about all of the news and information you hear theyve got you by the balls they spend billions of dollars every year lobbying lobbying to get what they want well we know what they want they want more for themselves and less for everybody else but ill tell you what they dont want they dont want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking they dont want well informed well educated people capable of critical thinking theyre not interested in that that doesnt help them thats against their interests they dont want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly theyre getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago you know what they want obedient workers people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork but just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay the longer hours reduced benefits the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it and now theyre coming for your social security they want your fucking retirement money they want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on wall street and you know something theyll get it theyll get it all sooner or later because they own this fucking place its a big club and you aint in it you and i are not in the big club
5431714 there is a certain amount of righteous indignation i hold for this culture because to get back to the real root of it to get broader about it my opinion that is my species and my culture in america specifically have let me down and betrayed me i think this species had great great promise with this great upper brain that we have and i think we squandered it on god and mammon and i think this culture of ours has such promise with the promise of real true freedom and then everyone has been shackled by ownership and possessions and acquisition and status and power

5431736 last august congress passed and the president signed into law the america competes act a response to the 2005 national academies report rising above the gathering storm and supported by a wide range of u s industries universities and science organizations competes seeks to ensure u s students teachers businesses and workers will continue leading the world in science innovation research and technology as we all know the global marketplace continues to become more competitive the fact of the matter is our country can not and should not compete with the rest of the world on wages when half of the worlds workers earn less than 2 a day our country needs to compete at a higher level with better skills and higher productivity this was the goal of the america competes act the law presents a balanced set of policies to improve our countrys short term and long term competitiveness competes invests in long term science and research but also short term technology development and innovation just as importantly competes ensures not only that our nation will produce the worlds leading scientists and engineers but also that all students will have a strong grounding in math and science and are prepared for technical jobs in every sector of the economy unfortunately although the administrations budget is supportive on basic research it is weak on several other components critical to our countrys competitiveness dr marburger i see in your testimony that you quoted from the presidents state of the union address well i would like to quote the presidents speech as well the president said that last year fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record i suppose thats the good news unfortunately the bad news is that our students are far from measuring up compared to other industrialized countries according to the latest oecd program for international students assessment or pisa students in the u s ranked 25 th out of 30 developed countries in math in science the news is just as bad u s students ranked 21st in science down from 19th in 2003 and 14th in 2000 in fact 25 percent of u s students failed to reach even a basic level where they could identify scientific concepts or apply data to a personal decision knowing this i am deeply disappointed that yet again the presidents budget does not make k 12 education programs at nsf a priority the top recommendation of the national academies was to ensure k 12 stem teachers across the country have strong content knowledge and effective teaching skills the national academies report cited the uteach program which was developed 10 years ago at the university of texas as an example of what is working for stem teacher education based on its success uteach has been used as a model by the state of california in an effort to reform stem teacher education likewise the private sector has pledged significant funding to expand this teacher education model nationwide this committee led the way in competes taking this top recommendation and revamping nsfs robert noyce scholarship but under the administrations budget the noyce program would receive only 10 of the funding needed to mobilize the new program competes also seeks to ensure that u s companies and small businesses lead the world in innovation creating jobs in the process our country has lost 3 4 million manufacturing jobs under this administrations watch with 217 000 jobs lost in 2007 alone and manufacturing employment in the u s now stands at its lowest point since 1950 competes seeks to reverse this trend with robust funding for the manufacturing extension partnership and technology innovation program both of which have proven track records for return on investment and job creation however the administrations budget phases out mep and eliminates tip immediately these programs help create good american jobs that this budget would put in jeopardy finally competes seeks to reduce our dependence on foreign energy and address global climate change through an advanced research projects agency for energy arpa e modeled after the defense departments successful darpa program arpa e is charged with rapidly developing and commercializing transformational clean energy technologies through collaborative research with the university and private sector nothing like this research model currently exists within the department of energy a successful arpa e will stand on its own within the department and have the authority and resources to quickly assemble teams to crash on research projects that neither industry nor the department will do on their own a successful arpa e just might cause us to rethink how we do energy research in the u s and the administration should reconsider its lack of support for the program the president is right that basic r amp d funding included in his american competitiveness initiative is important to our economy and our future but i believe the administration is wrong that we dont also need to be committed to a globally competitive workforce investments in small manufacturers that create jobs and a new approach to cutting edge energy research last year the president threatened to veto appropriations bills that would have come much closer to fully funding competes as well as his aci the administration should listen to the businesses and educators and scientists and engineers in this country and support full funding of competes this year

5431738 for almost 30 years congress has been attempting legislative solutions to the national need for sufficient disposal capacity of llrw generated here in the u s there is no indication in legislative history nor in the nrcs regulatory actions that there was any intention the u s would ever become a welcome dumping ground for foreign generated radioactive waste
5431739 those important policy goals dont appear in this license application
5431740 and this is not a one time application this is the beginning of a commercial business that energysolutions intends to expand in fact earlier this week a company spokesman was quoted as saying that he hoped the italian project and other foreign ventures would bring in more business to energysolutions processing facilities in the u s

5431928 as a fellow american tennessean and public servant i commend the nobel committees selection of vice president gore and the ipcc for this years peace prize as my committee has discovered first hand each of their groundbreaking efforts on climate change has provided us with greater knowledge tools and proof than ever before to combat this alarming phenomenon vice president gore has devoted nearly 30 years to the subject of global warming though climate change is not the type of issue that politicians usually raise as a centerpiece of their message al took on the challenge long ago of convincing people that a global environmental issue like climate change was something they should be concerned about we also must recognize the work of the ipccs more than 2 500 scientific expert reviewers from over than 130 countries who spent 6 years doing the work on the reports that have been issued this year they have confirmed for us that the earth has a fever and that inaction to ease that fever is no longer an option we all want to leave our children a world filled with all the promise and wonder that we inherited from our parents and grandparents we have no choice but to begin to act in a way that will secure that inheritance for our children the work of vice president gore and the ipcc has provided us with a clear path forward on climate change now it is up to us to take action

5431945 we do have freedom of religion in this country but freedom of religion like all of our other rights is not a right that dominates everything else

5431954 going from there i guess one company that would obviously pop to mind with respect to altairnano would be zap they recently announced their zap x vehicle based on the lotus apx and the specifications that they quoted for it based on what they quoted with the fast charging time and the performance capabilities it would seem that the only battery maker that would currently fit into those specs would be altairnano so are you actively working with zap do you expect them to be using your battery in that vehicle
5431955 we have been talking with zap and lotus and yes zap has aspirations to use the altair technology in their vehicle and were in discussion around the commercial terms of that agreement just a comment if i may im not aware of anyone who has battery technology similar to altairnanos nanosafe battery performance steven schneider the ceo of zap hes been quite interested in the altairnano technology for some time weve had extensive discussions with steven and his team and i think hes quite excited about the altair nanotechnology and what it can do for the zap vehicle

5431968 the risk of bringing about fundamental brain damage is very great indeed excessive consumption of alcohol can cause memory loss
5431969 for example it can make you totally forget the details of politically sensitive events like what goes on in new york strip clubs
5431970 the simple truth is these scare tactics programs are ineffective in combating substance abuse what we need is a complete ban on alcohol advertising so teen bingeing can be eradicated just like smoking was in the 1990s
5431971 that shot of the girl passing out and being taken advantage of after drinking too much vodka really spoke to me
5431972 there was this one time my mates and i went skinny dipping down the beach and ended up vomiting sambuca into the ocean im amazed we didnt drown god i miss those days
5431973 generally men and women should be having no more than two standard drinks a day
5431974 unless of course theyre mature and cool enough to be able to handle their liquor
5431975 oh well if binge drinking is bad we should drink more more often so we get used to it

5431983 its enough to shake your faith in the existence of an benevolent god
5431984 shirts with jokes like i found jesus he was hidden behind the couch the whole time printed on them seemed to be nothing more than harmless ribbing but such is the way satan works hiding sin behind a fa ade of innocence

5431987 soa is not new its been around at least two decades but its suddenly a hot topic
5431988 architects have known soa is the most adaptable design but vendors used to tell me if you mentioned soa you increased your sales cycle by a year right there no one wanted to know about soa they just wanted to know about solutions
5431989 soas were difficult to build because no one could agree on the interfaces no one was winning
5431990 they are the standard that everyone finally is agreeing on and this is really fueling the adoption of soa from a technical point of view its enabling it
5431991 soa is an application architecture style similar to the way a client server architecture is a style
5431992 in soa the objective is to have loosely coupled interactive software services
5431993 soa enables reuse because you can have these business services that arent directly tied into closely coupled with one particular application in soa you have reusable components that communicate with each other through standardized interfaces and this is really the key the standardized interfaces
5431994 so if martin is able to deliver a 100k electric car in 6 months and you would be surprised to see a 100k fuel cell car in 6 years why should we fund your research what is so much better about hydrogen than batteries that we can afford to wait 10 15 years for it to be cost competitive when 100 000 battery electric cars could be sold for 30k in half that time
5431995 but the epa ratings are crap the prius really gets closer to 45mpg
5431996 not for 2007 because they are gearing up with the new crds that meet the tier amp bin requirements with the 2008 my cars the dc guys didnt like that
5431997 in fact shell makes so much hydrogen that it could power the entire fleet of american cars were they powered by hydrogen
5431998 note that tesla motors has been approached by quite a few of the car companies around the world about its battery technology and has just signed a deal to provide batteries to one
5431999 we believe hydrogen is the only source of energy that provides flexibility and thats what makes it unique
5432000 a few manufacturers are now developing smaller vehicles using lithium based batteries however the panel concluded that in california full sized battery electric vehicles are still not likely to be a mass market technology in the foreseeable future due to high cost of the batteries and limited customer acceptance
5432001 you could aslo improve aerodynamic drag coefficient from 0 4 of tesla roadster to say 0 2 demonstrated by most aerodynamic concept vehicles

5432009 low oil prices here in the us obscure the issue right now
5432010 but in ten years well see a substantial increase in gasoline prices
5432011 just an idea why charge the batteries at stations cant we just replace battery packs with already charged one i mean people go to energy stations they give their empty battery packs and get a new charged one
5432012 do you remember when the first roadster got only 220 miles on a charge

5432026 how can i open up a tesla dealership here in the atlantic city new jersey area
5432027 china reported that approximately 20 days ago a man suddenly died
5432028 3 people died 10 days ago 6 or 7 more are being treated in the wendeng central hospital people have been to the area to investigate but they are unable to classify the disease
5432029 presently the cases that are coming in gorakhpur are mostly virus infected cases the most common viruses are enterovirus and coxsackievirus the symptoms are almost same but the disease is fatal which leaves person paralysed even if cured near about ten per cent kids infected by this disease are mentally or physically crippled
5432030 my child had fever initially then he started vomiting then there was swelling now the condition is better but the fever is coming frequently
5432031 daily eight to ten kids are infected with brain fever are coming here and daily four to five kids are losing their lives
5432032 two children died of some disease and nearly 100 people are ill besides suspending the lekhpal two other health workers have been suspended
5432033 it may be a viral fever but chances of japanese encephalitis cannot be ruled out
5432034 she fell ill and her condition continued to deteriorate with each passing day before we could understand anything she expired
5432035 among the nine deaths in the district tests have proved that only one had died due to malaria but no doubt malaria is on the rise in the district
5432036 malaria and anaemia are the two major diseases being faced here
5432037 during monsoon this is not unusual in this part of the district dirt littered garbage and water pollution is responsible for more people being affected

5432041 the least costly transaction when dealing with a troubled bank the fdic wont reimburse uninsured depositors if it means increasing the loss to the deposit insurance fund as a result uninsured depositors are protected only if a bank acquiring the failed bank will pay more for all of the deposits than it would for insured deposits only
5432042 we are puzzled by this suit we have been cooperating with the secretary of state galvins office throughout this inquiry
5432043 wrote off 524 million in construction and development loans in the third quarter of 2007 almost nine times the amount of 2006
5432044 more than 60 of florida banks have commercial real estate loans worth more than 300 of their capital a level that automatically attracts more attention from examiners
5432045 dozens of u s banks will fail in the next two years as losses from soured loans mount and regulators crack down on lenders that take too much risk especially in real estate and construction
5432046 losses from securities linked to subprime mortgages may exceed 265 billion as regional u s banks credit unions and overseas financial institutions write down the value of their holdings
5432047 it may cut or reduce ratings of 534 billion of subprime mortgage securities and cdos as default rates rise
5432048 actually im worried not so much about the junk bond market itself as the huge market for a derivative called a credit default swap or cds built on top of that junk bond market
5432049 this has grown to be a huge market the total value of all cds contracts is something like 450 trillion some studies have put the real credit risk at just 6 of the total or about 27 trillion that puts the cds market at somewhere between two and six times the size of the u s economy
5432050 all it will take in the cds market is enough buyers and sellers deciding they cant rely on this insurance anymore for junk bond prices to tumble and for companies to find it very expensive or impossible to raise money in this market
5432051 one has to realize that there is now a rising probability of a catastrophic financial and economic outcome i e a vicious circle where a deep recession makes the financial losses more severe and where in turn large and growing financial losses and a financial meltdown make the recession even more severe that is why the fed has thrown caution to the wind and taken a very aggressive approach to risk management

5432167 for ceos north america is already a single market and business decisions are no longer made with a mexico strategy or a canada strategy but rather with a north american strategy i think its pretty clear now that it no longer makes sense to talk about u s competitiveness and mexican competitiveness or for that matter about the competitiveness of canada we are all in this together we as north americans

5432176 although many conservatives refuse to accept the reality george w bush is a one world neo liberal who drove budget and trade deficits to record heights president bush has pressed hard for the security and prosperity partnership the first step toward a north american union that will threaten our sovereignty the administration has permitted american businesses to hire illegal aliens encouraged the invasion of 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens and has given mexico and corporate america dominion over our borders and our immigration policy the assault on our national sovereignty continues the president is urging the senate to act favorably on our accession to the u n convention on the law of the sea the treaty will submit the united states to international tribunals largely adverse to our interests and dispute resolution mechanisms are stacked against the united states the treaty would undermine our national sovereignty and act as a back door for global environmental activists to direct u s policy
5432177 expressing the sense of congress that the united states should not engage in the construction of a north american free trade agreement nafta superhighway system or enter into a north american union with mexico and canada

5432187 in my first couple of days at the camp im placed in a tent with officers i cant tell anybody apart they all look the same in their desert camouflage fatigues most of the officers seem to be square jawed blue eyed white guys in their mid to late twenties the initial reason i strike up an acquaintance with lt fick is that hes easily recognizable he has a loping adolescent smile that you can spot from a hundred meters away hes one of fifty men to introduce themselves to me but hes the only one im able to call by name on my way to the mess tent and ask if i can join him for dinner
5432188 there is about him an air of victorian rectitude he grew up in an ultramodern 1970s house designed by his father an architect there was shag carpet in a conversation pit one of his fondest memories he later tells me is that before cocktail parties his parents would let him prepare the carpet with a special rake
5432189 all right if the jews must leave that means the guy on the cross and his mother behind me will have to go as well
5432190 how could he how could he don the garb of those who preached the crusades in centuries past
5432191 where i come from and from where i stand one cannot be jew and christian at the same time jesus was jewish but those who claim allegiance to him today are not in no way does this mean that jews are better or worse than christians but simply that each of us has the right if not the duty to be what we are
5432192 i feel jewish i refuse to renounce my roots my jewishness how could i betray my mothers memory it would be cowardly and humiliating
5432193 as a child my jewishness meant being persecuted historically and personally from which i have no desire to escape for one instant
5432194 it was an unbearably painful scene when he told his parents he explained that he was not abandoning being a jew but discovering its real meaning his parents did not understand and he suffered greatly from their pain he took the step only because he felt it was absolutely necessary for his soul
5432195 to see a country collapse that everything comes crashing down that those vested with the truth become liars those vested with courage become cowards those vested with justice become traitors those entrusted with the public good abandon the people
5432196 i saw all of this with my own eyes and it is probably what most traumatized me
5432197 for me it dealt with the same spiritual subject the same benediction the same stakes the salvation of men the love of god the knowledge of god the identification between the suffering messiah and persecuted israel the jewish people was something intuitive and immediate for me
5432198 he was despised and rejected by men a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering he was oppressed and afflicted yet he did not open his mouth he was led like a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is silent so he did not open his mouth
5432199 the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world
5432200 even if thats unacceptable for many for me the vocation of israel is bringing light to the goyim thats my hope and i believe that christianity is the means for achieving it
5432201 for me this nomination was as if all of a sudden the crucifix began to wear a yellow star
5432202 what is a jew if not a man with a calling for his fellow man for this reason he is rejected and persecuted and killed how could i wish to cease being jewish it is not mans prerogative to decide what he should be but first to god i have never desired to not be jewish
5432203 i am not leaving you i am not passing into the enemy camp im becoming what i am i am not stopping being a jew just the opposite im discovering a way of living it
5432204 ive always considered myself a jew even if thats not the opinion of some rabbis
5432205 i will come in my capacity as bishop to the conference but i will say to you who i am i am a jew whose mother you executed that is what you have done
5432206 to know him is a grace and a trial because he is not like us
5432207 i was born jewish i received the name of my paternal grandfather a yiddish speaking rabbi in silicia aaron having become christian by faith and baptism i have remained jewish as did the apostles

5432308 artinya taatlah kepada pemimpin yang begini begini kurang lebih beliau mengartikannya begitu maka dari itu karena sampai sekarang belum ada manusia pemimpin seperti yang diartikan dalam ayat ayat setan tadi sayapun memutuskan bahwasanya tidak berdosa jikalau tidak taat pada pemimpin yang model jaman sekarang
5432309 lagipula ketika saya bekerja menimba air dirumah ngantar anak cucu dsb dsb itu dapat pahala dasarnya ayat ini hadist itu
5432310 tapikan meninggalkan tugas kantor ini bapak malahan dapat dosa karena tidak mentaati peraturan
5432311 makanya peraturan yang bagaimana dulu selama masih peraturan buatan manusia maka tidak sempurna maka tidak berdosa melanggar peraturannya lagipula saya punya alasan jelas untuk terlambat yaitu mengurus keluarga ya macam ngantar anak cucu ke sekolah tadi
5432312 ibu lulusan stpdn itu juga ngantar 2 anaknya dulu pak beliau perempuan lagi tapi datangnya selalu tepat waktu

5432320 you cannot incorporate all the events all the business processes all the services on day one you have to prioritize and figure out where youll get the best bang for your buck
5432321 when an order is entered and suppose this order was entered in a crm system like seybold it has a certain presentation of how the order looks but that is not how all of your different systems think of an order
5432322 isolate your different systems from each other and link them to one common model so when something changes in one of the systems the only thing that you have to change is that particular interaction and nothing else
5432323 to expose my business functions and services in a standard way so anyone accessing these services from our side does not have to know how seybold works or how oracle apps works etc

5432331 we deliberately chose lithium ion cells with a slightly lower capacity than the largest cells available because theses smaller and more mature cells have better long term durability and higher tolerance for abuse

5432333 20 20 program on global warming good program aside from tesla part not being longer
5432334 we have enough geothermal in nevada to power the entire state in my opinion
5432335 between geothermal wind and solar we shouldnt be using any fossil fuel in nevada but not all states are that lucky
5432336 on a national basis we need to figure out how to take care of this issue because there are tremendous amounts of renewable geothermal and wind energy resources in this country that are locked up in areas that dont have adequate transmission to get out
5432337 the ferc is overseeing two of the worlds largest machines the gas pipeline system and the electric grid stystem and just a 5 improvement in efficiency in either one of those machines or both of them are huge gains for this country and things im really trying to focus on

5432341 im a little surprised that the extra weight affects the range so dramatically some 20 percent while acceleration remains unchanged i would have thought the opposite that the acceleration would be much lower but the range only a little reduced
5432342 we dont want to have anything to do with anything that burns fuel
5432343 changing weight from 2500 lbs to 2700 lbs should proportionally increase just rolling resistance component by 8
5432344 the benefit of going hybrid is substantial even when compared to so called zero emissions vehicles an all electric is 1 10 as dirty as a conventional vehicle while an hev can be about 1 8 as polluting
5432345 we put in another 110 of the most powerful li ion cells in the world to make a total of 990 a123 systems m1 cells in the bike this pushed the power output to over 350 hp we are now able to draw 1575 amps from the 375 volt 7 5 kw hr battery pack there are just 161 lbs of cells in this pack we call the a123 systems battery pack mister fusion because it acts like a bottomless pit of power and energy on the track
5432346 at more than 200 miles the tesla roadster will still have the highest range of any production ev in history by a large margin
5432347 even with the demands of charging and discharging the battery pack on a daily basis the batteries in the tesla roadster will give you more than 100 000 miles of peak performance driving after that point the battery will see only gradual drops in performance over time

5432377 circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of god
5432378 and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him

5432398 the science and technology committee was one of congresss responses to the soviet unions successful launch of sputnik 1 in late 1957 sputnik led to a national reexamination of americas educational system our scientific research infrastructure and our goals and capabilities for space exploration and this committee was given the responsibility of leading congressional oversight of those issues
5432399 nasa has been one of the most significant engines of scientific and technological progress in america over the past fifty years investments made in nasa since 1958 have produced achievements that have profoundly affected our daily lives whether through the practical benefits of nasas meteorological satellite r amp d and its remote sensing satellites or due to the innumerable improvements nasa has made to our civil and military aircraft technologies improvements that have made them safer faster more efficient and more environmentally friendly
5432400 at the end of day nasa and its programs are still recognized around the world as a shining symbol of american preeminence in science and technology we need to ensure that that continues to be the case
5432401 in that regard i am pleased that the house of representatives passed the committees bipartisan nasa authorization act by an overwhelming margin because i believe that bill will help provide positive guidance to the next administration regarding the importance of investing in our nations civil space and aeronautics programs
5432402 nasa is one of the crown jewels of the nations research enterprise and it is a symbol of mankinds quest for innovation and understanding that is recognized and appreciated throughout the world
5432403 i think we owe a debt of appreciation to all the men and women of nasa its contractors and the universities and research institutions that have made it all possible

5432446 no one wants to think about losing their job but todays science and engineering graduates could face an uncertain future im sure we all agree that we must find a way to help our current and future science and engineering workers better understand the challenges and opportunities facing them in the twenty first century

5432464 but i have to go with my heart who is the person thats most aligned with my values and i think has the best chance of beating norm because of those values
5432465 ive talked to a lot of people i think people are rightfully concerned about whether al can win

5432468 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad

5432484 i want to speak to those quality standards very briefly we set three key quality standards in the department of defense and have since the mid 1990s these standards come out of 30 plus years of experience with what works in the volunteer force we aim to have 90 percent of the new enlistees meaning those without prior service the new enlistees in the department of defense have a high school diploma as a measure of whether they will succeed in our enterprise we aim to have 60 percent or more score above average on the armed forces qualification test the armed services vocational aptitude battery thats our version of the sat you might say and we aim to have less than 4 percent score in mental category iv thats between the 10th and the 30th percentile on that same examination in other words we aim for the military to draw an above average slice of america into its enlisted ranks thats setting aside the officers for whom we set even higher standards and who comprise about one eighth of our total strength and we made those standards in all force areas with one exception the army the active army did not meet the high school diploma standard it recruited in terms of non prior service enlistees 79 percent with high school diplomas thats approximately the national average and obviously wed like to do just a bit better but were proud of the record overall and it means the department as a whole met that record

5432487 a privately reported vulnerability in the bluetooth stack in windows
5432488 the bluetooth bulletin is the most interesting critical patch that deserves keen attention
5432489 the impact of a remote code execution in windows bluetooth could mean that its possible to attack a victims computer just by being within close proximity and not actually being on the network itself
5432490 even though the active directory bulletin is only marked as important this is something businesses will want to address primarily because active directory is such a business critical system and an attack could potentially grind networks to a halt
5432491 vulnerability that could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted web page
5432492 nothing particularly shocking this month except for me being shocked that i actually tend to agree in the context of the severity of patch designations i think microsoft got it right this time
5432493 an important thing to note is that four of the seven bulletins are server side vulnerabilities meaning no user interaction is required for a system to be hacked hackers have more fun with server side issues

5432502 this study is the first to examine in young children both the neural response to pain in others and the impact of someone causing pain to someone else
5432503 who caused the pain an fmri investigation of empathy and intentionality in children
5432504 consistent with previous functional mri studies of pain empathy with adults the perception of other people in pain in children was associated with increased hemodymamic activity in the neural circuits involved in the processing of first hand experience of pain including the insula somatosensory cortex anterior midcigulate cortex periaqueductal gray and supplementary motor area
5432505 although our study did not tap into explicit moral judgment perceiving an individual intentionally harming another person is likely to elicit the awareness of moral wrongdoing in the observer
5432506 thirteen of the children thought that the situations were unfair and they asked about the reason that could explain this behavior

5432566 the american public understands the importance of air safety and our citizens want to be sure that the government and the aviation industry are doing all that can be done to keep the air transportation system safe
5432567 could materially affect the public confidence in and the commercial welfare of the air carriers
5432568 part of nasas job is to make sure planes fly safely and by 2025 there will be three times as many planes in the air i want to know why naoms was shut down after we spent 11 3 million in taxpayer money and 24 000 pilots voluntarily took a 30 minute survey but before learning what the pilots had to tell us about aviation safety
5432569 nasa has a very important responsibility to protect public safety and to be held accountable for taxpayer funds neither of these obligations has been met in nasas handling of the aviation study the safety of the public has to be our first priority especially with more and more americans flying every year although administrator griffin delivered the data to the committee i call on him to make the entire study public as soon as possible so airlines can take the proper precautions to protect their passengers
5432570 the fact here is that nasa has created a situation by its misstatements that has alarmed and concerned the american people particularly air travelers
5432571 it is the administrators responsibility to take every immediate action to clear up the confusion that nasa has created and get all of this information out for public review he should order batelle to work around the clock 24 7 to get the information released the longer we wait the worse this situation becomes the taxpayers have paid over 11 million to create this database and it needs to be released so we can learn from it

5432617 maintaining the pressure on the commercialization of pure zev technologies
5432618 the proposed amendments to the zev program are projected by carb staff to reduce the cost of compliance for automobile manufacturers
5432619 because the proposed amendments are anticipated to reduce costs faced by california businesses they would have no adverse impact on the ability of california businesses to compete with businesses in other states
5432620 it seems clear that you have been misinformed about the availability of pure zevs and that the staff has erred in recommending that the board substantially loosen for years to come requirements that can in fact be met today
5432621 the staff proposals if enacted will have a severe adverse impact on tesla the only car maker based in california since having the ability to sell the accumulated zev rights

5432626 furthermore tesla motors expects to exceed the zev regulation requirement for pure zevs solely with its own volumes
5432627 with all due respect tesla motors failed to ship vehicles months ago when they promised and you only have one vehicle delivered with over 2 months of no further deliveries to show if i were carb i would consider your vehicles as still prototypes as you are not continuously rolling them off the production line since no other manufacturer has as conventionally performing zev in production carb has no choice but to push back their mandates way to go you only needed to start production in october to convice carb you were for real but you failed
5432628 the manufacturers knew of these requirements for years and should they really wanted to comply they certainly have much more financial and engineering resources than tesla yet tesla has done it

5432633 story filed 3 21 2008 2 21 22 pm est by perry stern could mitsubishi bring its i car to america successfully at the 2008 new york international auto show mitsubishi revealed it is looking to the u s market as a possible fit for the companys tiny 4 passenger car the i and if theres a place for the diminutive car on u s roads then perhaps there might also be a market for an electric version already sold in japan where it has gained considerable popularity the i car is about 10 inches shorter than a mini cooper but makes excellent use of available space four adult passengers fit easily in the i car while still allowing for a bit of cargo although only a grocery bag or two headroom is quite plentiful due to the shape the shape is even possible in this small of a package because the engine sits below the floor and just forward of the rear axle this allowed designers to give the rear wheel drive i car a larger passenger compartment while putting the wheels at the corners the other advantage to this rear mid engine layout converting to an electric version of the i car does not require any major structural changes so mitsubishi replaced the gasoline powered engine with an electric motor powered by lithium ion batteries stored under the floor this new version of the i car is called the i miev mitsubishi innovative electric vehicle an even more interesting advantage when converting the i car into the i miev with the batteries in the floor the center of gravity is lowered so much the electric version actually handles better than its gas powered sibling mitsubishi plans to put the i miev on sale in japan late next year but to get an early indication of the viability of this car in america the company brought a few cars to the new york show msn autos editors got the chance to take this little car for a spin around manhattan and found the car would probably feel right at home zipping and lunging between the taxicabs of the big apple on the road the i miev is unnervingly quiet even for an electric car however it operates just like any other car turn the key shift into drive and away it goes because electric cars provide peak torque almost immediately the i miev is quick during our test drive we had no problem keeping up with new york traffic since the i miev can accelerate from a standstill faster than most larger cars the i does feel quite small going wheel to wheel with mammoth delivery trucks suvs and taxis but being small has definite advantages in the city during our drive we rolled up to a taxi that had broken down in the middle of the street a larger car would have had to turn around but at less than five feet wide the i miev easily maneuvered around the disabled cab mitsubishi claims the range of the current lithium ion batteries to be around 80 miles charge time varies depending on the power source to fully charge the i miev with a standard 110 outlet takes about 14 hours hooking up to a 220 volt power source common in most houses for plugging in the clothes dryer cuts the time to seven hours quick chargers are currently being developed that could cut the time to 30 minutes mitsubishi will be leaving a few of these electric i mievs in the u s for fleet testing with a utility company and will continue to assess the market for small cars as well as electric cars

5432650 30 70 mph is the real world region many of us will notice a lot more than 0 60
5432651 i dont know what their procedure is with respect to automatics but if they are letting them downshift for the test and that doesnt seem right

5432653 what about hooking up with nanosolar and figuring out how to use their new flexible solar electric cell foil called nanosolar solarply which would allow the tesla to charge itself for free with our most abundant of natural resources the sun
5432654 having your corvette in 6th at 30 and then punching it to 70 without downshifting is not
5432655 we do not disagree on times that it would take to accelerate or not what we are saying is that the test its self is bogus
5432656 when the cars are in their best gear for that acceleration run
5432657 the tesla is a very fast accelerating car by any standards and does not need to be compared with other cars that are in the wrong gear what on earth would that possibly prove

5432666 the oft quoted number of 0 60 in 4 seconds is impressive but unfairly limited since the real heart flutters begin after that but clearly this car will sling itself up to three digit territory like a ride at six flags over hell
5432667 and its acceleration from 40 to 60 was commendably quick as well
5432668 the media should be asking about the viability of the technology and the verifiability of claims
5432669 if were worried about global warming or western dependence on foreign resources we need a big majority of road vehicles to move away from fossil fuel not just some classes of them for some jobs this means that hydrogen biofuels or some other sort of kit will have its place probably alongside or hybridised with electric vehicles or just perhaps largely bypassing them

5432678 i wouldnt recommend them as a dessert topping but the tesla motors lithium ion cells are not classified as hazardous and are landfill safe however dumping them in the trash would be throwing money away since the battery pack can be sold to recycling companies unsubsidized at the end of its greater than 100 000 mile design life moreover the battery isnt dead at that point it just has less range

5432683 the ev1 was the benchmark in battery technology and was a tremendous achievement even so electric vehicles in general had limitations they had limited range limited room for passengers or luggage couldnt climb a hill or run the air conditioning without depleting the battery and had no device to get you home when the batterys charge ran low

5432827 this committee was instrumental in establishing the national nanotechnology initiative through legislation enacted in 2003
5432828 with regard to risk reduction research a key provision of the bill is to require that nni develop a plan for the environmental and safety research component and a roadmap for implementing it which includes explicit near term and long term goals and the funding required by goal and by agency
5432829 the bill would assign responsibility to a senior official at the office of science and technology policy to oversee this planning and implementation process
5432830 we need to ensure that this nation successfully capitalizes on the commercial developments that will flow from the new discoveries resulting from our substantial investment in research it is now time to give increased consideration to rebalancing nni investments toward activities to foster the transfer of new discoveries to commercial products and processes
5432831 h r 5940 is an excellent bipartisan bill that will improve and strengthen nni and thereby help keep the united states at the forefront of nanotechnology
5432832 to date we have received letters of support for the bill from the semiconductor industry association the nanobusiness alliance the american chemical society and the national science teachers association

5432850 in mr depps portrayal words come first in the shaping of a phrase expression nuance intention and controlled intensity matter more than vocal richness and sustaining power these principles of vocal artistry matter just as much onstage as the best operatic artists understand but too many opera singers are overly focused on making beautiful sounds and sending notes soaring at the expense of crisp diction and textual clarity they could learn something from mr depps verbally dynamic singing i dont mean to suggest that his vocal performance is merely a savvy kind of sung speech there is musical distinction in his work

5432854 it doesnt matter what the majority of the worlds governments think about israels occupation of palestine and state sponsored terrorism the united states will continue to support it using our veto vote on the united nations security council to ensure no action is taken against them thereby making sure our 1 military base in oilsville stays open
5432855 hamas is not a state hamas is a terrorist organization
5432856 i have as little respect for democracy as george bush i dont care if hamas was voted in by the majority of palestinians in the january 2006 popular elections i only like democracy when people who agree with the united states interests win

5432903 by encouraging research and development of technologies to improve water use efficiency we are in fact increasing our nations water supplies without having to identify a single new source of fresh water
5432904 utah is the nations second driest state in the face of rapid growth drought and climate change predictions if we want to keep the taps flowing tomorrow we need to take advantage of every available water efficiency technology today
5432905 the united states led the world in developing and implementing revolutionary water management systems throughout the 2 nd half of the 20 th century the question before us is whether the u s is going to give up its leadership in this critical area this is path that we are on but it can be reversed with a fairly modest set of actions by the federal government
5432906 we want to be sure that these products meet the high standard set by renntech mercedes products which is very high
5432907 every product has to do something that adds to the performance of the car
5432908 customers can lower the car so it is level or lower the front more than the rear for a raked look some customers might want to lower the rear of the car for more weight transfer at a drag strip the lowering module lets them do that

5432927 okay that wasnt so bad lets run one more 8 15 mile
5432928 something else i notice is that the 3 9 second 0 to 60 mph time of the roadster actually understates its performance relative to a gasoline car with the same quoted time the reason is that there is no clutch engagement delay with the roadster because there is no clutch i did some side by side acceleration tests with a friend of mine that has a corvette supposedly with a similar 0 to 60 mph time as the roadster and it was no contest

5432940 what is the matter this is joyous news gilbert i have met coblaith and she is quite pretty
5432941 you know much more than farming in fact you are much more interesting than i was at your age
5432942 dont worry the marriage will not take place until you are back from the monastery and done with your learning you have plenty of time to adjust to the idea i tried to pick the best for you and joining her family is a good way to secure a more permanent anchor here in leinster
5432943 she was concerned but i explained to her the importance of it and i think she is accepting it she understands that there are things we need to do for the sake of the kingdom the normans are very powerful now we need to accommodate them or the kingdom could be in danger
5432944 well i dont really feel like a norman anymore i have come to love this country and even though i have only been here a short time i feel like this is my home
5432945 and yes he did allow me to rule leinster after king macmurrough died but any one of these land driven nobles can try to take it away king henry is occupied with the problems of england if a norman baron is in his favor at the moment he may grant our land to him citing that we are being non compliant to the english laws and requests
5432946 i will do whatever is necessary even if it means i have to leave for a while i know how important this kingdom is to you
5432947 we are doing well sir please sit down some tea perhaps
5432948 no thank you i am here for just a moment to talk with you about something i feel is important
5432949 no worries michan i have come to offer your daughter a chance to attend a newly established school at a monastery on the west coast
5432950 i dont understand a place to learn away from here
5432951 would they allow her to go i make meager wages
5432952 that is why i am here i would like to send her and pay the costs involved if you agree that is
5432953 that is awfully generous of you but i was barely able to work off what i owed you before
5432954 i am offering it to you as a gift not a loan
5432955 patrick i wanted to speak to you about an important opportunity
5432956 i want you to leave here and move to a place on the west coast a place where you will be able to learn much more than you know now
5432957 i dont quite understand father you want me to leave the abbey
5432958 well this is a place to learn i want you to go there because i feel that you would benefit you are a smart boy patrick this will be a great experience for you
5432959 where is this and who else is going is gilbert going
5432960 i am neither noble nor wealthy why do i have to go
5432961 you live here with us therefore you are expected to attend they have asked all of the priests for help to encourage this venture and you are a part of this abbey instead of joining a monastery you will be increasing your knowledge for the good of the church perhaps when you come back you will be ready for something more than just a caretaker
5432962 i am not sure of that yet i can tell you it will be longer than a year
5432963 a year how will almaith accept that especially since we have been talking about marriage
5432964 my advice to you would be to explain the situation to alamith and then meet with her father before you leave make your intentions known patrick and there will be no problem with you leaving especially if it for the sake of bettering your position here in the village

5432967 the expected introduction of plug in hybrid electric vehicles could cut u s gasoline use but could increase deadly air pollution in some areas two reports say
5432968 the minnesota study found that use of phevs would lower most emissions compared with other vehicles but that resulting so2 emissions would be more than double those from gasoline vehicles and about three or four times greater than from driving a regular hybrid
5432969 the minnesota study also found that phevs would emit more carbon dioxide co2 than driving a conventional hybrid
5432970 the nrdc calculus shows that a plug in charged from a power plant burning the dirtiest type of coal still has an overall pollution level less than a conventional gasoline car but it would produce 11 more greenhouse gas emissions than a regular non plug in hybrid according to luke tonachel vehicles analyst at the nrdc and co author of the groups report on plug ins the report was produced jointly with the non profit electric power research institute

5432975 as was alluded to in the customer town hall meeting last week tesla will likely provide both pure electric and range extended electric drive options in the future
5432976 however this series parallel approach suffers from the inherent problem that the energy is transformed from mechanical at the ic shaft into electrical and then back to mechanical at the ev motor the energy will in the best case go through the generator ev motor controller and ev motor in the worst case it will also cycle in and out of the batteries all of these conversions deal a serious blow to the best efficiency possible for a typical ev system you will need between 1 2 and 2 3 of the ic horsepower to simply push the car as you will to generate enough electricity to drive it

5432986 well so far its still the only independently verified numbers and even being the worst case i think its a good start to assume worst case first im aware that they were running it hard with the heater on etc factoring in that they didnt completely deplete the packs i remember it was still only around 120miles or something so around 100 miles is good enough representation
5432987 i think people look at the epa cycle for regular ice cars and have found over the years that it simply does not reflect reality they know that this is with absolutley perfect driving by well skilled professionals with the intent of squeezing every last mile out of a gallon

5432990 dont conform and do whats expected just because its expected of you
5432991 now id like to address two repeated arguments against electric vehicles battery disposal and power plant emissions the answer to the first is short and simple the second requires a bit of math batteries that are not toxic to the environment i wouldnt recommend them as a dessert topping but the tesla motors lithium ion cells are not classified as hazardous and are landfill safe however dumping them in the trash would be throwing money away since the battery pack can be sold to recycling companies unsubsidized at the end of its greater than 100 000 mile design life moreover the battery isnt dead at that point it just has less range

5433006 with half of the play taking place in former czechoslovakia rock n roll brings us back to one of the defining moments in our lives when we left the country in 1976
5433007 the czech characters in the play encounter events very similar to experiences of our closest friends who remained in prague tom himself was born in czechoslovakia and he has long been impressed by our personal story of immigrants coming to a foreign place knowing nobody and creating a theater it is the perfect play to mark our 30th anniversary season

5433009 his love of england and of english ways his memories of his mother baking buchty a type of pastry and his nostalgia for his last summer and winter as an english schoolboy are mine
5433010 there was a time when i thought it would be rather neat to write my fake autobiography as a play because i left czechoslovakia when i was a baby and my czech father was killed in the far east in the war we were living in the far east and i guess if my mother hadnt after the war married my stepfather maybe we would have gone back to czechoslovakia and for a while i thought it would be quite interesting to write this as a play about myself as though at the age of eight id gone to czechoslovakia instead of england jan is born pretty much close to me in the same little town
5433011 when tom was writing rock n roll he was in contact with jiri and me and we had the privilege of reading his first drafts from the very beginning we made it clear to tom that we wanted to produce the play at the wilma
5433012 absurdly assigned to the department of forbidden books where there was nothing to clean since no one was allowed to enter the room

5433055 the roadsters all electric engine doesnt free wheel so the car slows when pressure diminishes on the accelerator
5433056 the wording on this press release is a bit vague does that say that the absolute maximum is 4 000 or is the maximum 4 000 plus 250 per extra kwh between 4 and 50 i e for a tesla roadster is the maximum credit 4 000 or is the maximum 15 500 4 000 50 4 250 because 15 500 would go a long way toward making the roadster far more affordable 92 000 15500 77 500 putting it in competition with slightly more mainstream cars like the cadilac xlr and bmw 6 series rather than the more exotic maserati and panoz but much more striking than what it would do to the roaster is how much of a kick it would give to the white star think of the difference in market size between 50k and 35k its huge

5433291 if the reason is that then it looks your answer to the question
5433292 because that my arm hurt supported my going to the doctor
5433293 what was your normative reason for going to the doctor
5433294 well my arm hurt so i thought id better see the doctor if thats what you mean
5433295 that means that agents always act for normative reasons but sometimes those normative reasons are not the case if you can make sense to what that second sentence actually means then youve done better than dancy
5433296 moreover i think and ive argued elsewhere that the only view that doesnt force us to reject very plausible views in the philosophy of mind and epistemology is the propositional view
5433297 look we jews reject jesus because we are jews and being jewish means that we reject jesus

5433307 web services are a way of making an eai implementation snappier more standards based and a little quicker to implement
5433308 what youre doing is adding a veneer a facade on top of stuff that already exists
5433309 thats completely untrue if i were you i would just laugh heartily when someone says that web services are definitely a valuable tool within an eai solution but not a complete replacement if you look at them as a complete replacement youre going to get burned

5433320 your 4 year old has threatened to cut her up so many times that she is seriously afraid of him and while i am not an overprotective parent i do not see any reason to subject her to that level of violence

5433336 studies in american indian literature critical essays and course designs
5433337 the sacred hoop recovering the feminine in american indian traditions
5433338 this is a profound loss for the american indian academic and creative community
5433339 professor gunn allen was one of the most widely respected and accomplished scholars and writers in the history of american indian studies in this country
5433340 to say that paula gunn allen is multi talented and to claim that she has had a major impact on the field of american literature are two statements that vastly over simplify and understate her stature and importance
5433341 in fact what can accurately be said of paula gunn allen that her work as a poet and novelist helped create basic texts in native american literature and that her work as critic and anthologist has been instrumental in promoting the study and understanding of that literature cannot be said of many other academics in any field let alone in american literature
5433342 when paula arrived at ucla she was sublimely misfitted to be a professor in this particular department of english and it was for this reason i came to value her first as her colleague then later as her boss
5433343 she grounded us or was it that she sky ed us at least those of us who could reach down or up in our imaginations
5433344 the learned life for paula was never something abstract but always personal spiritual
5433345 the country is speaking loudly and clearly the american people are rejecting the special interests and the bureaucratic status quo in washington the question for you now is what are you going to do about it
5433346 congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote
5433347 with the majoritys refusal to stop the earmarks the circle is now complete the leaders of the democratic majority who once promised to change the status quo in washington spending have become its champion
5433348 house republicans have changed too we fully recognize the failure to control earmarks helped cost our party the majority and dramatic change is needed

5433414 discussing money in general is fine as long it is suited to the nature of the situation and the conversation
5433415 if everyone is participating in a conversation about mortgages around the dinner table feel free to join in but never reveal too much you dont want to be labeled as someone who always talks about money and it could be embarrassing for others if you were to suddenly reveal you salary overdraft limit bonus and mortgage repayments in great detail
5433416 the wealthier may be viewed as bragging or making others feel jealous those with less may feel pitied or make the better off feel guilty
5433417 keeping money talk general avoids these unnecessary and negative feelings

5433424 at what point would one consider that one had a duty to the spouse and children who were not nominally clients doesnt there come a time when formal adherence to professional privilege is actually a breach of the duty to be aware of the interests of other parties
5433425 if as an accountant or banker lawyer or other non private relationship one came into possession of information which indicated that a spouse was arranging their affairs in such a way as to benefit themselves but leaving the spouse and children wanting or legally or financially vulnerable at what point would one consider that one had a duty to the spouse and children who were not nominally clients

5433448 the first step in this affair sufism is the breaking of ink pots and the tearing of books and forgetting of all kinds of knowledge
5433449 for the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason the story ends like a bad dream he has scaled the mountains of ignorance he is about to conquer the highest peak as he pulls himself over the final rock he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries
5433450 as we survey all the evidence the thought insistently arises that some supernatural agency or rather agency must be involved is it possible that suddenly without intending to we have stumbled upon scientific proof of the existence of a supreme being was it god who stepped in and so providentially crafted the cosmos for our benefit
5433451 when confronted with the order and beauty of the universe and the strange coincidences of nature its very tempting to take the leap of faith from science into religion i am sure many physicists want to i only wish they would admit it
5433452 it seems to me that when confronted with the marvels of life and the universe one must ask why and not just how the only possible answers are religious i find a need for god in the universe and in my own life
5433453 when i began my career as a cosmologist some twenty years ago i was a convinced atheist i never in my wildest dreams imagined that one day i would be writing a book purporting to show that the central claims of judeo christian theology are in fact true that these claims are straightforward deductions of the laws of physics as we now understand them i have been forced into these conclusions by the inexorable logic of my own special branch of physics
5433454 it might seem strange to some that a scientist and a jew could come to faith in jesus but faith is never a leap into the dark it is always based on evidence all people believe and all scientists believe they dont all believe in a personal god of course but each one of us uses our own measure of faith each one of us has a personal world system a personal belief system as a scientist i always think logically and i reason things out that was how my whole search for god began i looked through my telescope at saturn and said to myself isnt there a great god out there and when i studied relativity relativistic astrophysics cosmology and all these beautiful areas of mathematics they pointed me to the fact that this whole universe is masterfully made finely tuned and controlled by the great designer the logical next step was to want to meet this designer face to face
5433455 science and reason had little to do with my coming to trust in jesus
5433456 and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves and said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves

5433511 in the past few years wallace has bought an airplane and a bmw convertible he has changed so much since entering state house
5433512 the affair has been devastating in my eyes because i have always thought very highly of wallace
5433513 it has been my impression that mary ann has dedicated herself to carrying the burden of a fulltime career and raising a family so that her husband could keep his position in the legislature
5433514 an aquaintance told me that it was common knowledge that wallace was having an affair with someone in the house of representatives i was shocked mary ann told me a month later that she and wallace had separated we both realized by this time that wallace was not being discreet and it was time to do something permanent about the marriage
5433515 the lime has been activated we need to neutralize it
5433516 a guy who would call his wife a trollop and a c t just because she had ruffled his hair in front of five guys is not only a jerk but a dangerous hothead if he ever gets his finger on the button
5433517 and since the mainstream media has decided to give mccain a free pass i decided to stand up and if they gave me an open mike ask the question that the press refuses to touch
5433518 our country is in a serious crisis after nearly eight years of bush and america appears to be oblivious to the danger this guy mccain poses to our country
5433519 if i didnt get to ask mccain the question i wanted to ask at least the fliers would help spread the word about mccains hair trigger temper and the lack of respect for his young wife
5433520 this question goes to mental health and mental health care previously ive been married to a woman that was verbally abusive to me is it true that you called your wife a cunt

5433531 dont worry aoife everything will be as it should your father has a long way to go before he can reclaim his throne even if he did return he would be too busy to worry about your marriage plans he will have more on his mind than securing a husband for you

5433551 what about a motorcycle i talking about a full on american style electric chopper mostly the idea hasnt been tried because motocycles are already incredibly efficient whats the point of having a motocycle that gets the equivilent of 100 mpg when they already do at least 40 mpg
5433552 call me closed minded but ive come to have a lot of respect for the basic laws of physics
5433553 the super capacitors could be ready for practical use within one to five years according to the researchers
5433554 thanks for the straightforward response i have to admit that i am almost as impressed with tesla motors willingness to frankly discuss the science involved at an accessable level as i am with the roadster itself i really appreciate your discussions of the tradeoffs inherent in the engineering and design process your site is the best that i have found to honestly discuss the benefits limitations and trade offs of green transportation technologies albiet with an understandable pro electric bias

5433588 this looks like michael the captain of the linspire ship sees the boat sinking so he casually tells the passengers on the ship that hes just going on a quick supply run jumps on the only lifeboat with any cash and valuables paddles off to safety and leaves everyone else behind to sink
5433589 i predict this was done to 1 help robertson drain the company of its cash and resources when i left linspire we had a very profitable year and the company had millions in the bank i predict robertson has moved this money to himself family and his other companies leaving linspires minority shareholders with nothing 2 help robertson save face by issuing a linspire acquired by xandros press release instead of living with the public humiliation that linspire failed under his leadership although being outlasted by xandros isnt much less embarrassing such a press release will of course be meaningless unless the acquisition was substantial as a shareholder i will eventually find out 3 give xandros a press release and perhaps some way for them to spin this to investors to raise money
5433590 one of the reasons i resigned from linspire is that michael wanted to issue a dividend only to himself and his father in law
5433591 2 a few years back linspire had a 5 man independent board with three of the board members being outside of the company today michael robertson is the only board member so if youre looking for the board to be responsible youre banking on the ethics of this one man
5433592 given a handful of xandros stock the cash will magically be gone
5433593 a feeling it will take a lawsuit to sort all this out where is all the cash robertson did you take it squander it or use some legal maneuver to get it and leave the shareholders with nothing
5433594 xandros is already the third largest linux company in the world and that we may already be the largest private linux company in the world

5433596 i think that since we now know sen john mccain will be the nominee for the republican party national security will be front and center in this election we all know that and i think its imperative that each of us be able to demonstrate we can cross the commander in chief threshold
5433597 i believe that ive done that certainly sen mccain has done that and youll have to ask sen obama with respect to his candidacy
5433598 distinguished man with a great history of service to our country
5433599 both of us will be on that stage having crossed that threshold that is a critical criterion for the next democratic nominee to deal with

5433670 as i learned on toshiba web site they disconnected all li ion battery technology development and migrated to fuel cell solutions as electricity source for electronics so i do not believe any battery technology improvement would come as you mentioned as i see it now may be it is my mistake but anyway most prominent battery manyfacturers for electronics who developed li ion technology to the level it stands now are migrating into fuel cells one interesting approach in fuel cells for laptops i have seen is to use nabh4 water to nabo2 hydrogen chemical converter in combination with fuel cell the idea is to get 10 times energy capacity per unit of mass to generate electricity also recharging goes by cartridge replacement with some solid liquid substance in it so this approach sidesteps hydrogen delivery storage problems

5433716 fantastic misgovernment of the kind we have seen is not an accident nor is it the work of a few bad individuals it is the consequence of triumph by a particular philosophy of government by a movement that understands the liberal state as a perversion and considers the market the ideal nexus of human society this movement is friendly to industry not just by force of campaign contributions but by conviction it believes in entrepreneurship not merely in commerce but in politics and the inevitable results of its ascendance are first the capture of the state by business and second all that follows incompetence graft and all the other wretched flotsam that weve come to expect from washington its leaders laugh off the idea of the public interest as airy fairy nonsense they caution against bringing top notch talent into government service they declare war on public workers they have made a cult of outsourcing and privatizing they have wrecked established federal operations because they disagree with them and they have deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job

5433758 in the name of the mayor and moscow government i am saying that the city government will act decisively and in uncompromising manner as in previous years to stop attempts of conducting gay pride events because the absolute majority of the society does not accept such things gays way of life and their philosophy
5433759 amusing and outrageous that gays are going to conduct unsanctioned actions in various parts of moscow
5433760 they are trying to pressure their rules and visions on the society
5433761 there are statements of the religious and other organizations that in case gays are going to their parade they will be physically attacked there can be blood and this is not needed by anyone
5433762 moscow lives in peace and public order in case we need to use our power for that it will be used
5433763 strategy and tactics of moscow pride organisational committee has seriously changed
5433764 on april 18 we notified moscow mayor about the plans for public events on 1 and 2
5433765 then on tuesday this week we sent 15 more applications for the events on may 3 4 and 5
5433766 in the coming days we are going to notify moscow authorities about the conduct of five gay marches per day each day until the end of may
5433767 the right to conduct public events is the constitutional right of everyone and moscow authorities have no right according to the law to ban peaceful public events
5433768 this may we are going to realise our constitutional right to publicly march despite the bans which mr tsoi announced
5433769 the dates time and place where we go on the streets of moscow will be chosen spontaneously
5433770 five notifications which we send to moscow government for every day in may concern marches on different streets in the central parts of the city and at different times
5433771 we are going to continue our legal fight against the lawlessness of city officials all bans and there can be 155 of them by the end of may will be appealed in russian courts and then to the european court of human rights in strasbourg
5433772 we are going to demonstrate to the european court justices that moscows homosexual people are denied to publicly express themselves any day in any form on any street and at any time at the same time other political public and human rights organisations are allowed to realise their constitutional rights
5433773 with new tactics we will definitely conduct our march this year irrespective of the position of moscow authorities which contradicts russian constitution federal law on the conduct of public events and european convention on human rights
5433774 bans of moscow pride public events in may 2006 and may 2007 are now in the european court in strasbourg but no decision has yet been taken on them
5433775 after the latest insults from mr tsoi and unconstitutional decisions of moscow authorities i decided to continue the flight with even more strength
5433776 i can not leave those who were hoping for us and those who together with us tried to achieve respect for lgbt rights in russia

5433789 a voter should not use a candidates opposition to an intrinsic evil to justify indifference or inattentiveness to other important moral issues involving human life and dignity

5433836 of course if you know anything about caps you know that the discharge curve is a decreasing exponential once the voltage falls to 1 2 the max voltage you only have 25 of capacity left to use this residual 25 energy the current would increase to unacceptable high levels so for practical purposes the usable capacity is 112 kw hr

5433840 okay so far now lets make a smaller 40 mile pack the lifetime range of this pack is only 500 x 40 20 000 miles to get the same lifetime range a chevy volt with a 40 mile driving range would need batteries that are roughly six times as good 3 000 cycles as those in the tesla roadster not coincidentally the gm spokespeople say that they will launch the volt when they can get 3 000 to 4 000 cycles out of their battery system

5433867 there is a very real risk that the rtfo will make climate change worse not better
5433868 from next month british motorists will be forced to pump biofuels into their tanks with no way of knowing if the so called green fuels theyre using are actually worse for the climate than regular fossil fuels for one of the governments top scientists to describe these plans as potentially insane suggests that something has gone seriously wrong here the targets should be scrapped pressing ahead regardless of the consequences for the climate would be incredibly reckless
5433869 biofuels threaten untold damage to unique wildlife habitats across the world their production is already causing the destruction of rainforest peatlands and grasslands and the release of huge amounts of carbon stored by trees and soil thousands of people last week urged the government to shelve its plans to force us to buy more biofuel ministers must heed those pleas not bulldoze through more biofuel use
5433870 it would be irresponsible to press ahead with volume targets for biofuels in the uk and the eu while there is no scientific consensus about their climate impacts and at a time when experts are still scratching their heads about how to adequately safeguard against their potentially catastrophic impacts on people and the environment
5433871 the rtfo should be delayed until the government can guarantee that the uks biofuels will neither make climate change worse nor come at the expense of the environment and the livelihoods of people in developing countries
5433872 the governments chief scientific advisor professor john beddington has warned about the impacts of biofuels on food security just at a time when the worlds poorest people are faced with rocketing prices of their basic foods in addition recent reports doubt the ability of biofuels to reduce greenhouse gases the government needs to look before it leaps in committing to biofuels
5433873 my grandmother said it was when the bottom of our world fell out
5433874 my oldest brother basically went ballistic just wanting answers right away
5433875 my other brothers response was hes dead put it behind you my mothers response was a certainty that he was going to come home there are so many different facets of dealing with this loneliness emptiness bitterness anger you can meet 10 families in the same situation and get a different attitude from each one
5433876 its different when you dont have a body theres finality in words but not in what you see when i walked away from bills grave site i didnt feel any sense of closure
5433877 you just know theres no closure there like its not personal
5433878 we were taught that you cant do anything about things like this so we basically went on with our lives
5433879 we just thought theyd be able to bring him back eventually the years kept passing and i guess we gave up really
5433880 i am again requesting records on my brother so i can place a memorial in our family plot
5433881 i just need to know a date of death please
5433882 occasionally its sad to say a family is trying to reach the wrong agency of the government and this is why theyre not getting answers
5433883 its our hope that the more we talk to veterans organizations and the more we talk to family groups the less that will happen
5433884 i told him there was one fellow in my life and told him we were in love with each other and had he survived things would have been all different for my future for our future
5433885 i dont think there was a dry eye in there
5433886 it sounds funny to say this but i truly hadnt had closure up until then
5433887 it would just be a good feeling to know while im still here that no part of him is still over there
5433888 its one of those things thats a part of the family heritage but something that is definitely in the past
5433889 i think again its an expression of the frustration of most of the taxpayers and legal citizens who say look this is a sanctuary city
5433890 i think the people in the hispanic community are scared to death about the gang bangers and the foreign nationals and the smugglers who are here preying on their loved ones and their family and friends
5433891 plaintiffs will lose out on a fair amount of exposure and the opportunity to express their views in a popular forum
5433892 forcing saddleback to include another candidate at the last moment could cause serious logistical problems and take away from the presentations of other candidate this might well disrupt the planned presentation
5433893 will have many other opportunities in the coming months to express their views and make their candidacy known
5433894 oh how i love your law i meditate on it all day long
5433895 do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them
5433896 so then the law is holy and the commandment is holy righteous and good
5433897 your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path
5433898 so the law was put in charge to lead us to messiah that we might be justified by faith
5433899 the time is coming declares the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of lsrael and with the house of judah i will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts

5433929 being a pop star is a crash and burn sort of lifestyle

5433931 it was ever thus if you look back to victorian times byron shelley those kind of people being creative requires living on the edge in a way that being in insurance doesnt
5433932 you could argue that rock stars and pop stars have a sensation seeking personality that they have this desire to put themselves in these terrifying situations performing in front of a large group of people that also makes them vulnerable to dependence on substances which markedly increases mortality
5433933 might be explained by differences in longer term experience of fame with more performing in later years continued media interest and associated stress and substance use in north american pop stars
5433934 many u s musicians die in poverty and there is not the same type of public health provision there
5433935 the music business would do well to take the health risks of substance abuse and risk taking behaviors more seriously

5434005 this is arguably the most important year ever for gulf in motorsport the famous gulf racing colours first tasted victory at le mans in 1968 so 2008 already had great significance for us but for gulf to have joined up with aston martin racing for this year is fantastic the coming together of two great automotive names for what i hope will be a long and fruitful partnership
5434006 endurance racing is engrained in the heritage of both gulf and aston martin and we have also both been intrinsically linked through le mans for many decades it was perhaps destined that in the year we defend our gt1 title and gulf celebrates the 40th anniversary of its win we would finally race together at la sarthe

5434142 there have been other incidents there too in the recent past
5434143 i am very annoyed because ive put so much time and effort to build this place up from what it was
5434144 it does us no favours at all it happened outside the pub but it does put people off coming to the area
5434145 this was a deliberate attack which must have terrified those who were out last night enjoying a drink and it is fortunate that the victim was not more seriously injured
5434146 let me reassure people that there will be increased patrols in the area and officers will be available at the mobile police station if anyone has any information
5434147 we are doing everything we can to try and track down those responsible for this attack but we also need the publics help do you know whos done this if you do you must contact us
5434148 you may think you heard or saw something insignificant but it might be important to our investigation
5434149 this is not a new problem particularly on ocean boulevard

5434156 environment california is getting behind policies that combine incentives for builders to invest in solar power with new standards for the building industry to begin incorporating solar power into new construction building with solar power makes a lot of sense to begin with it saves money it is a lot cheaper some estimate 25 33 percent cheaper to install a solar system before rather than after a building or home has been wired and constructed in addition some solar systems actually look and act just like roofing material saving money there as well secondly building with solar allows the architect to design the building appropriately by taking such simple steps as orienting the home or building in the right direction and landscaping to shade the home but not the solar system designers if they know ahead of time can help maximize the solar pv systems energy output finally given all the problems associated with the building of new fossil fuel power plants and the transmission and distribution lines needed to transport the energy great distances to electrify our homes and communities it makes a lot more economic and environmental sense to begin to build a small scale distributed energy system with clean renewable technologies such as solar pv
5434157 only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly
5434158 ive looked into adding solar panels to my home and turnkey quotes are on the order of 20 000 40 000 my electric bill is on the order of 150 month i calculate it would take quite a long time to recover costs unless the pv system turned into a money making machine
5434159 101 they owe me that much i have not paid any money for electricity in the last 3 years which is how long ive had the panels on my roof
5434160 elon although the amount of energy that could be recaptured from the top of the roadster is small i originally pushed very hard to have this option available martin argued that such panels would only be decoration
5434161 but does it have the energy density of li ion
5434162 i hope you consider some of the 50s design elements tail fins are cool bring em back amp suicide doors on a four five seater would be lovely
5434163 where are you planning to store the energy collected during the day

5434165 question how many solar panels do i need to power my tesla roadster martin the tesla roadster consumes about 200 watt hours per mile suppose you drove 35 miles per day on average 12 775 miles per year you would need to generate 2 6 mwh year by elons math monocrystalline solar panels generate about 263 kwh m2 year in the usa so you would need about 9 7 square meters of solar panels a square about 10 feet on a side to completely offset the energy consumed by your tesla roadster
5434166 effective friday june 15 tesla motors is increasing the base price of the tesla roadster from 92 000 to 98 000 we encourage you to submit your reservation on or before friday june 15 to secure your tesla roadster at the 92 000 price
5434167 many of these options actually offer a better watt ratio meaning you get more watts kilowatts per spent

5434242 yes we have your majesty they gave notice of their intentions to attack if demands are not met orourke wants the queen returned and he wants your immediate withdrawal from

5434244 what do you plan to do your majesty we dont have enough provisions for all of the inhabitants of the castle for more than a few weeks they could prolong this for much longer than that perhaps we should attack first with obrien and olochlain supporting us that way he wont take our lands and we wont starve
5434245 we will gain many more casualties that way sir we need to plan this wisely maybe a truce with some compromises your majesty
5434246 no i will not compromise i will stay in my land and i will keep his queen we have more men and we are equipped better i will let you know this evening whether i decide to attack or wait for his surrender for now ready the soldiers and animals for battle and add men to the garrison check on the provisions again and see to it that you find a way to stock it fully be gone there is much to do
5434247 oh and have the steward send for prince obrien and for my daughter urlachen at once

5434251 you said vows to each other how could you break them so easily
5434252 that matter is none of your business in fact that is not the reason i called for you i shouldnt have to explain anything to anyone i am your father and i am king
5434253 i think it is horrid what you have done to mother it is terrible that you have kept this woman in your life but to bring your lover here to live is shameful
5434254 urlachen i realize why you are angered you dont understand the ways of the world yet especially when you are in an exalted position you do what you have to do i was cheated in my marriage arrangement i was meant for another and had to sacrifice for the good of the kingdom most royal subjects forfeit happiness for duty you are different i found you a husband that will fit you unlike your sister she will need to marry for duty not for compatibility do you understand anything that i am saying
5434255 you arent being fair to mother your desires to be with this woman are killing her if you are so bitter about your marriage arrangement why would you force aoife to suffer the same the same way why wouldnt you look for someone she could love
5434256 duty it is her duty as the firstborn to sacrifice for our kingdom she may be joined with someone she will eventually learn to love now for the real reason i called you here
5434257 i have decided to set your wedding date for sunday i know it is short notice but there is an urgent situation at hand that requires us to expedite the ceremony i have called the prince here also to discuss the details his father has informed him this morning as well he should be here momentarily
5434258 am i being married now because of the approaching conflict i heard about it and i have to say father that i am scared and appalled that you would danger us all for this woman
5434259 i am father i have waited so long for this but i am still angry and i cannot accept what you are doing i cannot be happy while mother is so unhappy cant you send her back father it would ease mothers pain and bring to a halt this disagreement between you and king orourke i can then be joyfully married with my family and friends present and the whole kingdom can celebrate the occasion please reconsider father
5434260 its already done urlachen they want me exiled i cant reverse it i can only fight it i have to remain strong and unchallenged
5434261 your majesty he is riding into the palace gates now pardon the intrusion
5434262 father may i go to him i know we have not completed our conversation and there is more i wish to discuss with you perhaps later we can meet to discuss the situation more
5434263 yes go to your prince if we are to be conversing on the topics in which we have already addressed than no we will not meet later if you would like we could discuss the wedding details but we will not speak of the matters of the kingdom be gone go to your husband to be

5434339 fundamentalismus ist allgemein gesehen eine berzeugung die sich zu ihrer rechtfertigung auf eine grundlage beruft die auf einer letztbegr ndung beruhe und absolut wahr sei nicht nur religionen sondern auch philosophien weltanschauungen oder politische theorien vertreten so nicht selten den anspruch auf den besitz der absoluten wahrheit was praktisch einhergeht mit einer aufspaltung der mitmenschen in rechtgl ubige und falschgl ubige bzw im konfliktfall in freund und feind

5434360 uh im not sure what about one of those things what are they called a trollop
5434361 no a trolloc hmm im not sure whether thats a great idea
5434362 um well maybe we should base it on a pivotal event from the novel
5434363 yeah good idea so what does happen in the novel
5434364 sod it im bored now how about some bloke in an over sized shirt and tight trousers with a boy girl freaking out over a harmless looking bat
5434365 having worked with dirk for a number of years one of the benefits i clearly see is his expertise in the design engineering function its a great asset to have him closer to that area
5434366 we just grew to fast and didnt have the right processes in place
5434367 theyve got to get back to their success in 2004 2005 when they totally surprised intel with their chips for desktops and servers
5434368 we just grew to fast and didnt have the right processes in place
5434369 how can any entity be successful if the focus is playing dirty tricks show boating bragging and filing endless specious lawsuits meanwhile intel focuses on quality research production service and reliability we specify only intc products and have no rational expectation to become involved with the likes of amd
5434370 hey frank you oughta write a book about this stuff
5434371 but i wont i would never write or say anything against this business i wouldnt share our secrets our business our life with people on the outside

5434377 i cant promise you that youre going to see a massive turnaround in the short term
5434378 microsoft another year of unbelievable results while google misses on their own forecast
5434379 theres no doubt in my mind that a really positive effect of the iphone was to focus mainstream people on the idea of using their device for data
5434380 qualcomm could have spent huge amounts of money advertising 3g and not gotten the point across as well as the iphone has
5434381 we have no doubt that they only took these moves because of the developer attention theyve seen drained by apple and a little bit of android
5434382 while its great to have all those internet features i for one am not willing to pay those prices not all of us can afford 100 a month to have that kind of access on our phones
5434383 think about it 20 years ago you paid for phone service maybe cable but now you are paying for phone cable dish wireless internet and whatever else
5434384 google will get more value from android than apple will get from mobile osx even though android wont be released for another few quarters
5434385 the sprint instinct is a major competitor to the att iphone offering
5434386 you are not more sneaky than me i know what you did what you are doing and what you will do
5434387 i think that if you specialize too early you may think youre getting a boost in the short term but you will not be prepared in the long term for the kinds of varied careers that students are going to have in this century and certainly not be prepared for leadership roles in those careers
5434388 particularly in a world thats changing where students move from one career to another where the challenges keep shifting where the global issues confront us those challenges you cant provide for in on the job training
5434389 its not like these universities are making up these degrees and then thinking there will be some demand for it
5434390 its not enough that you made us to be poor now we have to endure a visit from the murderous cossacks
5434391 id better get my shabbos suit back from that crazy tailor

5434393 what if there is a plot by the czar to destroy our little shtetl
5434394 why should i worry about a situation that is not in my hands to control
5434395 our daily existence in the little shtetl of vaysechvoos is but an instant in the measure of time we will have with our creator so i should be upset with god because i might be taken away from the poverty and the pettiness of this life to live in a royal mansion in gan eden

5434401 punishments of torture and all others in the same line of unnecessary cruelty
5434402 punishments are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death something inhuman and barbarous and more than the mere extinguishment of life
5434403 was passed in the effort to devise a more humane method of reaching the result
5434404 similarly one mother when told that her childs killer would die by lethal injection asked
5434405 the most humane and practical method known to modern science of carrying into effect the sentence of death
5434406 well grounded belief that electrocution is less painful and more humane than hanging firing squad and lethal gas were in use at one time
5434407 there are no methods of legal execution that are satisfactory to those who oppose the death penalty on moral religious or societal grounds
5434408 complies with the constitutional requirements against cruel and unusual punishment
5434409 one must be on guard against finding in personal disapproval a reflection of more or less prevailing condemnation
5434410 the power of a state to pass laws means little if the state cannot enforce them

5434416 oh for gender and for women all over the world i think you know at least america is beginning to catch up with many other countries that have had women leaders
5434417 a great milestone was passed when a majority of voters came to believe a woman could be commander in chief this woman this hillary clinton who spoke so strongly so with such assurance about world affairs and who was a tough warrior
5434418 i think hillary clinton came into this campaign emotionally scarred from her eight years in the white house with that kind of attack constantly and all of the scandals and also having to compartmentalize what was going on with her husband and pretend it wasnt happening so she could keep getting up every day
5434419 we saw the ugly underbelly of you know this ugly stream thats been going on in american life for a long long time and she had to really take that to a higher level as she did when she went to china and talked about womens rights are human rights and human rights are womens rights
5434420 i think hillary clinton came into this campaign emotionally scarred from her eight years in the white house

5434451 at this point in time we do not see it replacing celeron
5434452 its not powerful enough for a great experience editing photos or viewing online video but intel designed it as a cheap way to get more people connected to the pc based internet
5434453 in this case the upgrade from atom is the centrino 2 platform which the intel unveiled on monday centrino 2 a combination of a processor chipset and wireless functions working together is intels mobile tour de force

5434582 well whats the deal with that how can you be jewish and believe in jesus
5434583 i concede its uncanny that my novels have a way of seeming to come true in some way shape or form but im not a psychic i dont call miss cleo in the middle of the night to get my plot ideas im an evangelical christian with an orthodox jewish heritage and im basing my novels on biblical prophecy
5434584 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son jesus and whoever believes in him shall not perish die eternally separated from god but have everlasting life
5434585 we considered him the messiah stricken by god smitten by him and afflicted
5434586 but he was pierced for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities the punishment that brought us peace was upon him and by his wounds we are healed
5434587 i didnt convert to anything jesus is the jewish messiah ive simply believed in the anointed one god sent to us

5434598 were talking about using web services program to program connections with web services being soap or xml for the message format as well as using different transports not necessarily just http but mq or iiop as the way of moving those messages to and from the host
5434599 is to access those critical business processes and that data from anywhere in the enterprise and this is where web services really give us a leg up new applications need to be able to incorporate host based business processes and by doing so increase your businesss agility while realizing significant return on the investment that youve made in your mainframe and your mainframe business processes

5434629 this is yet another farcical effort from a government worryingly hell bent on dragging the uk into an expensive and ill considered radioactive future
5434630 it is clear that the government are trying to mislead the public on the issue of nuclear waste and simply havent got a solution to dealing with stockpiles of this toxic legacy
5434631 they need to resolve the problems surrounding radioactive waste before they can make any decision to give the green light to new nuclear reactors

5434635 once upon a time movie comedies werent afraid of being crude prickly and downright savage to get a laugh if humor is sometimes directly tied to the misery of daily life our best clowns get battered but somehow find a way of walking through their struggles while maintaining a sense of hope and optimism that was true of charlie chaplin bill murray circa stripes where he wise assed his way through basic training in the army in search of sex and glory and the heroes of the farrelly brothers last great movie kingpin where the heroes crawled through all sorts of scatological tomfoolery in a quest to redeem themselves and when anyone asks me what the best film of this decade is so far i can never decide between the serious inland empire or the hilariously arcane courageously disgusting surrealistically absurd aqua teen hunger force colon movie film for theaters where nothing was off limits simply put ben stiller used to be unafraid of pointed mockery but nowadays he pulls his punches his new movie tropic thunder just isnt funny
5434636 every comedian secretly dreams of performing shakespeare the old saying goes
5434637 can we think of some interesting examples of the way real and imaginary geographies come together in films or the varied ways both realistic and artificial in which films approach geography any thoughts on the subject are welcome
5434638 a t no time are we ever in such complete possession of a journey down to its last nook and cranny as when we are busy with preparations for it after that there remains only the journey itself which is nothing but the process by which we lose our ownership of it this is what makes travel so utterly fruitless
5434639 we need to realise that people can be healthy at every size writes lily ohara
5434640 only people who are not aware of the intricacies of the bodys nanostructures will say this is a simple too much food is too fat or too little activity for as long as these simplistic notions are put about regrettably mostly by physicians we will get nowhere
5434641 the problem with being so focused on weight in relation to health is that is has done nothing to address the rise in average body weight in the past twenty years or so while nobody knows why this is happening
5434642 overweight elderly americans contribute to financial burdens of the us health care system being overweight or obese is not only a personal issue that affects ones health but is also a public health issue that impacts other people in society a new study in the journal health services research reveals that the extra medicare cost associated with overweight elderly people could place a significant financial burden on tax payers costing up to hundreds of billions of dollars across the entire current medicare population the articles findings show that treating the health needs of an overweight or obese elderly person will cost medicare 6 to 17 percent more over a lifetime than treating an elderly person with a healthy weight
5434643 you never see fat people coming out of a concentration camp
5434644 repeated studies demonstrate that fat people do not in fact eat more than slim people
5434645 get out and visit a few more schools and i would hasten to add make sure quite a few of them are in lower socio economic areas where you will see more food consumption with poorer choices
5434646 yen now poor people are fat well said maybe that is why some people are against fat people
5434647 oh well i may as well resign myself to a life of unhealth
5434648 if weight is genetic then how come the population keeps getting heavier
5434649 i once lived with a girlfriend who always served identical meal portions to both of us i was starving and she was gaining weight

5434652 is there enough oxygen for you at your exhaulted elevation
5434653 i can afford to be fat but i choose not to be unlike you hoi polloi who lack self control
5434654 all my life ive been an obese man trapped inside a fat mans body
5434655 being fat does not necessarily mean that you are bad or unacceptable or unhealthy
5434656 the problem with being so focused on weight in relation to health is that is has done nothing to address the rise in average body weight
5434657 being fat in our modern day with food everywhere was like being an alcoholic constantly in a liquor store
5434658 as a hospital professional in the operative setting id gladly trade in the rest of my career on slim chain smokers with dicky hearts than to treat happy go lucky obese people who are impossible to mobilise impossible to oxygenate and ultimately impossible to resuscitate
5434659 a significant proportion of the current government investment in public health is directed towards strategies with an almost exclusive focus on getting people exercising and eating properly
5434660 breakfast lunch dinner morning tea afternoon tea supper and between meal snacks probably
5434661 seems to me that theres not much anonymity available to an overeater telltale signs

5434663 if there is not too much head wind and not too many hills can you do 20 km in about one hour on a push bike
5434664 any idea of what the average lifespan of said hunter gatherer was
5434665 minimum of 25km a day eh whod be working thatd stuff up the capitalist economy big time
5434666 forego the well worn tried and tested paths of diet and exercise in favour of joyous physical activity and eating whatever the hell you like is not
5434667 repeated studies demonstrate that fat people do not in fact eat more than slim people
5434668 people are selfish they dont care for each other but
5434669 if i am driving home and i see smoke coming out from houses and people screaming fire

5434672 but in many countries our rights are seen as sins attention needs to be brought to attacks on lesbians gays bisexuals and transgender people around the world and action needs to be taken the pride movement is an important part of the process
5434673 this is a creative inclusive way of promoting the rights of lesbians gays bisexuals and transgender people from across europe

5434685 you never seem to deprive your vast readership of their giggles
5434686 ask your question and the useless men will answer often in a humorous way
5434687 its the old assumption that if one is homosexual then he is also psychologically disturbed
5434688 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything
5434689 people would not be sending this quantity of product to australia without a realistic expectation that they stand to be able to move all of this product
5434690 so what youre looking at is a truly phenomenal demand in australia for these sorts of drugs in the modern era
5434691 as long as that demand exists it doesnt matter what interdiction does
5434692 police complicit in seven kilos of cocaine reaching the street
5434693 likely to seriously endanger the health or safety of any person
5434694 that dope is ok and when she wants to try it the go to her
5434695 if they are so wrong about the environment and such hypocrits about so many things they are probably wrong about dope too
5434696 they will never make pot legal because it makes people think and they cant risk that
5434697 pot makes people think they are thinking when in reality they are astounding only themselves
5434698 it is interseting that the drugs that are proscibed are drugs that tend to have mind altering qualities if you became addicted to a drug that caused hair loss
5434699 before 1969 there was no drug problem as another poster has already pointed out they only became a serious social problem during the 1970s and one which has been growing like a cancer ever since
5434700 cocaine habit is a doggone thing the worst darn thing ive ever seen hey hey honey take it away from me cause i love my wiskey and i love my gin but the way i love my coke is a crying sin hey hey honey take away from me
5434701 all that does is stop the black maket trade created by prohibition
5434702 there were always drugs on the waterfronts of our big cities with the huge increase in car ownership the drugs started to work outwards into the suburbs and then into country australia
5434703 are you ready to get of heroin yet we can help you how much are you using it can do yo a lot of harm you know heres your prescription see you next week
5434704 you will never eradicate violent crime either but that doesnt mean you decriminalise it
5434705 everyone who regularly drinks alcohol in moderation most people experience significant health benefits and there is a net social worth in its responsible consumption
5434706 all drugs should be legal but heavily taxed with the taxes paying for medical treatment of users
5434707 it troubles me a lot what we saw it was like they made a witch out of her hillary clinton some people you know we thought the salem witch trials were over but some people no matter what she said it was dont believe it shes really evil this is ive never seen anyone do that to a candidate
5434708 18 million cracks in this glass ceiling is your sense the glass ceiling is about to be ultimately broken
5434709 oh it will definitely be broken you know we broke one ceiling with the nomination of barack obama and as pat said there is residual sexism there is residual racism
5434710 this is one old cbs hand who cant wait till she starts couric for my money is the best live television interviewer period and as for a woman as the solo network anchor what took them so long

5434715 is it ok if i order another beer or will these people think im a lush
5434716 will my wife think these concert tickets are out of our budget
5434717 consumption of calories has gone up but that does not tell us why people are eating more
5434718 some have argued that obesity has been produced by cheaper food but if fatness is a response to greater purchasing power why do we routinely observe that rich people are thinner than poor people
5434719 its a bit cheeky to pin it on sociological influences theres more to it than that
5434720 if you are surrounded by people whether thats friends or within the family home who are overweight you are sharing the same environment where there is likely to be an abundance of the wrong kind of foods
5434721 become aware of what your elected officials are doing in your name
5434722 there was nothing available that i could relate to it was then that one of my friends told me about a struggling premium tent company that made some great bags that were selling very well in the local market
5434723 around 95 of all bag and accessories manufacturing comes from
5434724 we are proud of the fact that everything that goes into our bags are from the kenyan heritage and its people
5434725 we are a safari lifestyle brand and people expect the highest quality on our products this shouldnt be confused with luxury our customers are those with active lifestyles seeking lasting quality they love the outdoors care for the environment and appreciate authentic products
5434726 from my personal experience with production in the scotch whiskey industry

5434728 the problems that can ensue with breast implants could be wound separation that could lead to exposure of the implant infection scarring certainly pain and capsular contractions
5434729 part of the six years of training to become a certified plastic surgeon is to find out if the patient has realistic expectations
5434730 it certainly appears as if this woman has pushed the envelope on what is expectable i certainly would not perform any additional surgery on her
5434731 gary was the best left tackle i ever saw play the game
5434732 his strength and athleticism were exceptional he understood the game and was as tough as i have ever seen also
5434733 he practically played his last year one armed because of a bad shoulder he was a classic left tackle and very deserving of his election to the hall of fame
5434734 it was kind of a storybook ending there for me
5434735 of the scanners tested a squared by emsisoft performed significantly better than the others

5434753 well are you saying that race is playing a role in this because i mean if she was white would she be being described as angry
5434754 well i think if you examined 1992 they tried to say hillary clinton was too tough she was too commanding she was too domineering and thats what you have here and so theyre trying to frame her that way but its ridiculous there are no facts to substantiate that
5434755 i do think a lot of this is not because of race that you have people who are who are critics of strong women who represent first ladies who arent just a matter of standing up there and reading the typical script when she talks about policy this is a woman who is an executive for a hospital she can discuss health care why not let her talk about it
5434756 candy there have been some things that that michelle obama has said that have certainly raised peoples eyebrows raised a lot of criticism her comments about the first time she was really proud of being an american i mean that has been widely criticized
5434757 it has and in some ways that was the kicking off point because last summer michelle obama was seen as this huge asset to him and then she made that remark and it came to light ive never been for the first time in my adult life im proud of my country and boy that was sort of the beginning of people really going after her
5434758 some weak men on the conservative side who frankly dont like strong liberal women

5434764 i would never consider making cindy mccain a campaign issue and if i saw people doing that i would speak out against it and the fact that i havent seen that from john mccain i think is a deep disappointment

5434854 the companys new battery can recharge 80 of a batterys energy capacity in only one minute approximately 60 times faster than the typical lithium ion batteries in wide use today and combines this fast recharge time with performance boosting improvements in energy density toshiba will bring the new rechargeable battery to commercial products in 2006 initial applications will be in the automotive and industrial sectors where the slim small sized battery will deliver large amounts of energy while requiring only a minute to recharge
5434855 i think theres a difference between infrastructure and end user hardware fast charging doesnt necessarily require a whole new wiring system or new wires to be run on the poles or underground
5434856 if capacitors work in the car then you could build a garage or station based capacitor feed station that built up charge slowly and dumped it into the auto capacitor fast
5434857 even if it did take a new wiring system in a house or station i wouldnt consider it an infrastructure change because the delivery of the electricity would still be through existing wires you could hook up anywhere that existing wires run

5434926 im not quite sure what youre getting at insurance companies dont cover termite damage anyway and the borate treatment does not damage the timber or metal in the building sodium borate doesnt promote corossion so there isnt an increased risk of rust

5434986 will tesla be making any formal statement regarding the presumed ev extended range concept ie gms volt as a possible design concept competitor to the pure ev battery approach

5434996 what the halibut have gm amp ford and general benefactor been doing with the hundreds of billions of dollars in profits over the years
5434997 california global warming solutions act of 2006 that passed recently plans to go through something like 75 billion dollars with major changes in energy generation and use all the details arent spelled out yet but it could mean things like mandatory solar panels on new construction
5434998 when you move on from the roadster id imagine there will be a trade off of power for range while it would be nice for my tesla road trip vehicle to go from 0 60 in 4 seconds i think people could live with 6 seconds if it made the difference between 250 miles on a charge and 500 600 miles on a charge
5434999 i knew that he was either a wacko or a mighty clever guy with a keen sense of humor
5435000 there is also the questions of the drive train why to use a transmission when there are e motors out there which could be attached straight to the wheels and make a real four wheel drive if i remember right mitsubishi is developing such a family car these type of induction motors act like an infinitive transmission brake and generator then there is raser tech at www rasertech com who claims that they have a 500 hp e motor which weighs only 60 pounds and is 50 more efficient than conventional e motors i am not an engineer and cant tell if this is real or con stuff
5435001 i was all intrigued by the idea of wheel motors what could be simpler mount a motor right in the wheels presto no differential no drive shafts no cv joints instant traction control and stability control what kills the idea of wheel motors for road cars is unsprung weight unsprung weight is the weight of the car that is below the springs tires wheels brakes hubs etc the higher the ratio of unsprung to sprung weight the worse the car handles unevenness on the road tracking the road is so important that even inexpensive cars now commonly are sold with aluminum alloy wheels alloy suspension components etc that knock a few pounds of unsprung weight off each corner of the car adding 30 unsprung pounds to each corner would mean abysmal handling
5435002 no differential no drive shafts no cv joints instant traction control and stability control

5435004 pro a plug in would allow you to take a long trip without waiting for an electric charge it simply operates as a gasoline car albeit with a heavy load of batteries onboard once the electric range is exceeded
5435005 one thing that im very curious about that i rarely see talked about is the cost of using carbon fiber and similarly advanced lightweight replacements for steel for as much of the car as possible
5435006 wool also plans to develop carbon fiber from the chicken feathers heating the feather fiber under nitrogen makes the material 20 times stiffer and 80 percent smaller which creates more rigid composites that are still hollow and light such a material would be particularly well suited for automotive applications and even the manufacture of tennis rackets and golf clubs

5435015 how do i charge my car in case of a blackout
5435016 range depends on driving style and conditions on the epa highway driving cycle we expect 250 miles on a charge
5435017 it isnt totally clear if the calendar extension will apply to zevs as well because the law seems written specifically for hybrids
5435018 i have to ask just what does 250 miles per charge mean when your sitting in a traffic jam with the ac running stereo blasting and its night with the lights on

5435022 theres a huge force for negativity in this world but im going to do my best to hold it down for as long as i can
5435023 working in partnership with our customer synergy innovations we set out to demonstrate what our electric wheel technology is capable of we simply took a standard bmw mini one discarded the engine the disc brakes the wheels and the gearbox these components were replaced by four of our electric wheels a lithium polymer battery a large ultra capacitor a very small ice with generator so small it almost fits alongside the spare wheel an energy management system and a sexy in car display module
5435024 all braking is performed by the wheel motors acting as very efficient electrical generators which return almost all of the energy back to the battery system because the wheels are high performance motors abs comes as a standard function built into each wheels software
5435025 the small ice weighs a mere 15kg less than 1 10th of the original mini one engine and delivers peak power of 20kw and continuous power of 15kw a high efficiency electrical generator is fitted to the engine to provide power when the battery depletion level demands the key point is that the engine is run at a continuous speed and load which results in optimum efficiency fuel conversion after delivering the energy to the battery system the mileage equivalent translates to between 65 and 80mpg
5435026 tesla we beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
5435027 you can get any color you want as long as its black
5435028 in the end i guess plug in hybrids are okay as a stop gap measure for people who really want one car that is a daily driver and also a road trip car but it seems so much more practical to use a purely electric car for the 99 of our driving that is less than 250 miles per day and just take our other car or rent a car for the occasional road trip that way we dont lug around a whole gasoline drivetrain every single day just to be ready for the rare long distance trek
5435029 a plug in hybrid with a small battery pack is much more abusive to the batteries than a pure electric car is this seems counter intuitive so bear with me lets say your particular battery design is good for 500 full charge discharge cycles on a pure electric car that goes 250 miles per charge the battery pack should last 500 x 250 125 000 miles on the other hand a hybrid with say a 50 miles range will cause the capacity of the batteries to drop much sooner 500 x 50 25 000 miles
5435030 of course you could put a full tesla roadster sized battery pack into a plug in hybrid but then the car is even more expensive a full electric drive train plus a full gasoline engine
5435031 any hybrid is still subject to the complexity of gasoline engine maintenance oil changes smog checks tune ups etc

5435180 during the years of its development our technology has been validated by various independent scientists and engineers
5435181 we are under no illusions that there will be a lot of cynicism out there about our proposition as it currently challenges one of the basic principles of physics however the implications of our technology go far beyond scientific curiosity addressing many urgent global needs including security of energy supply and zero emission energy production in order for these benefits to be achieved we need the public validation and endorsement of the scientific community
5435182 were playing our part in making that happen by throwing down the gauntlet with todays announcement now its over to the scientists to ensure that the real potential and benefits of our technology can be realised
5435183 but and thats a very big but lithium life is very sensitive to the average voltage the battery is kept and to the maximum voltage the battery is charged and unfortunately the degradation at high voltage is calendar based rather than cycling based so its very difficult to accelerate the data the main component that drives the degradation is just time and voltage and temperature
5435184 however natural gas accounts for only 14 9 20 of u s electricity generation the rest is a mix of coal nuclear and others the average well to outlet efficiency of u s electric generation including all the old inefficient power plants is about 41 21 with this efficiency our electric car has a well to wheel energy efficiency of 0 83 km mj still the most efficient car on the road

5435195 if we sold 2 000 cars in our second year that would be a huge success for us
5435196 for the big companies that would be a dismal failure
5435197 if the cheque was big enough and meant a real commitment from them to build the company then i think thats a good thing
5435198 big fast and efficient dont think corolla think bmw i love to drive and i think cars have been a great source of freedom for people so i thought what if we could make a car that is nice to drive it looks nice and would be very efficient lets take the philosophy that well make the best possible car we can

5435229 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
5435230 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
5435231 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
5435232 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back

5435255 over the last 40 years aviation has reduced fuel burn and therefore carbon dioxide emissions by 70 percent but more needs to be done
5435256 millions of barrels of kerosene are used each day for aircraft fuel and worldwide demand is growing
5435257 this has the potential to benefit every world citizen beyond those involved in our business
5435258 each of our companies has the social responsibility to work toward developing a cleaner way to do business
5435259 the national institute for health and clinical excellence nice guidelines for treating panic attacks are obviously not always being followed
5435260 a amp e is often the first port of call for a panic attack sufferer as they sometimes feel they cant breathe or are having a heart attack we know that a amp e departments are very busy and under resourced but it is essential that staff get it right because the standard of care and advice offered in accident and emergency can impact on the severity and duration of future attacks
5435261 the national phobics society has found that the focus in a amp e departments is very much on physical health and often there is a lack of professional skills in dealing with mental health issues it is inappropriate for a panic attack sufferer to wait for long periods of time in a crowded waiting room only to then be sent home without treatment or advice and this is an all too common occurrence
5435262 many obese people have major social and psychological issues that doctors and public health policies often do not address

5435264 jan narveson the only important contemporary hedonist of whom i am aware
5435265 epicurus gave comfort to many by arguing that death was nothing to fear pain being the only evil and dead people suffering not at all it is fairly plain i think that death can be understood as evil only if it is understood to mean extinction though even if there is some kind of personal existence after death we nevertheless cease to exist as individual human beings in the world and that heaven knows is terrifying enough ceasing to be is what most of us with or without reason fear more than anything
5435266 if so it looks as though things can be bad for you because of the deprivation of good things as well as the presence of bad things that in turn seems to imply that death can be a bad thing even though non existence doesnt involve any positively bad effects on oneself
5435267 since negative experiences are i would guess at least as likely as positive ones
5435268 why are we talking about this in the white house
5435269 according to a former cia official involved in the process
5435270 cia headquarters would receive cables from operatives in the field asking for authorization for specific techniques
5435271 the high level discussions about these enhanced interrogation techniques were so detailed bush administration sources said some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed down to the number of times cia agents could use a specific tactic these top advisers signed off on how the cia would interrogate top al qaeda suspects whether they would be slapped pushed deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning called waterboarding sources told abc news

5435300 we need a policy and strategy that starts with leadership what is the mission not just for nasa what is the u s space mission and how does that drive innovation and how does that get young people excited we are graduating fewer and fewer engineers they are increasing the number of engineers in china and other countries i think this is a multifaceted problem and it is going to take national leadership to move this ball forward off a partisan discussion or just a budget discussion its going to take leadership

5435321 no one yet knows how to do this in a way that makes sense in the long term however there are some very large companies working on this so i am confident that we will be there
5435322 we add solar energy and through the miracle of photosynthesis we get hydrocarbons
5435323 these hydrocarbons can be separated into products for industry such as fertilizer that contains nitrogen that is fixed in the process or methane that can be used to make just about any chemical or plastic
5435324 these units will cover about a half acre and will consume about 100 tons of carbon dioxide per year
5435325 the animals and algae synergistically work with each other in a multiorganism community that is sustainable
5435326 people talk about the price of carbon as if it something we have to have hauled away
5435327 carbon dioxide is not a waste product it is something you can reprocess into something that has 200 worth of value

5435340 every discussion between the current government parties for example is labeled as an argument
5435341 it will become difficult to present new political ideas one aims to change a crisis situation by changing the rule of the game
5435342 a majority based electoral system would do little to democratize the parties

5435351 all we can do is make the players confident about the measures taken in regard to safety and security and on that basis hope they participate
5435352 that is the reason we are putting together a task team inviting all the main stakeholders including fica international players association so the process is inclusive
5435353 hes reassured me that the ecb have got an emergency meeting on 4 august and theyll be making a decision there
5435354 its a very fluid situation in pakistan at the moment its primarily the external environment were looking at and which we have raised some concerns over we will be monitoring that very closely
5435355 were in very close touch with the pca professional cricketers association
5435356 clearly other boards around the world are in the same position the safety and security of our players is paramount and we wont compromise on that
5435357 from the players point of view we do have major concerns with security in pakistan
5435358 a lot has happened in pakistan from a security point of view since we were there and those are things that are worrying us
5435359 generally thats a full player view i dont know any players who dont have issues with regards to security in pakistan
5435360 there were bombings taking place in karachi and bombings are taking place in lahore now
5435361 within three days of us returning home there was a state of emergency so we have seen how quickly things can develop
5435362 the risks are too great for us to recommend our players go there
5435363 we would expect cricket australia to adopt the same position
5435364 it is only a game of cricket at the end of the day and putting yourself in a position where youre not safe is ridiculous
5435365 we believe this is a poor icc decision we cant see how they have put player safety as their number one priority and this is very disappointing
5435366 our recommendation to our players is not to travel to pakistan at this point in time
5435367 there isnt one player i have spoken to who is comfortable about travelling to pakistan at the moment
5435368 weve still got some very serious concerns despite the fact that the pakistan cricket board have made every effort they can to try to make it as safe as possible
5435369 but unfortunately in that part of the world there are some matters that are beyond anyones control
5435370 i think one thing that the england and wales cricket board has said and something we are very well aligned on is the one thing you are never going to compromise on is security

5435382 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain
5435383 shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start

5435385 tyra kept saying when i was a model and would hardly let them talk
5435386 she had the audience prance down the street and then release black balloons some were whining that it was so bad for the environment

5435388 i would have never known they hid it so well
5435389 are you going to stop her you can always tell your mother she would change her mind
5435390 she swore me to secrecy and if my mother tells my father finn would definitely be removed from the palace and perhaps the kingdom as well she would never forgive me for that
5435391 i suppose it would depend on the man if he wasnt of royal blood or nobility i would have to choose my next step wisely
5435392 i would not absolutely forbid it but i also wouldnt let her be joined with an uneducated peasant finn has worked hard his whole life to be where he is today your father should take that into consideration
5435393 urlachen please dont take offense at what i am about to say about your father when i am king i will govern the way my father does with fairness your father rules with an iron fist and i am surprised the nobles are putting up with it lord macnamara told my father that the taxes are so high in his region that he has a hard time collecting from the peasants most of them are just farmers and your father demands much of their crops as well peasants are people too they deserve to live each day not worrying if they are going to be able to feed their children the next day no i am going to do things the right way the way god would expect me to

5435407 when you stood at mount sinai god asked who will insure that you will always fear god you should have replied almighty you will you should have seized the opportunity to request that god give you fear of heaven
5435408 it is proper for all those who fear god to constantly be in pain and worry over the destruction of the holy temple
5435409 any generation in which the holy temple is not rebuilt is held responsible for its destruction

5435479 making sure that information remains accessible despite the rapid pace of changes in technology is a significant issue for all government departments
5435480 there is a real danger of losing critical knowledge vital for today s government business effective digital preservation is essential to ensure government s accountability business continuity and efficiency
5435481 the workhouse and its records tell the story of the building the paupers and staff who lived there and wider issues with real contemporary relevance this material which is now available to the public for the first time is uniquely placed to help visitors and researchers discover how important history is to them today this project has only been possible due to the hard work of our volunteers who have found the experience very empowering and have ensured that the hidden history of the poor is now accessible to all
5435482 we got caught up in the moment of filming and we made a mistake and forgot to buckle our seatbelts
5435483 mrs clinton was looking like everyones first wife standing outside a probate court
5435484 the ephemeral nature of digital information resulting from the rapid evolution of technology is a major challenge facing government and our society today unless we take action we face the certainty of losing years of critical knowledge that s why it is essential that the national archives together with the it industry address the challenge now our relationship with microsoft supports our work in digital preservation and gives us many key tools to access the legacy of government for years to come
5435485 microsoft took the step to implement xml based file formats that unlock data in documents allowing them to be archived restructured aggregated and re used in new and dynamic ways as a result the latest releases of office use open standard file formats open xml our m o u with the national archives will go beyond this and ensure that decisions we make in future products will meet the rigorous requirements of digital preservation more importantly ensure that future generations do not suffer the fate of a digital dark age
5435486 things of the heart such as love faith courage happiness loyalty honor and reverence cannot be measured and quantified scientifically
5435487 things of the heart cannot be measured and quantified scientifically and therefore embody truth that cannot be understood by the logical reasoning mind alone
5435488 things of the heart can only be known by the heart
5435489 those who only trust the truth of the mind are therefore stunted and handicapped in their ability to comprehend all truth i feel great sorrow for those poor souls who walk in the darkness caused by understanding the truth only through the filter of logic and reason
5435490 i feel sorry for the poor fools who think and believe differently than i do
5435491 but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart
5435492 died in their sins without a knowledge of the truth or in transgression having rejected the prophets
5435493 no forgiveness in this world nor in the world to come having denied the holy spirit after having received it and having denied the only begotten son of the father having crucified him unto themselves and put him to an open shame
5435494 the sin against the holy ghost requires such knowledge that it is manifestly impossible for the rank and file to commit such a sin
5435495 have the heavens opened unto him and know god he has got to say that the sun does not shine while he sees it he has got to deny jesus christ when the heavens have been opened unto him and to deny the plan of salvation with his eyes open to the truth of it
5435496 we certainly dont believe in the sectarian christian notion of hell as a place of eternal suffering where everyone goes except for saved evangelical christians how could anyone affirming a loving god believe in such a place the closest that mormon doctrine comes to that concept is spirit prison detention but not suffering for the unrepentant after death but prior to the resurrection and perdition a place of eternal suffering reserved for a very few souls who come out in rebellion against god after having full knowledge of his goodness and glory but those really arent that much like the traditional christian notion of hell
5435497 do you really want this condition for eternity or at least until the end of the millennium if not repent
5435498 the worst thing god can do is absolutely nothing which he does by totally withdrawing from you
5435499 no one has ever been damned as a result of obedience to law
5435500 if you had lived in the days of moses and you had a question about a matter of religion such as whether a baptism should be performed by immersion or by sprinkling why would you have gone to moses for an answer to your question instead of some other religious teacher
5435501 is known as a hiss and a byword the world over and in the church in particular
5435502 some of the high priests in this church are ignorant of basic doctrine
5435503 this is from true to the faith the correlated book published by the church of jesus christ of latter day saints and copyrighted in 2004 by intellectual reserve inc and introduced by the first presidency this book is distributed by the priesthood to new members at or shortly after their baptism and the doctrine in it is as pure and undefiled as anything in the book of mormon or the doctrine and covenants
5435504 god has appointed a day in which he will judge the world and this he has given an assurance of in the he raised up his son jesus christ from the dead the point on which the hope of all who believe the inspired record is founded for their future happiness and enjoyment
5435505 for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself
5435506 and the lord said whom shall i send and one answered like unto the son of man here am i send me and another answered and said here am i send me and the lord said i will send the first
5435507 he wasnt president of the church when he wrote it
5435508 before he died he regretted ever having written that book
5435509 the guilty taketh the truth to be hard for it cutteth them to the very center
5435510 it is because there are people who do not like to repent of their sins
5435511 we would admonish all of you to read and reread president spencer w kimballs book the miracle of forgiveness the sooner you can read it the greater blessing it will be for you
5435512 sometimes i think i might have been a little too strong about some of the things i wrote in this book
5435513 the book filled a need as evidenced by the printing of half a million copies in english and sixteen other languages between its publication in 1969 and his death in 1985 by 1998 the total in all languages was roughly estimated at 1 6 million copies
5435514 im glad i didnt read it in my sexually active youth or i wouldnt have served a mission and likely wouldnt be lds today
5435515 from family planning to masturbation to sex beyond vaginal intercourse to causes of homosexuality theres a lot of stuff weve moved on from and makes people cringe today
5435516 perhaps the mof contributes to the high suicide rate amoung lds youth
5435517 but to be fair to swk we still have apostles today claiming special knowledge on a subjects they dont really seem to grasp theyre people like us
5435518 what i the lord have spoken i have spoken and i excuse not myself and though the heavens and the earth pass away my word shall not pass away but shall all be fulfilled whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same
5435519 theres really no foundation for claims such as the one that masturbation leads to homosexuality
5435520 for when they are learned they think they are wise and they hearken not unto the counsel of god for they set it aside supposing they know of themselves wherefore their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not
5435521 also far reaching is the effect of the loss of chastity once given or taken or stolen it can never be regained even in a forced contact such as rape or incest the injured one is greatly outraged if she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed she is of course in a more favorable position there is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation it is better to die in defending ones virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle
5435522 if any man will do his will the fathers will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself jesus christ
5435523 this new format has come at a time of heightened awareness about the access to digital documents any format that can assist archives and libraries to do this is welcome

5435525 the nuclear weapons question runs through recent british history like an irradiated thread given the high level of technical secrecy and political sensitivity in which the bomb was embedded it represents a fascinating hidden history of 20th century britain there is a strong element of now it can be told in this book
5435526 local archives are key to preserving our nation s heritage and the services they provide are invaluable both generally and in the communities they serve the local authority archive survey is a great step forward enabling archives to show local authorities where they are doing well how they compare to other services and the areas in need of improvement indeed the results show that despite the quality of effort there is a lot of work to be done to ensure our heritage is adequately cared for
5435527 i am thrilled that the national archives has won this award the digital revolution has drastically changed the nature of the information we need to safeguard and digital preservation is now fundamental to preserving our heritage the national archives seeks to ensure the survival of today s information for tomorrow constantly developing new tools to ensure that we continue to have access to the information government creates
5435528 is designed to help companies struggling to understand how to deploy the plethora of integration technologies now available

5435531 a long term architectural approach to enabling the mainframe to participate in newer applications for the future
5435532 meant for businesspeople theyre for business solutions where you care about the end to end view looking at the whole thing
5435533 to rationalize the presentation of the different services to various types of mobile devices there are additional requirements for mobile integration that layer on top of other integration infrastructure services
5435534 the underlying technologies that will enable the integration infrastructure of the future you can build upon them there are many benefits to looking at this from an enterprise point of view and building an integration architecture
5435535 you dont want to for example have portals with different integration technology than your b2b integration
5435536 you want to reduce the need to integrate integration technologies
5435537 just one more reason for taking the enterprise approach to building an integration infrastructure is it enables you to look at patterns and understand the overlap among them to help you avoid costly mistakes by doing it right the first time
5435538 you want to architect things to work together from the get go
5435539 because then youll know you can manage it over time

5435561 you might be able to infer that they both enhance uv exposure
5435562 to have theories about how diseases are caused or influenced but we have to see evidence there should be an effort made to do large population based studies
5435563 if you think im going to hell unless i believe like you do you must think you are good and the rest of us are bad after all bad people go to hell and good people go to heaven
5435564 would like to announce as a practicing believing jew that i am in no way offended let alone frightened by evangelical christians who believe that it is necessary to have faith in jesus in order to be saved
5435565 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
5435566 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing 1 them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age
5435567 for we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard
5435568 being born into a christian home doesnt make someone a christian any more than being born in a bakery makes them a bagel
5435569 many of my jewish brethren reject evangelical christians as dogmatic and intolerant in so doing they are guilty themselves of rejecting one of judaisms most seminal teachings to judge a man by his actions rather than his beliefs just try and find kinder more compassionate people who are more willing to assist their fellow man in a time of crisis than the evangelicals and this is especially true of the evangelical love for israel
5435570 lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world
5435571 it seems to me that a lot of jews who feel threatened by proselytizers are really unsure of their own identity and beliefs their own essential jewishness i dont think jews need to become christians or even republicans they we simply have to stop being so hostile superior or harsh to people who are extending a hand of friendship
5435572 more than any other force in the world today the extreme christian right is the immediate and profound threat to our republic
5435573 theyve never given up trying to bring me to jesus thats what evangelicals do its in their spiritual dna and im ok with that
5435574 lapin reassures jews that despite evangelicals having been some of the most persistent anti semites in the past they are the jews natural allies
5435575 while many evangelical christians are strong supporters of israel they present a dilemma for the jewish community evangelicals are the only christian grouping in the u s who today vigorously and clearly assert that without christ there cannot be any salvation redemption or cleansing from sin and actively work to convert anyone including jews
5435576 for i tell you you will not see me again until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord
5435577 and so all israel will be saved as it is written the deliverer will come from zion he will turn godlessness away from jacob
5435578 jews have such a cynical negative view of these people there are all sorts of crazy conspiracy theories out there about how evangelicals only support israel to bring on armageddon or because they want to convert the jews to christianity thats not true theyre not religious fanatics and they dont have ulterior motives these are good religious people who love israel and want to help whats the matter with that
5435579 studying pain in children offers us insights into how the brain may cure itself because the young brain is so adaptable relative to the adult brain
5435580 this may offer very important insights into the development of new therapeutic approaches to chronic pain a condition that more than 50 million americans suffer from with relatively little in terms of highly effective therapies
5435581 this is a significant pain problem that often leaves individuals incapacitated wheel chair bound and limited in their physical abilities
5435582 it can be difficult to diagnose and without proper treatment children and adults living with cprs live in absolute agony
5435583 crps is a frightening illness because it can develop as a result of a seemingly trivial injury
5435584 for example a 14 year old girl can sprain an ankle during a basketball game but what seems like a common and easily treatable injury can develop in to crps causing extreme pain throughout her body
5435585 the central nervous system imaging of pain in pediatric patients is a nascent development within the increasingly productive field of functional mri fmri
5435586 this non invasive technique provides a unique window into regions of the brain actively engaged in pain transmission and modulation contrast to adult pediatric patients are still developing these regions along with their connections and may show fmri patterns of activation in response to pain that differ from adults additionally children often recover symptomatically from painful disorders such as crps
5435587 we will continue to study pediatric patients with crps and with other painful disorders such as headache to begin to define the pediatric cns circuitry of acute and chronic pain
5435588 such information may eventually allow current and novel therapeutic interventions to target the cns processes ultimately responsible for the complex sensory and emotional experience of pediatric pain
5435589 our team took advantage of the opportunity to look at children in the pain state and the non pain state
5435590 we were trying to define what happens to a changing brain as it adapts over time in those afflicted with this syndrome
5435591 this paper is not just a first for kids but also has implications for understanding the adult condition
5435592 the brain changes seen during the pain state don t disappear during the early non pain state as a result subsequent injuries could rekindle the condition or other problems could occur later
5435593 our results suggest significant changes in cns circuitry in pediatric patients with crps may outlast the signs and symptoms
5435594 it brings new research to understanding acute and chronic pain disorders in childhood
5435595 furthermore it integrates programs that are already at the forefront of pediatric pain treatment such as the newly established mayo pediatric pain rehabilitation program at childrens with modern neuroimaging facilities recently established at childrens waltham
5435596 business process management is becoming so important in organizations that its like the word snow for eskimos we have many acronyms now and its important to understand that theyre not all the same thing
5435597 the underlying application performs the base functions but the flow of control across components and applications in the end to end process represents the way the way the business is conducted
5435598 how far have i come in my long term goals
5435599 the wise mans eyes are in front of his head
5435600 if you catch me biting my nails then ill pay you 50
5435601 two are better than one when one falls the second picks him up
5435602 its a smile its a kiss its a sip of wine its the summer time
5435603 the proceeds we receive from the sale of each series of notes will be designated by the lender members who purchased the notes of that series to fund an unsecured consumer loan
5435604 it is absolutely wrong to force any student to share the same bathrooms and showers with homosexual teachers or students
5435605 i dont really have an answer for it but were going to have to do something if theres going to be a considerable number of our people who are going to go that way homosexual
5435606 hit the victim about his face with a closed fist causing the victim to fall to the ground
5435607 city council candidate brian boyer local man engage in fisticuffs
5435608 only one country in the middle east is known to actually possess nuclear warheads the state of israel which begs the question if the united states was able to persuade this body that saddam hussein was a threat worthy of international action how can we allow a double standard for israel
5435609 its very important to have your finger on the pulse to manage the business in real time for competitive advantage
5435610 the real time enterprise is not a single technology its actually a business model focused on delivering business information on demand anytime anywhere and focused on accelerating business processes the problem with business processes today is that they cross multiple systems organizational units and even organizations
5435611 the regulatory environment has never been more intrusive and active management of those processes is a necessity
5435612 produce certification not just of the results that the business has produced but also of the processes that produced those results
5435613 you cant manage and improve what you cant see its important to understand what the status of the process is before you can improve it you cant wait for end of the month reports or end of the quarter reports you need it now
5435614 in most organizations we turn to we find there are business processes that are being performed every day but theyre often not defined and frequently not understood
5435615 allows business management the chance to see real exceptions and take action
5435616 be so rigid that different groups or organizations cant adopt uniqueness that are more appropriate to their businesses
5435617 in fact a lot of the processes and models can have very robust decision rules that allow you to follow multiple paths and have each of the process models included so that the business areas can be as unique as they need to be in order to satisfy customers
5435618 you can still maintain your current systems of record but you can reuse the business logic and data in new applications and system flows and make all of them work together in a much more holistic way
5435619 in this world where business applications are changing every day and where people are adding and divesting themselves of departments and divisions the ability to do this automation and change processes very flexibly is a critical requirement
5435620 you can wrapper services applications as a web service and enable different functions as services that can be tied together as business processes and enable composite application development
5435621 in order for an soa to work you really need two things
5435622 one is the ability to enable and expose existing assets be it logic business data stores etc if they cant participate in those services and cant participate in the business you really have only half of the solution
5435623 the second thing thats required is some sort of a bus and enterprise wide transport capability that allows you put messages on the bus and off of the bus and go to the services that have been available that have been exposed
5435624 the key to life is that organizations need to follow these standards so you have the ability to export them so you dont lose the investment you made in them in the first place
5435625 most people resist change just as a matter of fact
5435626 put myself out there more let people get to know me
5435627 as it appears that sexism and misogyny are now going to be blamed for hillarys failure will media be as honest about the causes and the sources as cocco
5435628 the national archives aim is to make the information we hold across all of our websites and catalogues even more accessible helping to bring history to life for everyone the introduction of tna global search means that users worldwide are now able to quickly and easily search through our vast catalogue of records to locate relevant information we are delighted that tna global search has been recognised for its achievements in improving user experience

5435630 being on who do you think you are affected me and my close friends in a very positive way i hope that setting out to discover your own family story will affect you positively too but black people s history can be positive and negative in all sorts of different ways before you start tracing your family you need to be assured in your own mind that you re willing to accept whatever you find out about your past
5435631 caribbean family history day is a fantastic event that the national archives is proud to support archives are relevant to every culture and can tell fascinating stories to members of all generations we hope that by engaging young people in family history it will encourage them to explore the treasure trove of resources available as well as discovering more about their own identities
5435632 our work with the national archives has been a great partnership in encouraging more people from the african caribbean community to trace their family trees and explore their history the prime minister s recent statement expressing regret for britain s involvement in the slave trade provides a new opportunity for caribbean family history to be taken more seriously and families in britain who have a connection with the slave trade should now be encouraged to share information this should provide positive help and assistance to black communities in tracing their family trees to the caribbean and to africa
5435633 these files give individuals a fascinating insight into the people who settled in london over the past 100 years
5435634 by putting the surviving cards online the national archives hopes that the information will be a valuable source for people investigating their personal family history as well as for individuals interested in immigration trends social and political history

5435639 zing hahahaha lets not even get started on womans day or womens weekly not doubt also the product of an old boys club of male execs out of touch with women
5435640 feminist foremothers have worked hard to improve opportunity for women today 60 of mums are in the workforce either full or part time equality is the new feminist mantra
5435641 maybe if we took all the marketers salesman lawyers middle managers and looney religious zealots etc put them on a boat and sent them to an island damn we did that and ended up with the us
5435642 a disparity between the size of female spending and the male monopoly of power
5435643 poor poor me i had to do some housework today must apply for stress leave
5435644 i was just wondering what unleashed is doing offering this self promotion spot masquerading as opinion to a female owned advertising agency
5435645 there are around 51 of humans that are female but no where near that proportion of national leaders are female just take a look at photos of the commonwealth heads of government meetings for example helen clark nz stands out like a proverbial sore thumb amongst the boys club
5435646 bec having represented the what women want aus party at the last election i know the answers to all of your questions
5435647 women might be making 85 of all consumer goods purchases
5435648 go forth from your country to the land which i will show you 2 and i will make you a great nation and i will bless you and make your name great and so you shall be a blessing 3 and i will bless those who bless you and the one who curses you i will curse and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed
5435649 you yourselves have seen what i did to the egyptians and how i bore you on eagles wings and brought you to myself 5 now then if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant then you shall be my own possession among all the peoples for all the earth is mine 6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words that you shall speak to the sons of israel
5435650 now therefore thus you shall say to my servant david thus says the lord of hosts
5435651 i have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you and i will make you a great name like the names of the great men who are on the earth
5435652 i will also appoint a place for my people israel and will plant them that they may live in their own place and not be disturbed again nor will the wicked afflict them any more as formerly
5435653 when your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers i will raise up your descendant after you who will come forth from you and i will establish his kingdom
5435654 he shall build a house for my name and i will establish the throne of his kingdom forever
5435655 i will be a father to him and he will be a son to me when he commits iniquity i will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men
5435656 your house and your kingdom shall endure before me forever your throne shall be established forever
5435657 when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah 32 not like the covenant which i made with their fathers in the day i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt my covenant which they broke although i was a husband to them
5435658 but this is the covenant which i will make with the house of israel after those days
5435659 i will put my law within them and on their heart i will write it and i will be their god and they shall be my people
5435660 they will not teach again each man his neighbor and each man his brother saying know the lord for they will all know me from the least of them to the greatest of them
5435661 for i will forgive their iniquity and their sin i will remember no more
5435662 it says in the writings of jeremiah rabbi that the days come saith the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah
5435663 rabbi i try to keep the law i try to be a good husband and father and neighbor but i know i fall short of what the almighty expects how can i ever attain a level of holiness where gods law is in my inward parts im a sinful man
5435664 this is a worthy question mottel on shabbos i will bring a drasha on this very subject
5435665 where the hell am i getting this load of spam on my forum
5435666 the proceeds we receive from the sale of each series of notes will be designated by the lender members who purchased the notes of that series to fund an unsecured consumer loan
5435667 always puts a smile on my face with their silly and hilarious answers
5435668 the more that people in this world learn about each other and the world they live in the greater the likelihood well someday learn to get along

5435671 there are useless men all over the place but how many admit to their general uselessness in their own blog
5435672 its amazing or is that scary how much sense they make
5435673 a great site to laugh with and get something out of it its called uselessmen
5435674 so not stupid it should be enshrined if it had a better template
5435675 so what if their advice is useless its absolutely hilarious
5435676 cancel my subscription to esquire and tell the answer fella to blow it out of his retentive bung hole
5435677 what other kind of advice is there from a man
5435678 you never seem to deprive your vast readership of their giggles
5435679 ask your question and the useless men will answer often in a humorous way
5435680 considering the current debate about agricultural land being used to produce biofuels algae may well be a significant future alternative fuel source as we set about tackling climate change
5435681 while most other biodiesels come from agricultural crops like canola soy and palm oil algae can be grown with ease in ponds or tanks on poor quality land
5435682 the first stage will be the identification and development of suitable algae strains to achieve stable continuous high yield algae production
5435683 next year we plan to build a 35 000 tonne algae pilot farm followed by a 400 hectare algae farm by 2010 which can ultimately consume in excess of 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and provide algae oil for a 250 000 tonne biodiesel plant
5435684 algae require large volumes of carbon dioxide to grow which means less carbon dioxide is release into the atmosphere so it will make sense in future to situate such farms near major industry and power station
5435685 companies that do produce carbon dioxide will eventually be able to claim carbon credits as the carbon dioxide can be stored or captured and released into algae farms
5435686 ive been following your stuff for a while now and have largely improved what i have in my current day job
5435687 what were talking about is something that is radically different
5435688 one thing that is encouraging is the level of attention and the investment thats happening to really try to find better ways to fuel our transportation system
5435689 changing to this green crude could certainly have very good benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions but it may not address some of the traditional tailpipe pollutants that are responsible for smog or ozone
5435690 the emissions reductions may be coming from the refining process but we would still have emissions issues in and from the vehicle
5435691 we wish them luck and look forward to their technical studies that demonstrate the cost and feasibility of their production processes
5435692 our expectation is that there will not be those kinds of emissions
5435693 we want to displace the existing petroleum system with a continuous production system that is essentially an oil field on top of the ground that produces oil on a continuous basis for as long as you want it to
5435694 you wake up in the middle of the night thinking about the implications of this
5435695 without giving away too much i can say that the second model will be a sporty four door family car at roughly half the 89k price point of the tesla roadster and the third model will be even more affordable in keeping with a fast growing technology company all free cash flow is plowed back into r amp d to drive down the costs and bring the follow on products to market as fast as possible when someone buys the tesla roadster sports car they are actually helping pay for development of the low cost family car
5435696 do we really have 4 5 years to play around with a roadster that is affordable only to the very very few it is imperative that tesla or another company develop an affordable mass produced 4 door sedan
5435697 the roadsters ac induction electric motor can rotate at up to 13 500 rpm
5435698 i we beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
5435699 you can have a car in any color you want as long as it is black
5435700 make the money first and then we will make changes that will alter the way things are done
5435701 ppmt is the biggest leap in motor and generator design logic in more than a hundred years
5435702 the 40k performance ev everyone is asking for just isnt feasible
5435703 why isnt tesla using the latest gee whiz awesome just invented super technology
5435704 draft gore 2008 that would be a nice option to go with the car
5435705 normally a true ac induction motor is does not operate as a variable speed motor and is normally started at a min load condition when coming up to its designed speed due to the surge of power it uses this is my concern
5435706 they will make a marginal profit selling this car at 85 100k im not sure they would if they sold a less impressive car for 50k
5435707 if they want to change the way the world thinks about energy use and transportation the profit margin would not be driving their investment
5435708 i have a hard time imagining a sports car pulling a trailer but i can imagine just about any other kind of car pulling one
5435709 normally a true ac induction motor is does not operate as a variable speed motor and is normally started at a min load condition when coming up to its designed speed due to the surge of power it uses this is my concern
5435710 id like to be able to invest in the company
5435711 if tesla engineering isnt around to troubleshoot and repair problems i think it is unlikely that there will be very many other people able to work on these cars when they need it
5435712 though the tesla roadster is assembled in england it does not currently meet uk requirements either something about the steering wheel on the other side
5435713 there is indeed nothing magic about the 6 831 number it is in fact 99 in series by 69 in parallel 99 69 6831 these numbers were mainly a function of the electrical specs that we wanted to achieve 420vdc max and 600adc max they were also adjusted slightly to meet our packaging goals of 11 sub modules all the same the output per battery is about 8 5a under max acceleration 4c
5435714 by the way the elise is expected to be redesigned next year i wonder if it will look more or less like the tesla apparently lotus had gotten a temporary exception to bring the non compliant elise headlight design into the us and so they will definitely need to redo the front end from their current model
5435715 every time she goes in that ring there is always a worry she will start crying
5435716 my dream and his mums dream is for him to win a stadium title

5435721 once they come out and surrender their lives will be protected if that is not done then we could have a situation where those small groups become a source of insecurity
5435722 we have had 1 111 cases of cholera in our camp alone
5435723 if conditions do not improve soon it the mortality rate will most certainly go much higher
5435724 we made a mistake in the last 10 years when we abandoned somalia we accepted that somalia be stateless giving a leeway for outlaws to take charge of it this is what we are paying for today
5435725 i get the idea that its really pissed off a lot of women

5435736 the national archives is well known and highly regarded for the work we do in safeguarding and illustrating british history however doing this requires us to be a lot more than just a historical government archive we ve always played a key role in a paper world ensuring high standards of records and information management in government and ensuring that information survives to become tomorrow s permanent record the challenges of a digital world are even greater and so are the opportunities for government as well as the public if we succeed in managing this information effectively the benefits are not just for posterity they are also for today the national archives strengthened by its merger with opsi now has a more powerful policy advocacy and delivery remit across the information management spectrum
5435737 this merger is an exciting move for both the national archives and opsi bringing together a clear focus and alignment for government information policy creating a stronger organisation the strengthened and merged organisation will bring a centre of gravity and expertise to every strand of the information cycle we are marking out a shared vision that recognises a new integrated information management territory
5435738 i thoroughly enjoyed meeting fellow family historians and representatives from the wider genealogy community the day was a great success thanks to the commitment and imagination of all those who attended and i look forward to seeing many of the ideas generated realised in the development of family history services at kew in 2008
5435739 it is very important to the national archives that our users are actively involved with large operational decisions such as the relocation of our services from the family records centre to kew we are aware of the popularity of the islington site but we are also confident that by working with the family history community we can provide an even better service in kew by the end of 2008

5435758 hey this is freaking futile and is making conditions here a hell on earth were adopting a policy of complete non violence towards the israelis from now on only having weapons for our police force but we would really appreciate that all the support certain countries have been giving us only come in the form of investment and humanitarian aid from now on
5435759 yknow its a massive drain on our economy to use a big chunk of our military to act as prison guards for the palestinians were going to draw a line that will be our border and no more settler bullshit and military service will just be volunteer from now on were also scaling back our weapons production oh and can someone call the us and tell them and the lobbyists we dont need the whole foreign aid armaments thing anymore

5435784 this is a fantastic result the seed was so old and had been stored in some dubious conditions until its arrival at the national archives including a ship and the tower of london we really did not expect to get anything
5435785 this is an exciting discovery and a testament to the hard work that goes into preserving the files at the national archives to be able not only to discover these seeds but also to germinate them helps to bring history to life literally i will be keeping my eye on the seeds developments over the coming months and years

5435843 romania has so many problems terms of perception that it becomes difficult to make an inventory
5435844 the difference between romania and other countries is that its communist past and its experiences right after 1989 have been much more negative and visible in western media compared to the others
5435845 this picture is incomplete out of date and extremely difficult to change
5435846 their brand is still strongly tainted with negative imagery acquired under soviet influence
5435847 and the majority of foreign publics have not yet updated their perceptions the only reason why bulgaria and poland are doing better than romania is because they are better organised and are doing something about it
5435848 romania was a blank page after the revolution and this was what was first communicated
5435849 these things do not have the depth they used to have
5435850 when a person a group a nation does not build itself an image it is attributed one the first one at hand
5435851 many free citizens of europe are confused between budapest and bucharest and romania and bulgaria
5435852 we dont have an image or if we do it is a negative one created by foreigners experience with one or two romanian thieves
5435853 i dont think that when they hear romania foreigners suddenly think of something we have no awareness
5435854 in spite of the socio economic stresses there is hardly any violence if you compare romania to some of its neighbours
5435855 there are a lot of success stories of romanians in and outside romania but they are just not covered by the media its bizarre
5435856 during 50 years of communism we were not able to do anything against this highly organised and crushing regime
5435857 all we could do was make fun of ourselves let me give you an example
5435858 they dont think too much of themselves so they arent able to do good things together with their neighbours
5435859 because they start with the thought that the neighbour is going to cheat on them
5435860 we deceive ourselves that nadia comaneci meant something to the world and that everyone knows hagi
5435861 romanians are too optimistic and see romania as the most beautiful place in the world
5435862 we romanians were taught during primary school that we beat the turks
5435863 that we can repair a car with a piece of wire while the germans had to wait for a spare part to come from the factory
5435864 the problem is that we have to invent a country brand for a country which is not at all united
5435865 everybody drives fast gains fortunes fast and loses them just as fast
5435866 in this context before starting to project romania abroad we should start to find out what keeps us together except for the borders and except for the fact that we consider ourselves a fucked up nation
5435867 if we are going to build a brand we need to be honest about our country the way to build a brand is to gain credibility
5435868 who remembers nowadays that in the time of the visconti movie rocco and his brothers 1960 the italians were raging across europe from austria to germany and france searching for work while nowadays italy is the image of fine restaurants and the perfume of tomatoes

5435872 you know what stars are perchik theyre the lights in the sky
5435873 but what are they mama and how did they get up there and how high are they what else is up above besides god and if stars are lights why are they so different from candles candlelight is yellow starlight is white or blue if i put a candle way up in the sky would the light change colors
5435874 maybe the almighty threw the stars out there just in time for travelers to see where they were going
5435875 the night sky is just a big black blanket with holes poked in it so that we see glimpses of heavens glory or perhaps the sky is like a big mirror and what we call stars are really reflections of all the little villages across the earth even vaysechvoos
5435876 i wish to explain to you about the stars in the sky
5435877 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was waste and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also
5435878 praise ye the lord he telleth the number of the stars he calleth them all by their names great is our lord and of great power his understanding is infinite
5435879 if you want to know about a saddle my son you go and talk to the saddlemaker if you want to learn about trousers you go to hershel the tailor and if you want to know about the stars go ask the almighty he is the one who fashioned them and not only the stars the almighty made you too with all your curiosity and wonder so perchik ask your questions of the one who knows more about the stars and the moon and the sun and you i am convinced youll learn much

5435904 the continued public fascination with the movie is that it was made during a politically conservative time and for a movie about a feminine gay man and a socialist who learn to love and respect one another it seems to have been tailored in such a way that molinas gayness is like a straight guys imagination of what a girlish man should be like

5435907 beware the leader who bangs the drum of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor for patriotism is indeed a double edged sword it both emboldens the blood just as it narrows the mind and when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry rather the citizenry infused with fear and patriotism will offer up all of their rights to the leader and gladly so how do i know for this is what i have done and i am julius caesar

5435915 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5435916 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5435917 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5435927 a great site to laugh with and get something out of it its called uselessmen
5435928 so not stupid it should be enshrined if it had a better template
5435929 so what if their advice is useless its absolutely hilarious

5435942 we believe corn ethanol will continue to be an important part of the fuel supply
5435943 you get to somewhere around 15 billion gallons and youve got problems
5435944 moving to microbial systems then you start to get real
5435945 instead of the entire surface area of land like with corn ethanol it is something reasonable and you can create energy on a big scale
5435946 then there are non edible seed oils and algae has a huge potential
5435947 i cant recall any type of alternative energy that hasnt been viscously attacked
5435948 the most powerful tool an investor has and are typically used as a weapon of last resort
5435949 in general activist investors really view proxy wars as something to avoid its not something you just do the costs are high tens of millions of dollars
5435950 typically proxy wars dont have much effect sometimes they do but its difficult with shareholder inertia most shareholders vote with management
5435951 shouldnt get to the point of proxy war frankly no one wins in a proxy fight a proxy fight represents the failure of management to respond to shareholder concerns boards should have been responsive to shareholders earlier
5435952 if theres any benefit to the icahn yahoo proxy fight its that yahoo management was put on notice that it cant slide by
5435953 proxy fights are disruptive but they do signal that things cant go on as before
5435954 has anything but the interests of yahoo stockholders in mind
5435955 clearly microsoft having failed to advance in search is aligning with the short term objectives of mr icahn to coerce yahoo into selling its core strategic search assets on terms that are highly advantageous to microsoft but disadvantageous to yahoo stockholders
5435956 over the years i have attempted to make changes at many companies but i have yet to see a company distort omit and twist events and facts in the manner that yahoo has done in their press release issued saturday night july 12th
5435957 a strong incentive to strike any deal with microsoft that enables him to recover his investment and get back his money quickly
5435958 its easier to communicate today the technology and the ability to start a proxy war have become easier
5435959 activism is picking up because of the way hedge funds operate
5435960 they are better at organizing people they have tremendous resources and proxy fights are one of their tools proxy fights are one way they can make money
5435961 mutual funds dont want to run the business if they dont like something they will just sell shares hedge funds will try and run the business to improve the value of firm all shareholders can benefit
5435962 these people have large stakes and their investment in the company is concentrated they want to recoup the investment
5435963 across the globe are trying to control management more its a long running trend

5435973 many consider senegal to be one of the most progressive african countries on the issue of homosexuality
5435974 the government has included a commitment to fighting hiv among men who have sex with men in its national aids response plan since 2005 thats why we found these arrests to be very distressing
5435975 there will be no room for an open and inclusive discussion on the human rights dimensions of hiv in the face of such harassment
5435976 the last judge we were in front of acknowledged that if this were the only charge against mr fayed he would be home by now
5435977 hes only being detained because the los angeles police department has named him as a suspect in the murder of pamela fayed but at this point thats an uncorroborated unsubstantiated allegation no proofs been established to that no charges have been filed on that case and so mr fayed really ought to be released at this point
5435978 decriminalizing all non commercial file sharing and forcing the market to adapt is not just the best solution its the only solution unless we want an ever more extensive control of what citizens do on the internet politicians who play for the antipiracy team should be aware that they have allied themselves with a special interest that is never satisfied and that will always demand that we take additional steps toward the ultimate control state

5435988 if youre speaking about complete support were still behind we dont have dictionaries in indian languages propriet ary software has fonts as well as dictionaries
5435989 we need more support the operating system has enough technical support what we need now are databases glossary of terms in all the languages
5435990 non apple authorised hardware provided an authorised key is available
5435991 ultimately we know that free software is a culture and therefore should obviously be closer to cultural institutions like schools and colleges without tapping that well be missing the boat

5436011 i cant afford this model but when you get cars in the 30 000 range myself and many of my coworkers will be buying one we all love seeing this fantastic engineering jump i and my co workers are rocket scientist at lockheed martin great job tesla crew
5436012 the tesla roadster has regenerative braking but it works differently than the typical hybrid hybrids apply regen braking when the driver steps on the brake pedal the tesla roadster applies variable regen braking based on accelerator position as the driver eases off the accelerator the regen braking is applied regen braking is also a function of the gear selected 2 speed manual gearbox with electric shifing and no clutch first gear has higher regen braking than second in driving it feels very much like a standard transmission gasoline powered car you can actually come to a complete stop without touching the brake pedal also for those who wonder the brake lights are computer controlled and based on measured deceleration rather than the standard switch on the brake pedal btw the doors are solenoid controlled from the outside but the inside door release is mechanical
5436013 i cant wait till they come out with a sedan pickup whatever
5436014 i agree with the practicality issues of only having 2 service locations in the country but the car is neat an electric sports car with those looks built by lotus that can do 0 60 in 4 sec and goes 135mph lets get them to soup one up and go win the special 1 million prize for the first electric car to win its class at lemans
5436015 fantastic job by everyone in your engineering and design department
5436016 i just thought if the front wheels are fitted with a dynamo where every wheel rotation can charge the spare battery in the boot then after the battery gets exhausted the driver will have a fully charged battery for long distance travelling

5436018 an electric car thats bull halibut i bet its ugly like those japanese things
5436019 the strategy of tesla is to enter at the high end of the market where customers are prepared to pay a premium and then drive down market as fast as possible to higher unit volume and lower prices with each successive model
5436020 however lets assume for the moment that the electricity is generated from a hydrocarbon source like natural gas the most popular fuel for new us power plants in recent years

5436022 the electrical outlet to wheel energy efficiency of the tesla roadster is 2 53 km mj x 86 2 18 km mj
5436023 we made the connection that perhaps we could take an old product a capacitor and use a new technology nanotechnology to make that old product in a new way
5436024 thats an effective way to store a large amount of energy
5436025 but the problem is that after many charges and discharges the battery loses capacity to the point where the user has to discard it
5436026 it could be recharged many many times perhaps hundreds of thousands of times and it could be recharged very quickly just in a matter of seconds rather than a matter of hours
5436027 small devices such as hearing aids that could be more quickly recharged where the batteries wouldnt wear out up to larger devices such as automobiles where you could regeneratively re use the energy of motion and therefore improve the energy efficiency and fuel economy
5436028 its better for the environment because it allows the user to not worry about replacing his battery
5436029 it can be discharged and charged hundreds of thousands of times essentially lasting longer than the life of the equipment with which it is associated

5436031 can i upgrade the batteries when my old ones wear out
5436032 uhm we havent really given that a lot of thought our current battery focus is on next vehicle
5436033 that results in 316 83 per month of course that assumes you drove 7604 167 miles in that month
5436034 and we can assume the same 2 78 km mj vehicle efficiency as with the electric car
5436035 you cant succeed because no one has ever succeeded at this sports car making battery power taking on the majors etc etc before

5436067 we are of the opinion that the above hostility towards the rti act of the supreme court amounts to double standards adopted by the sc of late we therefore condemn this irresponsible attitude of the supreme court towards the right to information act we want to remind the judges that they are not lords provided with any special exemptions they are public servants meant to serve the public and are very much accountable to the people
5436068 at least corrupt derelict inefficient uncouth politicians can be thrown out by the people every five years during election time but corrupt derelict inefficient uncouth public servants like ias ips and judges rule over the public for more than 25 30 years
5436069 the judiciary must know that it too is being watched by the public and it too is accountable to the public being one major pillar of democracy like bureaucrats who wanted to escape file notings if the courts prefer to escape the right to information act then all the judgments of various hcs and the sc on right to information will be nothing but mere pontifications

5436086 what does a cow want from life grass and babies and when it gets old and tired it dies a swift and painless death to be honest if you dont eat meat the same amount of animals are going to die just they wont be eaten so have died needlessly
5436087 you and julie should get a room and sex it out some i believe this way youll be able to solve your difference
5436088 i have to wonder what sort of world we live in where more fuss is made when someone is banned from an internet website than when aforementioned person equates the genocide of millions with farming methods
5436089 your views are your views and youre 100 entitled to hold them however you may want to reconsider your rhetoric in posting things like equating consuming meat with nazism and concentration camps
5436090 let me ask you a question it is rather emotive but as i view animal life to be as important as human life i do not consider it to be unreasonably so think nazi death camps you are asked whether or not you would approve of a move to only kill the catholics the roma the disabled and the homosexuals and to spare the jews and the slavs do you approve of this suggestion or would you have to voice your opposition to all of the exterminations
5436091 taking your nazi germany example if the choice was save 2 groups of people from extermination or save none most people would pick save the 2 groups your position seems to be that its pointless to save 2 groups if you cant save them all
5436092 yes it is better than nothing but i wouldnt be advocating for the extermination of the others id be advocating against the extermination of any of them similarly i wont advocate for in vitro meat but against animal farming
5436093 because they are animals they are intellectually inferior and because we can
5436094 i think she was banned because she equated the meat industry to the death camps of the nazis
5436095 in julies case she was warned to tone her rhetoric down after she compared eating meat to nazi death camps but chose to ignore it and went on to post graphic content on animal slaughter which got her banned simple as that
5436096 you dont need to eat all those expensive substitute foods you can eat well on the basics
5436097 if you could ask the animals if they wanted to be slaughtered at such a young age what do you think theyd say
5436098 no animals can be slaughtered in complete comfort and again it would not choose to die
5436099 when we kill animals to eat them they end up killing us because their flesh which contains cholesterol and saturated fat was never intended for human beings who are natural herbivores
5436100 atherosclerosis is one of the easiest diseases to produce experimentally but the experimental animal must be an herbivore
5436101 the science of the matter seems to be contestable it would appear that pro meat counter arguments based on human biology are on slippery ground
5436102 ethically speaking it seems ironic and foolish to be slagging off a vegan for arguing against meat eating on a thread started for the purpose of debating whether or not people should eat meat why pose the question if you dont want people to express their views on it

5436144 there is something i need to tell you kid i didnt want to be the one to do it there really isnt an easy way to say it you see um well youre sort of dead
5436145 most of us find out before it gets embarrassing i just didnt want you to go home and freak your family out some people dont handle it too well when their dead son walks through the door
5436146 so you are saying that i dont have to breath
5436147 if this is a dream then you better get used to it this is the longest nightmare that you are ever going to have

5436150 are you a ghost is that why i cant see you
5436151 i am hiding because i didnt want to scare you the last time i just popped out on someone i spent the next week putting myself back together you cant be too careful with your bones nowadays
5436152 you start out looking normal like you do now and then you begin to decay first you bloat and get all smelly hopefully you dry up before too long otherwise your skin just falls off a chunk at a time eventually bones are all you have left
5436153 only a couple hundred years and thats if you are lucky
5436154 after your bones fall apart all you have left is a spirit ghosts cant do much they dont have any way to affect the living world without a body or skeleton all you can do then really is find a nice house to haunt
5436155 no if you were evil you would have gone to hell
5436156 no if you were good you would have gone to heaven
5436157 how did you know when you were watching us on the dam that i was average enough to end up like this
5436158 i didnt know i just hoped you looked like the kind of kid that no one notices they like having you around to laugh at their jokes and do their dirty work but thats about it when i left the dam your friends were still playing i dont even know if they realized that you were gone most people are just too darn annoying good or bad not to notice you and i were too average
5436159 we give the people that didnt have the time to notice us when we were alive another chance it is really a lot of fun
5436160 we dont try to hurt anyone most of us anyway we just try to make them pee their pants its a noble pursuit in my estimation besides what else is there to do
5436161 sure i can see it now bobby the bloated zombie shows up at a widows house and offers to do her dishes somehow i dont see anything good coming out of that situation really with thoughts like that i dont know how you missed your wings heaven must have filled its quota to have missed an angel like you
5436162 i know that this is all new to you but you have to take advantage of the situation you are in the prime of death there is nothing more scarey than a half decomposed monster you have to take advantage while you still have your voice box
5436163 you can still moan groan hurl insults and all that kind of good stuff all i can do is rattle chains
5436164 if you were still alive you wouldnt hear a thing i cant communicate with the living i could scratch a message in the dirt i guess but what human is going to wait around long enough for that
5436165 do you have anyone in mind for your first spook

5436200 it seems like the department of defense has copied what you hear about with large law firms where if youre looking for one document they send you 400 000 documents so the one you need is hidden in plain sight

5436202 we will at their request mail an entire copy of the case file even if it contains classified documents
5436203 the current focus should be on motivating foreign governments to provide answers not on again whip lashing ourselves
5436204 our government has been lambasted by family members for not doing enough
5436205 ive been to these labs and i can tell you that the government has done more than the average person could possibly know about when i saw the work that goes into every case and when they saw that i was hard nosed and tough but sincere about what i was doing and willing to listen i gained access to all of those agencies i became friends with the people working on my brothers case
5436206 if i got a piece of information from the jpac joint pow mia accounting command lab id check with the department of defense and the state department too
5436207 if the stories i got were all consistent i went quiet if they werent consistent thats when id start asking questions

5436252 the petition is the gops latest try at forcing house democratic leaders to bring legislation aimed at boosting domestic energy production to the floor before the house leaves for its august recess
5436253 republicans confident that the soaring price of gasoline has handed them an issue they can use in the fall campaign say that majority democrats have consistently blocked attempts to boost domestic oil and gas production and that the public is becoming increasingly aware of this

5436274 bounty killer has performed murder music songs and has ridiculed other singers who have agreed to halt their encouragement of queer bashing attacks
5436275 bounty killer bragged that he was invincible he vowed his concerts would go ahead and boasted that no gays could stop him look whos crying now
5436276 there must be zero tolerance of singers like bounty killer who advocate the murder of other human beings
5436277 a white singer who called for the killing of black people would be banned from performing
5436278 a similar ban should also apply to singers who incite the murder of gays and lesbians incitement to violence and murder is a criminal offence in every country in the world we want the law enforced
5436279 we have no problem with reggae or dancehall music only with singers who abuse the genre to incite violence against lesbian and gay people
5436280 there are many great reggae and dancehall stars who do not stoop to murder music we salute them
5436281 there is no need for singers to spout violent anti gay hatred they choose to do so it is wilful and malicious homophobia and therefore they must expect to suffer a backlash
5436282 our campaign is in solidarity with black lesbian and gay people in jamaica and the caribbean who suffer nightmarish levels of homophobic violence we are acting at their request and in support of their right to live their lives free of the threat of violence
5436283 bounty killer is a big headed bare faced bigot he has released songs inciting the killing of gay people and defended his right to demand death to queers
5436284 six other top jamaican singers have signed the reggae compassionate act but bounty killer has refused under the rca artistes agree to not perform songs that encourage or glorify violence including homophobic violence
5436285 the metropolitan police are back tracking on past agreements previously they said singers would not be allowed to perform unless they signed the rca this was the precondition for buju bantons concert to proceed at the brixton academy last year
5436286 the police seem to be letting bounty killer off the hook
5436287 police claims that they are cracking down on homophobic hate crimes now look like a public relations stunt at the expense of the lesbian and gay community
5436288 a white racist singer who advocated killing black people would not be allowed to perform anywhere in london even if he agreed to not incite the killing of black people at his concert

5436324 the web is now the first place journalists investors and stakeholders turn for information and pr people know it the press release actually has more value today from an archival stand point than as a news breaking tool as long as people can find them when they want them online
5436325 and beyond just making sure people can find your news on the web the real opportunity of online pr is using your news to introduce constituents to your online presence by participating in relevant digital conversations which contrary to popular opinion you dont need a blog to do much as the news of the day presents an opportunity to get a company brand or product in front of the media that same information online presents an opportunity to attract and build a digital constituency by providing people with information when they want it rather than when you decide to push it over the news wire or when the wire decides theyre not going to keep it online any longer

5436344 im proud to be associated with conquest racing for 2008 and beyond said anthony blumberg of his latest acquisition
5436345 conquest racing is team with whom we made our champ car debut at surfers paradise this year giving me a taste of the american open wheel scene
5436346 our aim over the next couple of years is to develop and promote talent from within the junior formulas of australian and asian championships and whilst our involvement with conquest in no way guarantees a drive for any of those talented young opes prime backed drivers it does provide an opportunity which is what we are all about
5436347 im thrilled to welcome opes prime as partners with conquest racing although we have fielded competitive entries the last five years in champ car with good results the addition of opes prime and anthony blumberg offers us the opportunity to solidify our base of operations and plan for the growth required not just to compete but to win

5436364 the fight against terrorism is also a fight for the rights and dignity of women
5436365 the main misconception is to perceive iraqi women as silent powerless victims in a male controlled society in urgent need of liberation this image fits conveniently into the big picture of the iraqi people being passive victims who would welcome the occupation of their country the reality is different
5436366 i am here we will not keep silent we will be campaigning to keep religion a private matter
5436367 just being a woman in iraq is enough to be a prime target for violence to be killed raped or sold
5436368 we believe that in any society that is not secular there is no room for womens rights
5436369 we had a secular society we had rights we didnt have a theocracy
5436370 what can we learn from the countries that have already gone through this how do you walk out of this room with a sense that it is still possible to do something what sustains you in this work what helps you not walk away from this but stay with it

5436375 you have to turn those nonfood materials into sugar and then convert that to ethanol
5436376 we can do it today but its not economically feasible on a large scale so our challenge was to engineer a microbe that would digest the sugars and turn them into fuel and do it economically
5436377 if we hit our research targets we are going to have a low cost solution from a nonfood renewable source and this is without government subsidies thats the ultimate goal a low cost solution that doesnt require long term subsidies
5436378 we have to figure out how to get the cost of carbon internalized in the price of energy
5436379 if we do that we wouldnt need subsidies for new fuels
5436380 we at dupont look at global warming like the ozone hole over the antarctica

5436385 at the same time our customers are used to being in control and private aviation is about freedom and control so we didnt want to put too many rules on them
5436386 netjets had to change the way it did business and to cut its emissions wherever it could in the short run
5436387 it also had to show that it was contributing to the long run solution for global warming
5436388 with offsets for every unit of carbon emissions that you put into the atmosphere youre eliminating or offsetting it somewhere else
5436389 the beauty of offsetting is that the atmosphere doesnt care where you take the carbon out
5436390 25 an hour for a small jet and 60 to 65 an hour for a larger one
5436391 to put that in perspective private jet flight costs about 5 000 to 6 000 an hour so its less than one percent of the cost
5436392 we have to be considerate in how we communicate with our customers these are people with lots of demands on their attention and time and they expect that were not going to bother them plus some of our clients come to us through corporations and they are tricky to communicate with a lot of our communication doesnt get to the person whos using and benefiting from the service

5436402 economically you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years instead of working at a low intensity for forty years you work as hard as you possibly can for four this pays especially well in technology where you earn a premium for working fast

5436421 contradicting their own statements the police first said that the men were all dressed in womens clothing then that articles of female clothing and cosmetics were found in their belongings which somehow proves that they were engaging in same sex marriage and homosexuality the rhetoric of the police and court authorities are confusing at best and attempt to incite the public against the young men by conflating the concepts of homosexuality cross dressing and gay marriage

5436636 we really recognise that the church has been completely silent on the issue of embracing a homosexual community and if anything actually has been quite hostile

5436644 im thrilled im really really excited about it that glen decided to call me even if it took a little bit into free agency
5436645 basically i was hoping that he was going to do it and im glad he did im just excited to be staying with the organization that gave me a chance three years ago when nobody wanted me
5436646 i need to be the highest paid player to earn respect stance
5436647 you go right now from entry level to what used to be the third contract thanks to two offer sheets from kevin lowe
5436648 most general managers dont like starting fights with any other managers thanks to the edmonton oilers the second contract has disappeared
5436649 everything i said a year ago has come true every single word
5436650 i think an offer sheet its a tool certainly a team is entitled to use
5436651 my issue here is this is the second time this year in my opinion edmonton have offered a grossly inflated salary for a player and it impacts on all 30 teams and i think its an act of desperation by a general manager who is fighting to keep his job
5436652 i was not notified of this until an agent faxed it into us
5436653 i thought kevin would have called me and told me it was coming i thought that was gutless
5436654 if i had run my team into the sewer like that i wouldnt throw a grenade at the other 29 teams and my own indirectly

5436659 when everyone was afraid of touching the prince of wales trophy and he just lifted it up and skated around with it
5436660 too late ive been missing him for 2 years already
5436661 for me my favourite memory of him will come july 1st
5436662 when he came out and got in 2 fights in the first game of the season that was the last time i ever saw his old self
5436663 his on ice history is a mixed bag but there is no doubting the quality individual he has been while with the organization
5436664 other than the completely unfounded rumours and false allegations of illicit narcotic use

5436666 big 3 whoever that might turn into to zetterberg datsyuk and holstrom aaahhh july a time for dreams
5436667 one thing that was fairly evident the rangers as a team did not consistently outwork their opponents
5436668 i think if i would have played good with scotty or dru then id still be here
5436669 then everything would be good there would be a different balance
5436670 they signed two players last year gomez and drury to help the team and we didnt play together the rangers gave them so much money and they were kind of pushed on the side i dont think thats good but when we played together it wasnt the best scenario for the team
5436671 nobody ever thought that was going to happen but i was playing my best when i was with dubi rookie center brandon dubinsky that was our best lineup but i dont think you can keep doing that with scotty pushed down to no 2 and dru to no 3 plus then you have to go out and get a winger for dru or scotty
5436672 you have to admit i did a good job for the money they paid me
5436673 lets be honest you cant look just at last year it was not my best year it was probably my worst by points but it happened but youve got to look at the whole picture
5436674 that first year 2005 06 nobody gave us any chance to be anything other than the worst team in hockey nobody gave us a chance to even fight for the playoffs or even be in the picture halfway through the season and we did it
5436675 the fans wanted more i know i wanted more i wanted the cup but you have to be lucky to win the cup no matter how good you are
5436676 do i think i can still do it that i still can score 100 points yes i still believe i can score 40 goals i didnt do it last year i had a bad year it happens to everybody
5436677 im not the guy to say any bad stuff about the rangers or glennie or tom renney
5436678 they were always very good to me i think glen is a great guy and i love him
5436679 oh i called his agent and he didnt call me back
5436680 once again the level of intelligence is measured by ones ability to have a civil debate without infantile perdonal attacks and other such nonsense
5436681 and i also want to say to the people like mike milbury who made their living by criticizing me all the time that they can kiss my butt
5436682 you know money determines your position on the team especially in the nhl
5436683 as a top earner you have more respect they treat you differently than other cheaper players but what i pursue the most is trust
5436684 ive already realized that i was playing my best hockey when there was the most pressure on me i need to hear or need to know this is your team you are the key element and it will do as you will do then i can play my best hockey and i feel i can still play on the highest level
5436685 its more important for me to be a ranger than to worry about being the highest paid player on this team we have unfinished work here and i want to see it through
5436686 he still hoped that sather would make him an offer that would enable him to remain the teams centerpiece as he sees it an offer that kept him the teams highest paid player

5436704 they were not those kind of steroids they were anti inflammatories
5436705 we did steroids to get away the aches and the speed of healing
5436706 my use of steroids from a doctor was to speed up healing after injury and thought nothing of it it was to speed up the healing process that was it it wasnt to get bigger and stronger and faster

5436717 we wanted to find something that you could scale infinitely
5436718 we want to take it to a whole new level

5436721 this was a fantastic project to work on bringing together a number of different organisations and truly engaging the young people by bringing history to life the fun they had researching and recording the play made the whole project worthwhile
5436722 the 1911 census holds more information than the 1901 census it is also the first census where the householder s schedule has remained the master entry rather than the enumerator s notes so researchers are actually able in most cases to view their actual ancestors handwriting when looking at 1911 census entries this will be an invaluable resource for anyone who is working hard to trace their family s history
5436723 the 1911 census records will provide a mine of important historical information and i m delighted that the national archives has chosen to work with scotland online on this momentous project we have a strong track record in the field of genealogy having worked in partnership with the general register office for scotland since 2002 to publish almost 50 million pages of scottish historical records all of which are now available to view online
5436724 to be involved in a project like this is important for the national archives

5436949 in essentially all elections one vote has effectively no chance of determining the outcome
5436950 rational choice theory predicts no one would vote because most of the time voting doesnt change the outcome
5436951 if a persons marginal benefit from voting is a function only of the probability that her vote determines the election and there is an opportunity cost of voting then because the likelihood of affecting the election outcome is essentially 0 rational choice says the person would not vote
5436952 if a persons marginal benefit of voting is a function of the good feeling felt after voting and there is an opportunity cost of voting then rational choice says that only persons who receive a sufficiently strong good feeling will vote

5436963 the move is designed to attract greater foreign investment and is part of the countrys sweeping economic liberalization program iran will no longer make a distinction between domestic and foreign firms that wish to purchase state run companies as long as the combined foreign ownership in any particular industry does not exceed 35 as an example a foreign firm may purchase an iranian steel company but it would not be allowed to buy every business enterprise in irans steel industry among the new incentive measures announced foreign firms may also transfer their annual profit from their iranian company out of the country in any currency they wish

5437036 the u s military can play a critical role in building indigenous capacity but should generally resist being drawn into combat operations in muslim countries where its presence is likely to increase terrorist recruitment

5437045 the highly unequal economy whereby the rich and the financial sector capture most of the income but hide it by providing cheap debt to the middle classes so that they can continue to spend
5437046 o ne of the more attractive features of the financial world for its promoters is its ability to concentrate huge fortunes in a small number of hands and promote this as a good thing these people are said to be creating wealth rather than capturing it o f course the reality is that such wealth concentration is created by squeezing the rest as is obvious in the stagnation of incomes for most in the middle and lower rungs of society this is not so much wealth creation as wealth redistribution from the many to the few but what has made this unequality tolerable is that the financial world itself was able to provide a convenient smokescreen in the form of cheap debt provided in abundance to all the wealthy used it to grab real assets in funny money and the rest were kindly allowed to keep on spending by tapping their future income rather than their insufficient current one in a nutshell the debt bubble hid the class warfare waged by the rich against everybody else
5437047 the income capture mechanisms set up during the bubble have not been reversed so the pain is falling disproportionately on the poorest

5437055 you have to excuse john hes only caught up to 1969 so far
5437056 outlining a clandestine anti terror campaign in 80 countries around the world what he was ready to propose represented a striking and risky departure for u s policy and would give the cia the broadest and most lethal authority in its history
5437057 the heart of the proposal was a recommendation that the president give the cia what tenet labeled
5437058 to allow the agency to operate without restraint and he wanted encouragement from the president to take risks
5437059 another proposal was that the cia increase liaison work with key foreign intelligence services
5437060 using such intelligence services as surrogates could triple or quadruple the cias effectiveness
5437061 described covert operations in 80 countries that were either underway or that he was now recommending the actions ranged from routine propaganda to lethal covert action in preparation for military attacks
5437062 in some countries cia teams would break into facilities to obtain information
5437063 commit terror to incite terror in order to react to terror
5437064 summer study on special operations and joint forces in support of countering terrorism
5437065 proposals appear to push the military into territory that traditionally has been the domain of the cia raising questions about whether such missions would be subject to the same legal restraints imposed on cia activities
5437066 the cia executes the plans but they use department of defense assets
5437067 recommends the creation of a super intelligence support activity an organization it dubs the proactive preemptive operations group p2og to bring together cia and military covert action information warfare intelligence and cover and deception for example the pentagon and cia would work together to increase human intelligence humint forward operational presence and to deploy new clandestine technical capabilities
5437068 stimulating reactions among terrorists and states possessing weapons of mass destruction meaning it would prod terrorist cells into action thus exposing them to quick response attacks by us forces
5437069 the defense department is building up an elite secret army with resources stretching across the full spectrum of covert capabilities new organizations are being created the missions of existing units are being revised
5437070 are trained to turn hardened terrorists into coalition spies using methods developed on the mean streets of ulster during the troubles when the army managed to infiltrate the ira at almost every level since war broke out in iraq in 2003 they have been responsible for running dozens of iraqi double agents
5437071 w orking alongside the special air service sas and the american delta force as part of the baghdad based counter terrorist unit known as task force black
5437072 during the troubles in northern ireland the jsg operated under the cover name of the force research unit fru which between the early 1980s and the late 1990s managed to penetrate the very heart of the ira
5437073 the unit was renamed following the stevens inquiry into allegations of collusion between the security forces and protestant paramilitary groups and until relatively recently continued to work exclusively in northern ireland
5437074 contains devastating confirmation that intelligence officers of the british police and the military actively helped protestant guerillas to identify and kill catholic activists in northern ireland during the 1980s
5437075 highlighted collusion the willful failure to keep records the absence of accountability the withholding of intelligence and the extreme of agents being involved in murder
5437076 charges relate to activities of a british army intelligence outfit known as the force research unit fru and former royal ulster constabulary ruc police officers
5437077 he was told by his military handlers that his collusion with paramilitaries was sanctioned by margaret thatcher herself
5437078 i broke the law seven days a week and my handlers knew that
5437079 security forces didnt intercept the real iras omagh bombing team because one of the terrorists was a british double agent whose cover would have been blown as an informer if the operation was uncovered
5437080 phoned a warning to his ruc handlers 48 hours before the omagh bombing that the real ira was planning an attack and gave details of one of the bombing team and his car registration
5437081 the man thought to be the agent is a senior member of the ira organization
5437082 one of the most feared men inside the provisional ira
5437083 magee led the iras internal security unit for more than a decade up to the mid 90s most of those he investigated were usually executed
5437084 magees unit was tasked to hunt down interrogate and execute suspected british agents within the ira
5437085 two british agents were central to the bombings of three army border installations in 1990
5437086 involved forcing civilians to drive vehicles laden with explosives into army checkpoints
5437087 a former british army mole in the ira has claimed that mi5 arranged a weapons buying trip to america in which he obtained detonators later used by terrorists to murder soldiers and police officers
5437088 british intelligence co operated with the fbi to ensure his trip to new york in the 1990s went ahead without incident so that his cover would not be blown
5437089 the technology he obtained has been used in northern ireland and copied by terrorists in iraq in roadside bombs that have killed british troops
5437090 who eventually pass the course can expect to be posted to baghdad basra and afghanistan
5437091 the word on the street in baghdad is that the cessation of suicide car bombings is proof that the cia was behind them
5437092 the u s induces aggression if you dont attack me i will never attack you the u s is stimulating the aggression of the iraqi people
5437093 captured in the act of setting off a car bomb in baghdad
5437094 a number of iraqis apprehended two americans disguised in arab dress as they tried to blow up a booby trapped car in the middle of a residential area in western baghdad on tuesday residents of western baghdads al ghazaliyah district said the people had apprehended the americans as they left their caprice car near a residential neighborhood in al ghazaliyah on tuesday afternoon local people found they looked suspicious so they detained the men before they could get away that was when they discovered that they were americans and called the police
5437095 the iraq police arrived at approximately the same time as allied military forces and the two men were removed from iraq custody and whisked away before any questioning could take place
5437096 people from the area claim that the man was taken away not because he shot anyone but because he knew too much about the bomb rumor has it that he saw an american patrol passing through the area and pausing at the bomb site minutes before the explosion soon after they drove away the bomb went off and chaos ensued he ran out of his house screaming to the neighbors and bystanders that the americans had either planted the bomb or seen the bomb and done nothing about it he was promptly taken away
5437097 to report to an american military camp near baghdad airport for interrogation and in order to retrieve his license
5437098 the driver did leave in a hurry but was soon alarmed with a feeling that his car was driving as if carrying a heavy load and he also became suspicious of a low flying helicopter that kept hovering overhead as if trailing him
5437099 the fbis counterterrorism unit has launched a broad investigation of us based theft rings after discovering some vehicles used in deadly car bombings in iraq including attacks that killed us troops and iraqi civilians were probably stolen in the united states according to senior us government officials
5437100 the inquiry began after coalition troops raided a falluja bomb factory last november and found a texas registered four wheel drive being prepared for a bombing mission
5437101 does not rule out western involvement in this weeks askariya mosque bombing
5437102 dates back to a still secret strategy in the reagan administrations battle against the leftist guerrilla insurgency in el salvador in the early 1980s
5437103 one pentagon proposal would send special forces teams to advise support and possibly train iraqi squads most likely hand picked kurdish peshmerga fighters and shiite militiamen to target sunni insurgents and their sympathizers even across the border into syria according to military insiders familiar with the discussions
5437104 the pentagon is considering forming hit squads of kurdish and shia fighters to target leaders of the iraqi insurgency in a strategic shift borrowed from the american struggle against left wing guerrillas in central america 20 years ago under the so called el salvador option iraqi and american forces would be sent to kill or kidnap insurgency leaders
5437105 hit squads would be controversial and would probably be kept secret
5437106 john negroponte the us ambassador in baghdad had a front row seat at the time as ambassador to honduras from 1981 85
5437107 what is particularly striking is that many of those killings have taken place since the police commandos became operationally active and often correspond with areas where they have been deployed
5437108 i was a soldier in the iraqi army in the war of 1991 and during the withdrawal from kuwait i decided to seek asylum in saudi arabia along with dozens of others like me that was how began the process whereby i was recruited into the american forces for there were us military committees that chose a number of iraqis who were willing to volunteer to join them and be transported to america i was one of those
5437109 carry out specific tasks assigned him by the us agencies
5437110 in charge of a group of a unit that carried out assassinations in the streets of baghdad
5437111 our task was to carry out assassinations of individuals the us occupation army would supply us with their names pictures and maps of their daily movements to and from their place of residence and we were supposed to kill the shii for example in the and kill the sunni in the of madinat as sadr and so on
5437112 anyone in the unit who made a mistake was killed three members of my team were killed by us occupation forces after they failed to assassinate sunni political figures in baghdad
5437113 doesnt only carry out assassinations but some of them specialize in planting bombs and car bombs in neighborhoods and markets
5437114 operations of planting car bombs and blowing up explosives in markets are carried out in various ways the best known and most famous among the us troops is placing a bomb inside cars as they are being searched at checkpoints
5437115 the evidence that the us directly contributed to the creation of the current civil war in iraq by its own secretive security strategy is compelling
5437116 will turkey be complicit in another war against another neighbour
5437117 the middle east is capable of a very bright future a place of innovation and discovery driven by free men and women in recent years weve seen hopeful beginnings toward this vision turkey a nation with a majority muslim population is a prosperous modern democracy afghanistan under the leadership of president karzai is overcoming the taliban and building a free society iraq under the leadership of prime minister maliki is establishing a multi ethnic democracy
5437118 given its growing equities in the middle east as well as the current strains in u s turkish relations turkey will be even more reluc tant to allow the united states to use its bases in the future particu larly the u s airbase at incirlik to undertake combat operations in the middle east turkey is unlikely to support u s policies aimed at isolating iran and syria or overthrowing the regimes in either country
5437119 shahab 3 could strike most of turkey and the middle east and the longer range missiles would reach deeper into europe
5437120 iran has run clandestine nuclear programs for more than two decades and those programs are a threat to turkey as well as to the u
5437121 bilateral relations are deep excellent and sincerely felt turkey had a pivotal role to play on regional issues such as the conflict in iraq and concern over irans nuclear programme
5437122 for us turkey is as important now as it has ever been abroad turkey is uniquely positioned as a bridge between east and west at a crucial time for the european union and the world in general mr president abdullah gul you are playing a key role in promoting peace political stability and economic development in some of the worlds most unsettled areas
5437123 i think this is a very important and exciting moment for the european union and for turkey and i believe we have an historic opportunity to send the clearest possible signal that the european union wants turkey inside the european family as a full partner
5437124 enhanced co operation on the terrorist threat posed by pkk al qaida and other associated extremist groups
5437125 support for the un security council process on iran including for full implementation of any measures imposed
5437126 further co operation between the uk and turkish armed forces and mutual support in nato fora
5437127 co operation to ensure that nato can fully implement the deliverables agreed at the 2006 riga summit
5437128 i think the war itself was a remarkable victory it went better than most people expected
5437129 i believe discussion about the iraq war has clouded the debate about promoting democracy around the world i understand the doubts about iraq and afghanistan and the deep concerns at the mistakes made but my plea is that we do not let divisions over those conflicts obscure our national interest never mind our moral impulse in supporting movements for democracy in the 1990s the left seemed conflicted between the desirability of the goal and its qualms about the use of military means in fact the goal of spreading democracy should be a great progressive project the means need to combine soft and hard power
5437130 the agreement provides a comprehensive framework for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the united states and turkey under agreed non proliferation conditions and controls
5437131 the infamous iran syria policy and operations group isog created in early 2006 integrated by officials from the white house the us state department the cia and the treasury department had a mandate to destabilize syria and iran and bring about regime change
5437132 18 the same day during his visit to the us which also included his participation to the bilderberg meeting for the fifth time 19 turkish foreign minister ali babacan held a press conference with his us counterpart condaleezza rice
5437133 until mid 2003 iran has built nuclear installations and conducted uranium enrichment work secretly from the international atomic agency iaea it approved inspections by the iaea but didnt implement this through a constitutional process iran needs to inspire trust that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes entirely irans adoption of sensible policies which will prevent new problems arising in the region is very important in terms of restoring a peaceful and stable middle east
5437134 highly secret preparations on covert struggle methods to be used in an operation which will be conducted together with our armed forces in the event of a violation of our countrys territorial integrity by an enemy force
5437135 this is a very old concept from the cold war era which is no longer valid if within the context of nato warsaw pact turkey were to be invaded by the soviets then there would be resistance in occupied areas this is over we currently dont have such structure as there is no need for it in fact who would invade turkey
5437136 turkey is the only nato member that faces the threat of outside attack iran syria it is thus very concerned that article 5 collective defense remains a core alliance mission and that emphasis on crisis management does not weaken the alliances commitment to collective defense

5437291 she was fated to bear with pains and groaning and to send successive generations into life
5437292 indeed i believe it is the greatest salvation when a woman does not think apart from her husband and bringing all things before him as is right does not listen to the allurements of another but is in agreement with her rightful husband
5437293 for wretched woman does not cease from pains giving birth not giving birth and fleeing children

5437297 for he would not be able not to be good but he would not help you if you are unwilling for he has not placed a law of force upon mortals nor is his will tyrannical
5437298 for god will not force you to be wise in the choice and decision of mortals is his wisdom in all things always some angel or mortal i know not which said these things as i have said them to the traitor
5437299 mother of god may the doer die justice knows and the foul disciple will pay a just price
5437300 your faith is gone it died long before revealed as such do you dare see the light wretch or do you think the god of before does not still rule or that the yoke of justice now lies idle
5437301 be gone foul doer destroyer of love i spit nor should i even mention your name for god abhors the betrayer o child why did you give to men clear proofs to know the worth of gold but no bodily stamp of men by which to distinguish good from evil or knowing yourself do you want others not to know
5437302 women who are close to this disaster i will not bear the unbearable i will hurl myself away i will release my body dying i will recede from life farewell i am no longer myself

5437305 mother of god first of all whether blame does or does not attach to woman she will have bad reputation if she does not remain at home inside
5437306 the serpent contrived by the error of woman to cast him from the garden and the sky but god contrived against him in return to be born from woman and remaining god to become mortal and slaughter the destroyer of mortals destroy him and cast him underfoot
5437307 chorus illustrious most beautiful maiden rich as you say in your offspring god these things you know now consider the future for we know that you are wiser than mortals and that seeing these things you also know their end
5437308 mother of god i lament them and i bewail the deed that would next be done by those who crucified you child
5437309 for you will easily kill our enemy and you will cast down death and arising swiftly you will take revenge upon your torturers but woman is weak and naturally prone to tears and so i lament and am struck by barbs of pain and grieve wretchedly i have glory but nevertheless am destroyed since i am stripped of your divine sight
5437310 why do you cry peter you have done terrible things but you can still obtain forgiveness oh child oh beloved oh word of god forgive him men sin child and peter sinned from fear of the mob
5437311 christ virgin mother go away now strong i absolve the sin of peter as you ask for i have always obeyed your words because of your pious and noble heart

5437313 theologian for nobly scraping away the bane of old age the bane of man ruining corruption let him make me a flourishing young man since now most evil old age emaciates all oh how old age destroys me with a burden of pains from the outrage of our ancient mother decieved
5437314 half chorus of all things that have souls and sense we women are the most miserable creatures who having begotten children see them die
5437315 but you virgin have now known the bed of a man you heard your conception from an angel of god you say how can you now bear to see him as a corpse
5437316 joseph for as is fitting though i have no relation of kin i also honor his corpse as mine how we should take him or what we should do for the corpse to please you consider but if you follow my counsel keep silent for this is always most seemly nor will you see outrage against your dead child for i do not deny that i am jewish but i will never be able to believe that your child was not noble not even if the whole race disagrees or fills the mountain wood with words since i know that he was noble
5437317 mother of god these wretches have not et recognized your birth which came down to earth from fathers heaven and so you must show them that you are god and you will show them entirely and if the race of jews you wish to expel from the land in anger you will drive them to the roman hosts whom they thoughtlessly chose to rule them since they rejected your mastery and took up caesar as their lord for i see the punishement of your life bearing death fire near homes and the foundation of palaces already in ruins the unquenchable gleam of fire the immortal anger of god at this city
5437318 magdalene i saw two angles dressed in white sitting above and below the tomb the one at the head the other at the foot and seeing their divine brilliance i stood astonished with joy and fear and then i heard a voice in my ears unlike anything and began to tremble again and straight away i saw christ in a new appearance i have said it was not easy to approach his form and i fell on the ground and embraced his feet
5437319 christ look at my hands and feet and seeing my pierced side clearly know me that i am again myself for a spirit does not have flesh at all and a spirit does not possess bones as you now see that i have them and touching me see that i have these things this is how my father sent me here in this way too i send you to the world and i breathe the holy spirit into you my friends and you must take this and announce me to all with the father and the holy spirit
5437320 narrator roayl one queen most blessed virgin you dwell in the seat of the blessed heaven having escaped all mortal suffering wrapped in the robe of immortality always ageless and known as god from above please be kind to my words

5437400 considering the current debate about agricultural land being used to produce biofuels algae may well be a significant future alternative fuel source as we set about tackling climate change
5437401 while most other biodiesels come from agricultural crops like canola soy and palm oil algae can be grown with ease in ponds or tanks on poor quality land
5437402 the new process will maintain carbon in the energy cycle and when placed beside a coal or gas fired power station the algae farm can consume 50 of the carbon dioxide in the exhaust gas
5437403 the process then produces algal oil which can easily be transformed into biodiesel and glycerine
5437404 the first stage will be the identification and development of suitable algae strains to achieve stable continuous high yield algae production
5437405 the environmental benefits of using algae to create biodiesel and feedstock are enormous
5437406 companies that do produce carbon dioxide will eventually be able to claim carbon credits as the carbon dioxide can be stored or captured and released into algae farms
5437407 in our view the production of biodiesel complements ethanol as an alternative renewable fuel for queensland so this is the kind of project we are keen to support
5437408 biodiesel is a clean burning alternative fuel for diesel engines

5437420 one of the major issues discussed is that in the interpretation of english literary texts we should come out of colonial mindset in the dissection of the text readers teachers students and researchers should not employ western critical tools like catharsis fancy imagination impressionism expressionism new criticism formalism structuralism neo historicism post structuralism deconstruction and reader response theory etc rather indian critical theories like rasa alamkara dhwani and vakrokti should be employed for the close analysis of the english texts the propagators of this logic base their arguments on post colonial thought of edward said gayatri chakravorty spivak and gauri vishwanathan the supporters of indian response to english literature in the manner of edward said emphasize that there is a political subtext of the main stream western writing
5437421 this colonization of the indian mind began with macaulays celebrated minute which declared that it was necessary and possible
5437422 the great object of the british government ought to be the promotion of european literature and science among the natives of india and all funds appropriated for the purpose of education would be best employed on english education alone
5437423 another major task of post colonialists in india is to remove certain colonial english texts from the syllabi of indian universities because these texts were used by the colonizer to subvert us alter our thought process and induce us into believing their superiority and our inferiority some literary texts are completely irrelevant to india take for example the licentious restoration comedies of manners obscene and vulgar novels of sex maniac dh lawrence and the fleshly poetry of the pre raphaelites these authors do hurt pious sensibility still they are taught to the impressionable minds of post graduate students of english literature the alien authors have no appeal for us they do not affect our society

5437721 it is not enough that we preach correctly which the hireling can also do but we must watch over the sheep that the wolves false teachers may not break in and we must contend for the sheep against the wolves with the word of god even to the sacrifice of our lives such are good shepherds of whom few are found
5437722 for nothing can feed or give life to the soul which is not the doctrine of christ although the hireling does not himself slay and destroy he does not restrain the wolf therefore because you neither point out nor teach this shepherd you shall not and ought not to be heard but you shall be shunned as a wolf
5437723 they the false teachers fared like a man who looks through a colored glass put before such a man whatever color you please he sees no other color than that of the glass the fault is not that the right color is not put before him but that his glass is colored differently as the word of isaiah 6 9 puts it you will see he says and yet you will not see it
5437724 we believe teach and confess that at a time of confession as when enemies of the word of god desire to suppress the pure doctrine of the holy gospel the entire community of god yes every individual christian and especially the ministers of the word as the leaders of the community of god are obligated to confess openly not only by words but also through their deeds and actions the true doctrine and all that pertains to it according to the word of god in such a case we should not yield to adversaries even in matters of indifference nor should we tolerate the imposition of such ceremonies on us by adversaries in order to undermine the genuine worship of god and to introduce and confirm their idolatry by force or chicanery it is written for freedom christ has set us free stand fast therefore and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery galatians 5 1
5437725 dr luther who understood the true intention of the augsburg confession better than any one else remained by it steadfastly and defended it constantly until he died shortly before his death in his last confession he repeated his faith in this article with great fervor and wrote as follows i reckon them all as belonging together that is as sacramentarians and enthusiasts for that is what they are who will not believe that the lords bread in the supper is his true natural body which the godless or judas receive orally as well as st peter and all the saints whoever i say will not believe this will please let me alone and expect no fellowship from me this is final
5437726 is it possible that one who has such models as luther walther stoeckhardt lochner sieck c c schmidt and wessel etc etc should leave these rich pastures to feed upon such garbage heaps as those from whom i have quoted
5437727 it is the purpose of this volume to aid in displacing books of reformed preachers we would encourage the cultivation of distinctly lutheran preaching therefore we now appeal to our brethren always to consult luther when preparing to preach quo propior luthero eo melior theologus let us who are called lutheran preachers be sure that in every one of our sermons we preach gods word and luthers doctrine pure it is that preaching which god demands of us 1 peter 4 11 it was that preaching which conquered the roman goliath revelation 12 11 by that preaching we shall truly build the walls of zion not with hay straw and stubble but with such stones as all the powers of hell shall never overthrow luke 21 15
5437728 in like manner we will also do to our princes and priests when they attack our manner of life we should suffer it and show love for hatred good for evil but when they attack our doctrine gods honor is attacked then love and patience should cease and we should not keep silent but also say i honor my father and you dishonor me yet i do not inquire whether you dishonor me for i do not seek my own honor

5437752 the oil that is being mined off shore is mainly produced by the diatoms in the ocean diatoms are a kind of algae theyre also called phytoplankton and majority of them exist in unicellular forms
5437753 its this algae that is contributing to the oil depot in the marine environment
5437754 algal mass production will not conflict with food security at the same time an integrated setup can be done in such a way that the carbon dioxide as a product of aerobic decomposition can be utilized to enhance the growth of the algal species
5437755 at the same time since the alga is also a rich source of proteins and carbohydrates upon extraction of oil the algae can still be utilized as food for livestock or fish
5437756 whats different now is that there are these alternative technologies such as hybrids and fuel cells some are in the marketplace some are rushing to market and others are in the pipeline
5437757 there werent really any brand new technologies that promised significant or permanent reductions in fuel consumption auto manufacturers only option was mainly just to build a smaller product
5437758 as gasoline prices average more than 4 a gallon and consumers worry about the weak u s economy we see june industry wide auto sales slowing further and demand for large trucks and suvs at one of the lowest levels in decades
5437759 ford has taken decisive action to respond to this accelerating shift in customer demand away from large trucks and suvs to smaller cars and crossovers
5437760 on the demand side chinese and indian consumers are eager to substitute cars for bicycles or public transportation on the supply side geopolitical conflict and scarce refining capacity are creating bottlenecks both forces are causing higher prices im afraid that high oil prices are here to stay at least for the next three to four years
5437761 have reached a tipping point there are a lot of hard numbers that show that weve actually reached a point where people are responding
5437762 when gas prices spiked in 1980 the u s was making very big gas guzzling vehicles so they were very vulnerable to competition from the japanese and european manufacturers who were used to selling fuel efficient cars in a market where gas prices were much higher so you would think the u s automakers having lived though that experience once might be guarded about letting that happen again
5437763 the trucks and suvs had fat profit margins even if the automakers saw it coming it would have been hard to shift resources to build more hybrids the u s auto industry has been struggling with a lot of problems for a long time
5437764 they felt that they could not move away from the suvs and pickups because they needed the profits from those products to cope with the other difficulties they were having labor and benefits costs were one of the largest problems
5437765 the long term challenge is to develop truly competitive hybrid or hydrogen cars we need to make the investments now so that they become available in 15 or 20 years
5437766 in the short run we need to incrementally improve fuel efficiency and help people switch to more efficient cars
5437767 i expect eventually to see hybrids offered across every manufacturers full range of models one good thing is that they are expecting a more permanent shift in consumer demand so they are actually closing down truck and suv capacity and working hard on these new technologies
5437768 dont write down gm and ford yet they will become much nimbler and smaller and they are already investing in hybrid cars they will probably manage to catch up with toyota
5437769 and the companys stock has hit an historic low but gm executives have the potential for raising cash by selling some things they could even go to the capital markets to get more money i dont see them lacking in options to deal with the cash crunch
5437770 chrysler in a way seems to be the most squeezed
5437771 i think for most investors there is too much uncertainly in these shares
5437772 when people talk about a companys core competency meaning the one thing that the company would never give up i often reach for the example of car companies and their engines
5437773 but lo and behold over the last decade there has been a steady increase in companies buying engines from other companies

5437779 hollywood and the pentagon have a long history of making movies together its a tradition that stretches back to the early days of silent films and extends right up until the present day its been a collaboration that works well for both sides hollywood producers get what they want access to billions of dollars worth of military hardware and equipment tanks jet fighters nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers and the military gets what it wants films that portray the military in a positive light films that help the services in their recruiting efforts

5437931 sa invete ca e nevoie doar de cateva secunde ca sa deschizi o rana adanca in persoana pe care o iubesti si ca e nevoie de multi ani ca sa vindeci rana

5437942 i call it the scribble factor on the normal setting definitely not on hard the player can wildly scribble across the screen mostly back and forth between enemies and fair pretty well eventually they must learn to make distinct and correct pen strokes to progress but by that point they have a move set so exciting and large it still allows for plenty of creativity the complexitys nice for advanced gamers while the scribble factors great for a young player creating a sense of wonder as the game translates his simple movements into elaborate elegant attacks pause i need to be cautious with my previous statement the biggest problem with selling ninja gaiden dragon sword to children is that it perceivably portrays violence in a positive beautiful and glamorous light violence in reality is none of these things if a parent were to take my word literally and give their child a copy of ng ds they would be expected to explain this hypocrisy to their child preferably sharing play time with them to answer questions or help beat difficult tasks or if the game negatively influences the child the parent should know when to take it away ok back to my hullabaloo the scribble factor allows for a young player to experiment and learn their own way to play the game at their own pace if they dont want to commit to intentional moves immediately they can slash and swing that little stylus to their hearts content at least until the game requires the player to take the first big step in any educational setting learning a language and how to write it ninja gaiden ds uses a unique spell system language where the player selects a spell or special move and must draw a particular character on the touch screen to perform it the systems fun quick and forgiving i love it in an educational setting i think it teaches children to quickly create complex and foreign in japanese i think apologies sometimes im vastly uneducated it also guides the player away from scribbling away at enemies and greatly rewards precise pen strokes

5437945 standing in the forests and talking to the people involved in farming cork does change ones perspective
5437946 there is something intrinsically right about drawing the cork from a bottle of fine wine it is part of the ritual and part of the magic finally companies like amorim have acted and are doing their bit to restore that magic the rest is up to us

5437984 you think apple will somehow end up dominating the industry somehow
5437985 if they reach or even surpass their goal of selling 10mm iphones by the end of the year theyll have sold as many phones as nokia sells in a week
5437986 but you could argue that apple has had most the benefits you listed in the pc world for a while now and they still have a minor share in the pc market and so itll be in the mobile market as well

5437997 i think there will be visible soa project failure in 2006 because of lack of governance governance is not optional its imperative
5437998 governance is the mechanism by which we make and enforce decisions in our own organization
5437999 soa allows for automated support and audibility of the decision making process
5438000 our departments and sectors want to govern in a way that is autonomous there is no one size fits all for soa governance one size fits all would not be a good starting place for soa in our enterprise

5438025 albert berry notes a final problem with the stolper samuelson theorem when applied to the real world he posits that activities such as factory work which are shifted from a source country such as canada to a host country such as mexico are less skill intensive than most activities in the skilled labour abundant source country and they are more skill intensive than activities in the unskilled labour abundant host country as a result the concentration of skilled jobs relative to the country norm increases in both the source and the host country decreasing the returns to unskilled labour in both cases in other words the wage differential between skilled workers and unskilled workers increases in both cases exacerbating inequality

5438089 seeing the trailers puts me off many more films than makes me want to see
5438090 we had a numbers problem obviously and that led to this latest transaction
5438091 we felt our team as it was constituted had gone as far as it could go
5438092 we like our positioning better now than we did a month and a half ago
5438093 i think weve got a very very young team i still consider myself a young player but ive got eight years under my belt in this league
5438094 so it will be fun to take some of the young guys under my wing and show them what it is to be a pro
5438095 we were trying to redefine our team first starting with high character people and second highly competitive people third is what we call high energy people
5438096 i think keyon qualifies under all of those characteristics hes a guy who can play both guard positions hes a live wire hes very very eager hes excited i think hes a great compliment and a great fit for our team and the direction were headed
5438097 im a guy who plays hard at all times im somewhat of a professional i understand my obligations with the media you have an obligation to mentor young players etc etc itll be fun ill definitely have to feel some of the guys personalities out but my personality wont change any its gotten me to this point so i wont change that
5438098 for me its a different style a different life a different game
5438099 very hard nosed player who comes to play every night
5438100 hes a talented guy a very good shooter and obviously like all young kids all 19 year old kids they always have things to work on
5438101 obviously ive seen him play over in europe ive seen him on dvd but you always want to see him go competitively against somebody close up you want to compare him to the other guys in the draft compare him to the other player in the us
5438102 this was a really good group a very good group today
5438103 these guys really got after it they competed thats what you are looking for guys that really get after it and compete especially after they get a little bit tired these guys were very very good in that regard
5438104 probably has to play because of his weight and his frame has to play small forward but he is going to get bigger
5438105 hes very young and very talented hes a long guy who can shoot the ball the thing that surprised me about him is he didnt back down lots of times when you get a guy that young and thin they will back down to contact and he didnt
5438106 i just wanted to show i am physical that i like to work hard that i like to get out there and i am a very versatile player
5438107 hes very very skilled hes a big kid hes gonna get stronger the challenge there is to improve athletically thats no secret but he competes well enough he is going to end up a good nba player
5438108 hes about 6 9 and very very talented i think he is going to be somebody who has a nba skill right away in that he is going to be able to score
5438109 the knock on me is i dont play hard and i am not a tough player
5438110 i didnt know he could shoot that well or he had an exceptional day
5438111 strong kid and tough and he competed hard had a very good day today
5438112 i have set my face like flint and i know i will not be put to shame

5438116 for the back hill where well be holding the concert the capacity will be 15 000 but we probably wont fill up the entire space
5438117 we definitely did continue communicating with councillors and we dont want to forget about them
5438118 we dont know that fort henry will be available in the future
5438119 im willing to spend money to make sure students are safe
5438120 there are ways of doing it that will definitely not impact the financial accessibility of the event
5438121 seek out less expensive ingredients at the store such as seasonal foods or those on sale
5438122 an exciting menu doesnt mean that each recipe has to be difficult expensive or time consuming
5438123 your menu can consist of five simple hors doeuvres as long as each recipe has a different flavor temperature or texture your guests wont be bored
5438124 if the world hates you keep in mind that it hated me first if you belonged to the world it would love you as its own as it is you do not belong to the world but i have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you
5438125 before long the world will not see me anymore but you will see me because i live you also will live
5438126 thanks for the note nick ill see if i can remedy that love the toons btw
5438127 there are many things we can take out of the game
5438128 when your best players set the tone for how you do things thats what makes a team special garnett pierce allen those guys dont take possessions off they dont take practices off they set the tone for everything and that makes everyones job a whole lot easier and thats a model we had it obviously when we made those two runs to the finals
5438129 theyre our rivals but you respect teams that play hard every single night
5438130 and what happens is its contagious even when they restrict the minutes of their starters garnett pierce allen those guys are on their second unit about guarding about sharing the ball and they do it thats why theyre a fun team to watch everyones bought in everyones been committed all five guys are on a string they guard they share the ball they take good shots everyone does their role and thats why they have the best record in the nba
5438131 we need to try to find a way of playing the same way on the road as at home
5438132 on the road its that much more difficult but we have to be that much more determined and persistent to try to impose our will on the game
5438133 i always like giving guys an opportunity a second chance
5438134 so far hes done very well hes been here every day all week
5438135 it is fun but it is a little nerve wracking
5438136 the seven and six have started to distance themselves a little bit and now the closest race in the whole conference is really between eight nine and 10 and eight nine and 10 we have coming up these next few games
5438137 this is one of our bigger weeks if you just look at opponents and the amount of games left
5438138 this trip is not going to determine our season either way
5438139 i think the organization felt that they needed to move in a different direction and thats their prerogative
5438140 i think that getting devin harris is going to help them in the future
5438141 everything in life presents different challenges this is one of those things where its a rebuilding process a lot of young guys on this team a lot of talented young guys on this team who need experience and could use some experience
5438142 ive been in just about every playoff situation big games here and there big matchups of course on the defensive end a lot of improvements can be made here and its a new challenge being on the ground floor
5438143 of course we are still friends just because we disagree over this

5438175 so parents and teachers need to revise their thoughts about this
5438176 because if your mom or your teacher thinks you cant do math that can have a big impact on your math self concept
5438177 boys did a teeny bit better in some states and girls did a teeny bit better in others
5438178 but when you average them all you essentially get no difference
5438179 but we need to motivate teachers to do so by including those items on the tests
5438180 so youre dipping farther down into the distribution of female talent which brings down the average score
5438181 that may be the explanation for the results rather than girls arent as good as math

5438187 what do i know now that i wish id known going into my americorps service
5438188 because of the high rate of deployment of soldiers from fort hood a lot of the traditional places weve gone to look for blood donors have dried up because of the global war on terror
5438189 we used to collect from fort hood but many of them are now fighting overseas
5438190 it goes to iraq or afghanistan and is the only way civilians can give blood to our servicemen and women
5438191 we can give the gift of life in our community any time but not to the military
5438192 the good thing about this drive is when people donate blood its going to our american heroes in iraq and afghanistan
5438193 blood will help on the battlefield and thats something we could never do if we werent able to put blood forward it helps keep our soldiers alive
5438194 its something easy for our soldiers to eat anywhere and is high in protein ive talked to many war veterans who say peanut butter was a meal for them if they could get it we can never send enough peanut butter

5438199 i was aiming for 2012 but this was a huge surprise
5438200 i started out ski racing but i was progressing very quickly in archery and thought that this was a sport i could get somewhere in so i had to give up ski racing
5438201 archery requires a lot of financial sacrifice too and my parents have been hugely supportive so have my friends they know what i have to do and give up to accomplish my goals
5438202 i figure its 90 per cent mental and 10 per cent physical
5438203 at that level everyone across the line has the physical ability to shoot strong but the mental ability is what separates the group im shooting six hours a day everyday of the week working on my mental skills and mental plan its about pushing yourself to the limit
5438204 im still a young shooter so i have absolutely no expectations on how im going to do if i go in there and come in last place but i shot well then ill walk away happy
5438205 beijing hosted test events for every sport last year and the canadian archers who went said it made no difference to them
5438206 its more hyped up than anything and if it affects me it affects everybody so its not a big deal
5438207 i think its going to be a great olympics and im proud to be a part of it
5438208 the persons case of 1929 is important because it marks the moment when canadians could no longer exclude women from universities professions or politics
5438209 it is amazing to see how far we have come and learn about what women before us had to go through
5438210 although a significant volume of undiscovered technically recoverable oil and natural gas resources is added in the outer continental shelf offshore areas access case conversion of those resources to production would require both time and money in addition the average field size in the pacific and atlantic regions tends to be smaller than the average in the gulf of mexico implying that a significant portion of the additional resource would not be economically attractive to develop at the reference case prices
5438211 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
5438212 the white house said it was against requiring u s oil products to stay at home
5438213 why would habeneck stop just for a pinch of snuff
5438214 this is great music if you are in the mood to listen to it its just that i am never in the mood to listen to it
5438215 but it will be very competitive everyone is very close maybe four or five seconds separating first from last
5438216 i think well do pretty well if everything comes together a lot of boats will show up on the race course and you never know what the weather conditions will be like

5438219 the bush administration has been quite aggressive in going after terrorists leaving little room for candidates to suggest stronger tactics
5438220 to do that theyre going to need support b2b business protocols one whether is whether its rosetta net edi web services or whatever file transfer method you want to use to exchange messages and data with external internal business partners
5438221 in some cases you have pure play b2b vendors but in many cases were talking about vendors who really didnt start out their business in b2b but have merely added b2b capabilities to that technology
5438222 but from a b2b perspective we dont have an industry standard that provides a high level of reliability for web services
5438223 were still waiting for web service reliability standards or one of these high quality of reliability standards to be approved by some standards committee widely adopted by all the vendors and then be made available to be deployed by companies
5438224 and thats going to be a bellwether event when that happens and then well see web services in the b2b context to be deployed very widely

5438239 im going to spend a lot of time with my family see some old friends
5438240 its nice to be back its nice to be home and see all my family and the people ive missed
5438241 i remember when he left in october he came home for r and r then
5438242 so this time ive been hugging him the whole time because im not going to have that feeling this time when he goes again
5438243 its been a blast it feels more like home at the house theres kids coming in and out
5438244 theyre still in and out even when hes not here but not like theyve been this week its nice and i hate when he leaves
5438245 ive been back in alaska since december of 2006 and i leave next month for another year in iraq
5438246 its been nice now i dont want to go back i actually got to see all my friends this time so its been pretty good
5438247 trinidad and tobago would seek economic integration by 2011 and political integration by 2013 with any or all of the nine members of the organisation of east caribbean states
5438248 nobody even knew this was under discussion its exactly the sort of process which will ensure that the scheme doesnt work policy announced from the top to a cynical population without even being properly thought out
5438249 looking for all intents and purposes like hes giving the people of trinidad and tobago a great big meggie
5438250 if the meg means that he was only kicksing about there not being a dengue outbreak or that trinbagonians deserve a big meggie for thinking they deserve a minister of health who actually has a clue
5438251 in the absence of tourist offices where a cuban citizen can arrange in cuban pesos an excursion in his own country private resourcefulness has addressed this market niche
5438252 its definitely a much needed step in the right direction in terms of providing much needed leadership to our teams and reducing the amount of administrative work our coaches have to do
5438253 its in keeping with the recommendations put forth in the review
5438254 the university is saying that full time coaching is important
5438255 the list of duties i received was pretty close to what i had been doing previously
5438256 i think theres going to be a significant change in pat traceys role
5438257 this means that all of both his and my efforts will be solely for the good of the football program

5438268 it has a chance based on potential to be our best class ever
5438269 i think a good number of our rookies will make an impact right away
5438270 the top six or seven are all really good prospects
5438271 were faster were more athletic were more skillful and were deeper
5438272 whitecaps women head coach bob birada speaks very highly of her
5438273 he said shes one of the best tacklers hes ever seen shes everything weve wanted in a defender
5438274 we might have been competitive without them but without a challenging environment in practice and someone on your heels challenging you and trying to take your spot every day it is way too easy to get comfortable and ultimately complacent
5438275 this class ensures that this wont happen because each of the recruits is good enough to do exactly that challenge the veterans and threaten to take their spot day after day
5438276 he brings good size to the position and i was impressed with his ability to change the speed of his set once he saw how we played
5438277 i look forward to having dan rosenbaum and dakin as our two setters as a combo they will give us one of the best quarterbacking situations in the country
5438278 we definitely got some great kids some who may be able to contribute in year one and some who may be stars of the future
5438279 he is reputed to be one of the best running backs coming out of alberta this year
5438280 youre not necessarily looking for the best players all of the time youre looking for the right fits
5438281 we have more talent than weve ever had but we dont have the experience
5438282 he started as a checking centre then got named assistant captain then got moved to the first line
5438283 hes sort of a kid who didnt start playing basketball seriously until a couple years ago
5438284 probably until this year nobody had really heard about him hes just a big strong active kid
5438285 i feel that this group of players even with their youth can bring queens a level of consistent success that has often eluded the womens program
5438286 shes a good setter she takes the ball with a nice high contact and places the ball across the offensive positions along the net very well
5438287 all new recruits contribute to the varsity team because each of the three development teams have players who will play for the varsity team in the future
5438288 his understanding of the game is a special talent at his age which makes him a versatile player with a lot of potential
5438289 i really felt i could get the best education in canada
5438290 throughout junior i played against the opponents top line and on the penalty kill its kind of an unsung hero kind of role but if you want to win youve got to be respectable defensively
5438291 scott kenway is going to be a very good player i compare him to jon lawrance last year hes a two way player that in the right setting can produce more than hes used to im actually thinking of putting scott on the first or second line throwing him to the wolves and seeing what he can do
5438292 academics and the rugby program i also know beth barz and she is a great coach
5438293 her leadership dedication and tenacity on the field will fit into our team and system seamlessly susans game sense is her best feature she can spin the ball wide which is valuable in rugby since it creates space in which to attack she also reads the play well and puts her teammates into space defensively she can be counted on to make the big tackle when necessary

5438425 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5438426 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5438427 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5438428 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5438429 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5438503 this new book is a worthy successor to lane kenworthys much acclaimed egalitarian capitalism combining academic rigor with a reader friendly style he explores how we might reconcile what many consider incompatible goals more employment and greater equality drawing on systematic and empirically rich analyses kenworthy argues against any simplistic policy formula the book makes especially lucrative reading when in the latter half it identifies the key ingredients of a win win strategy jobs with equality is destined to generate debate all the while that it affirms lane kenworthys status as a leading scholar of social inequality
5438504 on the premise that high employment is essential to the realization of egalitarian goals in the contemporary era this important book explores how social policies and institutional arrangements in advanced capitalist societies have affected employment growth over the last three decades kenworthy synthesizes existing literature and presents new empirical findings based on original cross national data and measurements his most important contribution is to explore multiple determinants of employment performance and interactions among these determinants in systematic fashion very sensibly the analysis yields policy recommendations that are specific by institutional context for students of comparative political economy the particular questions that kenworthy addresses are now settled for some time to come
5438505 the question is can egalitarian institutions and policies be coupled with employment growth

5438540 we are doing everything we can to try and keep the gorillas safe and ensure there is not a repeat of last months slaughter
5438541 we must not forget the rangers who face constant threats from poachers and the illegal charcoal trade in virunga to protect this endangered species for all of us

5438548 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
5438549 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
5438550 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies

5438905 it was not an absolutely decisive factor whether georgians were trained by americans or not
5438906 what happened was due to the political decision of georgian authorities and not the performance on the ground

5438911 a major problem in interpreting evidence on the distribution of income is the need to distinguish two basically different kinds of inequality temporary short run differences in income and differences in long run income status consider two societies that have the same distribution of annual income in one there is great mobility and change so that the position of particular families in the income hierarchy varies widely from year to year in the other there is great rigidity so that each family stays in the same position year after year clearly in any meaningful sense the second would be the more unequal society

5438944 yesus sebagai putra allah tetapi hidup dalam segala hal menurut syariat taurat
5438945 kaum nazarene hidup menurut hukum yahudi tetapi mereka menerima paulus sebagai rasul bagi bangsa bangsa non yahudi mereka berbicara dalam bahasa aramaic dan hidup menurut hukum yahudi tetapi mereka menerima kelahiran yesus dari seorang perawan dan menerima kerasulan paulus
5438946 mencobai allah dengan meletakkan pada tengkuk murid murid yang berasal dari non israel itu suatu kuk yang tidak dapat dipikul baik oleh nenek moyang yahudi israel kita maupun oleh kita sendiri
5438947 oleh kasih karunia tuhan yesus kristus kita akan beroleh keselamatan sama seperti mereka yang berasal dari non israel juga
5438948 ulama ulama islam sepakat bahwa tokoh terpenting dalam agama nasrani sejak semula perkembangannya yang ajarannya menyeleweng dari nabi isa adalah paulus
5438949 seperti juga paulus saudara kita yang kekasih telah menulis kepadamu menurut hikmat yang dikaruniakan kepadanya hal itu dibuatnya dalam semua suratnya apabila ia berbicara tentang perkara perkara ini dalam surat suratnya itu ada hal hal yang sukar difahami sehingga orang orang yang tidak memahaminya dan yang tidak teguh imannya memutarbalikkannya menjadi kebinasaan mereka sendiri sama seperti yang juga mereka buat dengan tulisan tulisan yang lain
5438950 tetapi setelah contoh contoh dari zaman kuno tokoh2 perjanjian lama marilah kita lihat para pemimpin yang hidup dekat dengan masa kita
5438951 paulus oleh teladan yang ditunjukkannya dengan telah membayar harga bagi ketaatannya kepada tuhan
5438952 aku tidak sebanding dengan apa yang telah diperbuat petrus dan paulus mereka adalah rasul rasul dan aku adalah hamba pelayanan sekarang akulah murid pertama mereka
5438953 namun demikian belum pernah aku lihat dan aku dengar terjadi dari antara kalian di mana paulus yang terberkati itu pernah melayani di tengah tengahmu seperti yang dinyatakannya dalam permulaan suratnya sebab paulusmembanggakan kalian di antara semua gereja tuhan sebagai satu satunya yang waktu itu mengenal allah ketika kami sendiri belum mengenal nya
5438954 ia yusuf mengambil maria sebagai isterinya tetapi tidak bersetubuh dengan dia maria sampai ia melahirkan anaknya laki laki dan yusuf menamakan dia yesus
5438955 allah kita yesus kristus dikandung oleh maria sesuai dengan rencana allah dari keturunan daud itu benar tapi dari roh kudus
5438956 inilah dia yang telah datang dengan air dan darah yaitu yesus kristus
5438957 1 yohanes 5 6 yang berarti bahwa yesus datang ke dunia sebagai manusia sejati tapi bukan sebagai hasil hubungan seksual
5438958 cerinthus mengajarkan bahwa allah bukan pencipta dunia melainkan kekuatan yang memancar keluar dari nya lah yang menciptakan dunia dan bahwa kristus dilahirkan secara wajar dari hubungan yusuf dan maria yang pada saat pembabtisan kristus sejati turun kepada yesus dan meninggalkan dia ketika penyaliban
5438959 masih kuingat dengan baik bagaimana mar polikarpus duduk mengajar kuingat kotbah kotbah yang disampaikannya kepada orang banyak dan bagaimana dijelaskannya hubungannya dengan rasul yohanes dan murid murid kristus yang lain bagaimana dihafalkan olehnya sabda sabdanya dan bagaimana pula ia mendengarkan dari rasul rasul itu mengenai tuhan kita mengenai mukjizat mukjizat dan pengajaran pengajarannya yang telah diterima dari kesaksian dari saksi saksi yang telah menyaksikan dengan mata kepala mereka sendiri mengenai firman allah yang hidup itu
5438960 surat pertama yohanes sebagai sebuah buku atau risalah di mana sang rasul mendeklarasikan kepada seluruh dunia penolakkannya kepada ajaran cerinthus dan gnostik
5438961 ia adalah kristus tidak hanya oleh air tetapi oleh air dan darah
5438962 we are seeing evidence of ss 21 missiles in south ossetia
5438963 but let me be clear if it rolled in after august 6th it needs to roll out
5438964 that would be in keeping with the russian commitment on withdrawal
5438965 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5438966 the only forces that are permitted to remain under the ceasefire agreement are the forces that were in there at the august 6th timeframe
5438967 were seeing them solidify their positions in south ossetia and abkhazia
5438968 i cant say whether they are actually moving people out right now or not but we do expect them to start moving out we expect them to move out slowly so this may take some time
5438969 when we received news of the first two ss 21 russian missile launchers into georgian territory
5438970 we are seeing evidence of ss 21 missiles in south ossetia
5438971 moments later a second car bomber came and wanted to detonate his bombs police identified him and opened fire on him
5438972 showed their hostility to the freedom of the afghan people
5438973 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5438974 it is the boards complaint that there were agreements in relation to both these transfers that enabled third parties to acquire the ability materially to influence the clubs policies and or the performance of its teams
5438975 the club regrets the fact that they fell foul of the fa premier league regulations but the new owners of the club now want to focus on matters on the pitch and remaining in the premier league
5438976 sometime yesterday but ah the post would killer so spro
5438977 speaking of pure taste experiences that have nothing at all in any way to do with rank status mongering
5438978 isnt there just a bit of rod lazar in you
5438979 we have to get behind him and support him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team you want your own fans to be behind him
5438980 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover every player needs to feel wanted i think he is settled in his own mind he has given a lot in the first two games
5438981 i think the booing on saturday was down more to the fact he didnt pass when he should and it was only a small section another section were calling his name
5438982 this is massive for arsenal you look around at centre forwards and players like adebayor are at a premium thats why they are so valuable he can do everything hes great in the air fast and strong if he had left you would have had to question the way things were going the message it would have sent out would have been awful
5438983 im absolutely delighted i think its excellent news fans give their heart and soul to football
5438984 they spend an awful lot of what they earn on football so inevitably if a player is hinting about leaving the club that creates an adverse reaction we see it in every football club when ever anybody publicly says they are considering moving somewhere else
5438985 i wouldnt ever dream of booing a player in a red and white shirt its cutting off your nose to spite your face but i understand that some people feel strongly about it it wont last im sure he score a lot of goals and i think hell have the overwhelming backing of the vast majority of arsenal fans
5438986 31 i have been playing for 14 years and i have the same motivation and will to win as i had when i was 17

5438994 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
5438995 he needs to start talking more about how he works across party lines

5439020 by the end of the day if the weather cooperates we can probably get all of our tourists out of there
5439021 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5439022 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5439023 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5439024 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5439025 its a change in mindset and i think if the message is something thats very well understood and very comprehensive itll start people thinking and having more kids

5439050 in certain cases broad based middleware vendors they either bought or built bam
5439051 a true straight through process there was no forking no rules processing you went straight from step one to step ten you acted on the same data but you had no specific transfer of information from step to step there was a hard wired sequence of steps

5439058 right now were being held hostage to saudi sheiks and thugs and tyrants like venezuelan president hugo chavez and iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad because we dont have the options its like fighting a fight with one hand tied behind your back
5439059 so the debate started way back in 1977 i think that was the first time i came to congress and testified on that issue
5439060 we knew right from the outset that it was going to be a big fight
5439061 there was this enormous pressure to settle for whatever we had to settle for to get the larger alaska lands act taken care of

5439085 the principle of mega power policy is to lower power tariffs and bring relief to consumers how will the end consumer benefit by giving these benefits to captive power projects the power ministry is driving this case
5439086 we believe that big power generation capacity of any ownership should be encouraged because there is a power shortage in the country
5439087 it will help in bringing more power to the market as there is no openly traded power in the market there is a demand supply gap if you dont make investing in the power sector attractive such investments will go elsewhere
5439088 this revised policy will only lead to inequalities in the captive power generation space

5439093 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money

5439102 and that statement is we want cheap cigarettes and high tuition
5439103 i think you have to live within your means right now the budget is about priorities

5439109 the goal is to keep buyers from straying by offering say an elite status with special perks that they must qualify for each year
5439110 what weve found is that people can be bought for a cookie

5439116 by the next ge general election 5 years will have passed cyber years are like dog years one year in cyberspace equals to 7 years in real life
5439117 thats the pace at which things change so 5 years times 7 means 35 years in the real world
5439118 there you are simple as that ive just made our first non political video
5439119 some things are obviously alright factual footage documentaries recordings of live events but i think some things should still be off limits for instance if you made a political commercial so that its purely made up material partisan stuff footage distorted to create a slanted impression
5439120 the overall thrust of all these changes is to liberalise our society to widen space for expression and participation we encourage more citizens to engage in debate to participate in building our shared future
5439121 we will progressively open up our system even more if you compare today with 5 years ago 10 years ago its much more open today
5439122 people who lived 10 000 years ago were much more like neanderthals than we are like those people
5439123 how we move sugars around and how we burn them has really changed a lot

5439125 so in some sense science has become the proverbial sacred cow if you dare challenge its assertions theories speculations or musings you are dismissed as a religious zealot thats the height of arrogance
5439126 unwittingly or perhaps intentionally the scientist and this author is a case in point inflames the dialogue with such assertions that the chimpanzee is our nearest cousin again that statement is unproved and unprovable
5439127 trevor in the beginning of this election there were disagreements between mitt romney and mccain it was a very long and tough time they were trying to have the same job and we decided that mccain should be president and mitt romney can help him get the job mitt romney will be the vice president

5439129 older people especially those who rely on retirement income are some of the worst affected furthermore people relying on the basic state pension which will only rise in line with government inflation figures may feel the pinch even more inflation is sometimes called the hidden risk because it quietly chips away at the buying power of the pound in our pockets but its hard to disguise a chip when it becomes a chunk
5439130 for one in five people the buying power of the pound in their pockets is being eroded at over twice this rate
5439131 the over 55s are facing enormous change in their lives and many may be apprehensive about their retirement
5439132 its great news that many people can look forward to financial and social freedom in later life but of course the more money they have coming in from pensions and savings the more enjoyable retirement will be
5439133 we want to bring the tremendous quality of independently published titles which generally arent produced in audio to the hundreds of thousands of people who experience literature through listening
5439134 we believe the program will not only expand the depth of choice for consumers of audiobooks but also introduce book lovers to new and emerging writers
5439135 this collaborative initiative seeks to increase the publics awareness of the crucial and creative work put forth by independent presses
5439136 it seems to me that the screen is even better than to the 7130
5439137 im not sure if it is but it looks to be a little sharper
5439138 i like the feel of it a little more than the 7130 i did have the extended battery on the 7130 which added a lot of weight too
5439139 im sure therell be some lingering exclusives ill want to play on the 360 like banjo kazooie 3 but ill get a 360 for that eventually and theyll be much cheaper then too
5439140 he said im a pretty confident guy i think youll get through when he said that i was pretty convinced id get through now im off to the semifinal and hopefully the final the day after

5439146 we looked at toronto and in ottawa and thought something like that could do well in kingston
5439147 thats why were going to an area thats less than 100 000 people
5439148 we dont see it as a place that bell or cogeco have entered the market we dont see any of them offering a service for free
5439149 weve got companies like microsoft coca cola and honda that are paying to advertise
5439150 we get revenue per subscriber and thats based on the page you see when you get ready to access the network the page after you login and the banner advertising while youre surfing the internet
5439151 its pretty sweet but well probably keep our own internet because its more reliable
5439152 some of those public networks can mess with your computer but itll be nice to use if our internet ever goes out
5439153 it a great service in terms of increasing the quality of life for students close to campus
5439154 if the system works and its profitable for the company then it will expand for more students
5439155 can the fan cause a tornado to form in the house
5439156 and lack of acknowledgement of these differences that is particularly troubling troubling to some anyways this blind spot spills over into the church and into how we do theology
5439157 as i began to speak the holy spirit came down on them just as on us at the beginning then i remembered the word of the lord how he said john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit therefore if god gave them the same gift that he also gave to us when we believed on the lord jesus christ how could i possibly hinder god

5439161 the biggies can score very easily over small indian start ups i am not sure if an indian start up can match tech prowess capabilities of a google or a facebook who may have millions of dollars just to invest in technology amp product engineering i personally feel that indian companies do not have the capabilities might or mind set to compete in offerings that are purely tech led

5439165 whether its a technical recession or not is not all that relevant its clearly the case that for a variety of reasons families are facing hardship
5439166 it is true that the home building and autos sectors have been hammered
5439167 but outside those sectors the economy is not just healthy but downright strong
5439168 you can look at everything mccain is doing through the lens of making sure american workers have a job on which they can build the foundation of their family and their personal goals

5439335 man we did create from a quintessence of clay the noble quran 23 12
5439336 then we placed him as a drop of sperm in a place of rest firmly fixed the noble quran 23 13
5439337 then we made the sperm into a clot of congealed blood then of that clot we made a foetus lump then we made out of that lump bones and clothed the bones with flesh then we developed out of it another creature
5439338 was he not a drop of sperm emitted in lowly form
5439339 then did he become a leech like clot then did god make and fashion him in due proportion
5439340 and of him he made two sexes male and female
5439341 in whatever form he wills does he put thee together

5439352 customer and integration are two words not usually put together but i think its the right time because of enabling technologies coming around

5439362 trying to solve the same problems over and over again by using new levels of technology in a way thats just a shell game in effect moving the standardization issue from one place to another

5439464 no holiness is not passed from one item to another from touching
5439465 if you touch a dead person and become ceremonially impure and then brush up against one of these things will it become unclean
5439466 you temple priests and this nation have contaminated your ceremonies and offerings to me because of your sins and imperfections

5439508 it is of course impossible to give you any definite instructions in regard to this movement

5439524 get out of the race just before summer so you can spend some time with the family at the beach
5439525 this is the time for a tested proven professional to lead our country
5439526 i think most americans do what the democrats did in their primary which is they look at the person and say who can be the right leader at a particular point in time and they make that decision without regard to gender or race or faith
5439527 i think both of these guys are professional politicians they get it
5439528 you get caught up in the primary and theres always emotions but a lot of that i think was more with the staffs than the candidates themselves
5439529 the reason you pick romney is you want a very solid competent debater a good governing partner someone wholl do what you say and someone who can communicate on economics
5439530 this is not in peoples heads this is reality people are hurting across the country

5439533 in other words nintendo might end up not even paying all that much in the end and causing the other company even more legal fees

5439541 o processo est muito inflamado neste momento para arriscar algum palpite
5439542 isso vai depender do que o musharraf vai perceber dos pr ximos passos neste processo que eventualmente levaria a seu impeachment se ele se sentir amea ado e n o puder contar com o apoio que tinha nos segmentos mais importantes das for as armadas eventualmente pode solicitar asilo a algum pa s
5439543 talvez uma diminui o da vontade nacional de enfrentar as for as tribais localizadas na fronteira com o afeganist o considerado foco de insurg ncia
5439544 thompson favors a constitutional amendment that bars judges from legalizing gay marriage
5439545 you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female it is an abomination

5439569 well heres how you should feel act if you really want to be equal to us
5439570 can you be an equal and a minority at the same time
5439571 well you cant have it both ways and if you really wanted to be like us you would seek to act more like xyz
5439572 it is not for us the dominate white majority to decide how the african american community resolves this issue sure we can have preferences or opinions but at the end of the day it is not our debate to resolve
5439573 you might be a conservative and a republican but you are definitely not ignorant and clueless
5439574 but we do now grant them the same inalienable rights under the letter of the law why are they still bitching
5439575 we can respect an ethnic groups need to embrace its heritage and still grant them equal inalienable rights as american citizens

5439591 the award winning public relations corporate communications and that features one on one interviews with journalists from the mainstream media and newsmakers discussing how emerging social media platforms are changing the way organizations communicate and the way people consume media and information
5439592 the most powerful arbiter of consumer tastes in the computer world today
5439593 ipressrooms visible media platform helps organizations extend the reach of their pr and marketing campaigns using the latest new media services integrated into one powerful online dashboard
5439594 this has been two camps posturing and positioning so far doing everything from a distance away from the dividing line
5439595 now with this move ea has basically said were not going to go forward as outsiders you need to let us into the tent to see whats in the pipeline
5439596 im real proud of the team and the results we delivered in light of the environment
5439597 all things considered the quality of the second quarter earnings was good
5439598 we think its consumers buying in bulk at some of the wholesale discount places to get lower unit costs on their food
5439599 we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions
5439600 this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all the diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5439601 we now have evidence that these pfrs are pervasive in the environment and may exist in higher concentrations than most organic pollutants
5439602 safe or safety means that there is reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use
5439603 complete certainty of absolute harmlessness is scientifically impossible to establish
5439604 supports fdas position that data we have reviewed up until this time support the safety of the currently permitted uses of bpa in food contact material
5439605 the most up to date analysis on the safety of bisphenol a in the world
5439606 the ntp language was some concern and people tended to focus on the word concern without realizing or really thinking through that theres a qualifier up front some
5439607 at a minimum would decide to reduce the reference dose
5439608 we have long since lost faith in fdas ability to be an impartial authority on fdas safety time and again fda has sided with special interests instead of the public interest on this chemical
5439609 if its a way to delay any decision on bpa its really frustrating
5439610 with bisphenol a we already know so much about it its not likely that anyones going to do an experiment tomorrow that will render everything that we know today wrong
5439611 canada really took the lead and said this is what the precautionary principle looks like
5439612 it will be interesting to see how it plays out
5439613 if you dig into the details of the science you find that theyre really quite similar canada ntp europe none of them found those studies to be really compelling none found them to be really suitable for making any kind of real conclusion
5439614 at this time fda is not recommending that anyone discontinue using products that contain bpa while we continue our risk assessment process however concerned consumers should know that several alternatives to polycarbonate baby bottles exist including glass baby bottles
5439615 draft assessment of bisphenol a for use in food contact applications
5439616 the storms not a concern it just doesnt look like its going to do a lot of damage
5439617 ea is saying we want to pay less take two is saying they want more the important thing is that they are talking
5439618 remains confident that antitrust issues will not prevent or delay a transaction
5439619 trinidad and tobago would seek economic integration by 2011 and political integration by 2013 with any or all of the nine members of the organisation of east caribbean states
5439620 nobody even knew this was under discussion its exactly the sort of process which will ensure that the scheme doesnt work policy announced from the top to a cynical population without even being properly thought out
5439621 looking for all intents and purposes like hes giving the people of trinidad and tobago a great big meggie
5439622 if the meg means that he was only kicksing about there not being a dengue outbreak or that trinbagonians deserve a big meggie for thinking they deserve a minister of health who actually has a clue
5439623 in the absence of tourist offices where a cuban citizen can arrange in cuban pesos an excursion in his own country private resourcefulness has addressed this market niche
5439624 when this requirement came up we had to figure out how do we make this happen quickly
5439625 we had to get the georgian troops back and sustain what we have going in iraq and afghanistan
5439626 in the 36 hours from notification to when we started flying missions it all came together
5439627 it was a total teamwork effort from a planning perspective
5439628 it was also a great team effort on the part of aircrew members maintainers and loaders
5439629 i think we had about 36 to 48 hours to plan this
5439630 we got wind of the mission and began working closely with our contacts at u s european command
5439631 we wanted the missions to be fast visible and effective
5439632 in this case in a two day effort there was hardly any impact on sustainment operations or deployments in iraq afghanistan or elsewhere
5439633 had it been a longer term operation over time there would be some degradation but that would not happen to troops in contact
5439634 to my mind the real beauty of it was our young men and women who maintain and launch and load and fly these airplanes that they were able to respond and make this move happen
5439635 they took a chance because thats what they were called to do and they did a phenomenal job
5439636 the aim of the campaign is to express that individual action on a mass scale can help change our planet for the better furthermore it cements the connection between energy usage and climate change showing that we as broader community can address the biggest threat our planet has ever faced

5439642 can you help our company get to the next level
5439643 let me get this straight all it took to cool down the eastern sussex housing market was the worst plunge in the housing sector in 30 years
5439644 while i think sussex county council has failed to plan its growth
5439645 overdevelopment is in the eye of the beholder while i think sussex county council has failed to plan its growth i still get around fine all year round the only place i ever get caught in a traffic jam is above the canal
5439646 one issue is the network involving thurman adams in the senate dale dukes on the sussex county council and rich collins of the positive growth alliance
5439647 i know thats not exactly what you said but you left the distinction blurred
5439648 if sussex county council passed a permanent moratorium on growth tomorrow all that would happen is prices would skyrocket and id make the same amount of money selling fewer houses
5439649 we have allowed our government to change from providing the basic services that we all need to using our money to create social welfare programs
5439650 to go back to my original point dave is saying
5439651 the only place i ever get caught in a traffic jam is above the canal
5439652 houses are long term purchases people dont flip every 2 years or so
5439653 are you attributing that traffic to growth or to tourism
5439654 most of the business during the boom was from investors and flippers and in an environment of rapidly ascending prices the same thing would happen
5439655 truth be told as alan greenspan points out there are thousands of factors that influence an economy that makes it far too complex for a managed economy to succeed world history has proven that many times over but some folks just arent interested in learning

5439831 if for example it would turn out that there is an optimum friction between single hairs for pleasant touch the molecular composition of hair care products can be optimized to achieve this friction
5439832 those invisible to the eye changes have a great impact on how the ingredients in the products affect the hair
5439833 a lot of this is based on this fundamental understanding of hairs underlying structure and properties
5439834 fundamentally understanding the hair structure is really important in terms of developing products that really deliver

5439905 now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha
5439906 when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby
5439907 these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep
5439908 then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me

5439910 hi uh i was doing some research about a planet in our solar system that blew up it was supposed to be roughly 2 to 300 000 years ago this is still sketchy information but according
5439911 ah well the asteroids are presumed in some models to be the remains of a planet that blew up
5439912 well its between mars and jupiter but i strongly doubt that
5439913 there are very good reasons for doubting that there ever was a planet there the primary reason is that we have pieces of the asteroid belt as meteorites when you subject then to an array of very sophisticated analysis and some not so sophisticated one of the first things that you see is that they were never pieces of a big planet many of them are in what is called a pristine or primordial condition they have never been exposed to heat they have never differentiated their minerals are in a primitive state compared to an advanced process state that occurs on a planet like the earth so its kind of hard to imagine how you build a world out of stuff that doesnt carry the signature of a world
5439914 but but dont go away there is a planet in the solar system which has been destroyed but its still there
5439915 and i believe strongly that a lot of the information that has come to us in mythological form and a lot of the current information coming to us through channel form that keeps talking in this ambiguous terminology about a world destroyed is trying to tell us about venus which didnt use to be environmentally the way it is now
5439916 i was reading an article that said venus used to have an atmosphere
5439917 so wake up earth because we may be on the same course as we speak right
5439918 unless we do certain things which i think we are going to do because we have an enormous grace period we now know enough and the rate of advance of what we know is going to accelerate that i think we will definitely be able to take control of our environmental destiny
5439919 i now postulate that they were a violent and destructive species that could not come to grips with their own rational faculty or their fear of death gort and his associates blew planet v to smithereens
