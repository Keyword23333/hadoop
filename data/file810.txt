8100019 principais problemas da economia portuguesa s o internos diz o fmi
8100020 a crise internacional n o a principal causa para o ritmo de crescimento lento que portugal ir continuar a apresentar neste ano e no pr ximo ao contr rio do que tem vindo a ser defendido pelo governo a garantia dada pelo fmi
8100021 fmi garante que principais problemas da economia portuguesa s o dom sticos
8100022 n o h contradi o nenhuma entre o relat rio do fmi e o que o governo diz sobre o abrandamento este ano da economia
8100023 o crescimento abrandar provavelmente em 2008 para cerca de 1 25 por cento e para cerca de 1 00 por cento em 2009 por influ ncia do fraco crescimento dos pa ses parceiros da turbul ncia financeira internacional e da subida do pre o das mercadorias
8100024 n o h mais refer ncia nenhuma no relat rio sobre este abrandamento de curto prazo agora repare todos os pontos que o fmi refere s o externos a contradi o portanto inventada
8100025 o governo tem se queixado de quest es conjunturais externas para explicar o abrandamento este ano da economia o pr prio texto da capa refere a quebra de curto prazo
8100026 o fmi refere se a quest es estruturais que por defini o explicam comportamentos num horizonte temporal largo e n o de apenas um ano internas
8100027 a deteriora o do ambiente econ mico global est a obstaculizar a retoma portuguesa mas os problemas fundamentais condicionando a economia do pa s s o de natureza dom stica elevados d fices externo e p blico endividamento muito alto das fam lias das empresas e do estado e um substancial desn vel em mat ria de competitividade
8100028 assim o fmi considera que apesar de haver problemas conjunturais externos a afectar portugal s o os problemas estruturais internos que mais est o a limitar o crescimento da economia o governo por seu lado tem salientado no seu discurso que os problemas estruturais internos est o a ser resolvidos pelas pol ticas postas em pr tica e que s o os problemas conjunturais externos o principal entrave ao crescimento da economia estamos agora melhor preparados para enfrentar a crise tem sido a frase mais utilizada pelos membros do governo foi aqui quando escrevi o artigo que encontrei a contradi o e ao citar aquela frase do relat rio referi igualmente a exist ncia de problemas conjunturais externos ao contr rio do que diz o leitor admito que em quest es de an lise de discurso pol tico outras interpreta es sejam poss veis porventura at mais correctas do que a minha mas gostava de deixar claro que procuro n o inventar quando escrevo os meus artigos coisa que o leitor de forma injusta rapidamente concluiu

8100052 serving fresh healthy food over three quarters of our patrons eat here two to three times a week
8100053 an equal number of people eat outside at lunch and dinner people just want fresh air now
8100054 the lights the waterfall the night sky people watching and of course the food service and wine are what make larkins patio so popular
8100055 dinner on a nice night seems to go on forever with guests coming in for dessert and drinks and watching the stars
8100056 if you want to see a spectacular sunset you are going to love this the view is huge and with the smell of the salt air you can just feel the beach and the relaxation the minute you sink into a chair
8100057 the boathouse attracts diners boaters of all ages the common denominator is that they are an easy informal kind of group that likes great food served with a great view
8100058 tom lived in a tin building with cables attached to stumps
8100059 when the rivers water rose it wouldnt wash his home away
8100060 when i woke up i could see there were others who had joined us on the sandbar
8100061 suppose for example youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom would you vote
8100062 sometimes youd be chasing things that were popular but by the time youd create something in that vein that was worthy and it went through the cycle and actually was released it would be two years later and it would be unpopular
8100063 the record was all about the feeling of relaxation and completeness that i get from being out in the natural areas around here
8100064 the surrounding area is really beautiful its not anything of a rush up here
8100065 it makes you want to write a more relaxing type of music
8100066 theres really nothing i dont have right here in travelers rest
8100067 a wine bar serving great food the food demand has become almost bigger than the call for wine it kind of happened we were a little surprised at how big the restaurant got so quickly
8100068 my wife gretchen had always wanted to own a wine store and here was her chance with this location
8100069 they hired three chefs from johnson and wales university formerly in charleston and made a team effort to develop the menu starting out with 13 items
8100070 this helps me adjust to what the market wants quicker than someone who does not understand about giving the people what they want
8100071 our customers would notice if the pitchers looked marred they get a lot of use in the summer
8100072 we have a lot of tourists here and trying to find places in towns where you are not familiar with streets sometimes makes it hard so what better way for people to locate you than to use your location as the name
8100073 and i am personally known as the blini queen since i cannot get away from their potato pancakes
8100074 we work hard to make it an experience that we would enjoy if dining here
8100075 we may serve our wines in plastic but they still taste fantastic
8100076 at first i thought about something simple for family cookouts
8100077 but then it occurred to me that there are probably a lot of people who would love to have access to a parcel of land like this
8100078 the hot tub was the only thing i wasnt sure about investing in right away
8100079 my husband and i were in need of a break
8100080 we wanted something close by and different i stumbled on hideaway havens website and it turned out to be exactly what we needed i would go there every weekend if i could
8100081 we were planning a trip to the mountains when we learned about hideaway haven on the internet
8100082 my wife and i own a retail business so we werent interested in doing a lot the seclusion was perfect
8100083 more people come to the race than live in the county during those few days
8100084 we get probably fifteen thousand people from out of state up and down the eastern seaboard
8100085 we work very closely with the chamber of commerce the fine arts center in camden the historic society the camden jaycees and the camden junior welfare league
8100086 we will have a whole week of events prior to the race we want to have a festival to celebrate the 75th
8100087 it started in the 1700s there were two gentlemen who were riding home from church and could see another church and they jumped everything in their path this happened in ireland
8100088 steeple chasing is horseracing over fences its just like any other horse race except the surface is grass and not dirt
8100089 its more challenging because its on grass and the distance is longer modern steeplechase racing is a circuit
8100090 the circuit starts in florida in march and ends here in november
8100091 it was the warm climate and sandy turf of this area that started it all its a desirable training area
8100092 it was a one day trip on the train people would come and spend the winters
8100093 the springdale race course was created in the 1920s by two gentlemen that came to camden to pursue equine and canine sporting
8100094 for one thing it was the first full length steeplechase track in the country where all the jumps are visible from the viewing area
8100095 the carolina cup race has such a force its one fabulous lawn party its a wonderful tailgating atmosphere people come dressed to the nines
8100096 the garments the ladies wear are picked out months in advance and called their cup outfits its a very big deal
8100097 they get passed down in generations fought over in divorces
8100098 she remembers going being carried on her daddys shoulders she went to college and watched the race from the college area now shes grown and has a parking spot of her own
8100099 we also receive over 100 busses from universities from south carolina north carolina and virginia
8100100 the basic feeling is the same for a person attending today as a person attending in 1930 in 1930 it was primarily a family gathering where you got in an old wooden sided station wagon and packed a picnic and enjoyed the racing
8100101 the only changes are the amount of people and the way they attend fabulous cars fashion and corporate sponsorships are all new
8100102 the adoption of the race by college fans has grown so large we built an area for them
8100103 the legacy lives on especially with the young people and thats whats so amazing the continued growth
8100104 were not a timeshare not a rental we are hassle free boating
8100105 we like to say they own the ocean not the boat
8100106 we do the maintenance the insurance the taxes and the clean up members only have to show up and buy fuel
8100107 many of our members are previous boat owners they are so happy to be done with it well even help people sell their boats
8100108 i had a sailboat in charleston city marina and a powerboat in dry dock neither was used enough to justify the cost
8100109 and we take members out in the water if they are new to boating we dont want anyone going out until they are ready
8100110 you just have to plan ahead thats the only disadvantage you dont have the flexibility of having your own boat
8100111 we offer reciprocity with other freedom boat clubs four times a year
8100112 i replace boats every two years and add boats as the membership grows
8100113 its an opportunity to relax and have a good time with your friends and family
8100114 out in the water youre in an entirely different place
8100115 i asked the guy dredging where they came from he said from the bottom of the lakes 30 to 40 feet down
8100116 its a very significant find to recover wood in such quantity and size its extremely rare
8100117 please help me find a way to not whip this crackies ass i just got this job american idol
8100118 i think about opening a hot curling iron in your asshole
8100119 its never a good idea for a large man to wear his waist measurement on a belt buckle
8100120 i remember looking up and seeing the clock read 00 00 00 and it looked funny to me i was used to seeing 00 10 05 or 00 12 29 to mark the time that i had lost to the winner people were cheering and screaming and this time it read 00 00 00 that meant i had won the race it was an amazing feeling ill never forget that moment as long as i live
8100121 that is a great tool for me but its also an incredible view from the top paris mountain is also a favorite ride for me in the greenville area
8100122 i entered my first bike race when i was 8 years old
8100123 it was an awesome experience and i won my first race i won all of the races i entered for the first couple years
8100124 i love the one day classics style of racing and paris roubaix is the hardest most brutal of the one day classics you have to ride more than 150 miles over some of the roughest roads you will ever see in your life the weather is usually pretty miserable so it challenges you on all fronts i was second in 2005 and thats the highest ever for an american things were looking great this year until i suffered a mechanical breakdown that took me out of the race i will be there to try to win it again next year
8100125 at the end of the day i just love racing my bicycle its just fun for me to ride this is what i want to do sure there are times when its so hard you arent having that much fun there are times when you dont want to go for a ride or finish the race but at the end of the day i love this sport
8100126 from mid may to mid august at 6a m seven days a week about 12 to 15 volunteers patrol the beach looking for the signs of loggerhead activity
8100127 loggerhead turtles make large tracks in the sand that look like tractor tire treads
8100128 we now have about 100 feet of glorious beach at high tide
8100129 prior to the renourishment the sea crept right up to the maritime forest
8100130 its a futile effort and a huge cost to taxpayers for a just a temporary fix
8100131 sure we cant stop the erosion from taking place altogether
8100132 we dont have the traffic issues we dont have the doubling of our population from summer to winter
8100133 among so many benefits we have great weather conveniences that do not exist in more heavily populated areas and crime is not a problem there are few better places to raise a family
8100134 from a personal perspective the love of the land the lifestyle the opportunity to have work and family so close by to key operations were exceptional considerations
8100135 it is certain that there was no part of the arrangement more critical than the real estate program
8100136 maybe we can bring some more recognition to just what a beautiful part of america this is
8100137 and hopefully we can help with tourism with some investment into the state time will tell how much we can really do but were looking forward to it
8100138 utilization of the riverfront for recreational use a choice area for future residential development pedestrian oriented ground floor commercial uses and a permanent park area
8100139 as long as they know how to do it so they can teach their children
8100140 i remember sitting by her on the floor where she weaved
8100141 and everything that fell from her lap i kinda picked it up and tried to imitate her of course my basket looked nothing like hers mine just looked like a cat had gotten into a ball of yarn
8100142 there were only a few of us out there at the time but we didnt have to worry about traffic
8100143 i hope it will not change unless it changes for the better more children become interested in doing the baskets as well as learning about the history
8100144 i was raised in arkansas but im related to half the people in georgetown
8100145 do you mind if we talk while im at the sink
8100146 i thought id fix us some lunch i hope you like shrimp and beer
8100147 i started commercial fishin with my uncle richard jordan back in 1984
8100148 back then the whole family done it richards dead now but he used to own two shrimp boats a 75 foot trawler named the capt andrew and a 45 footer named the miss peggy
8100149 from winyah bay in georgetown wed set out at about 3 30 in the mornin and dependin on the tides get to the open ocean within one and a half to two hours then wed set our nets and start draggin
8100150 on an average wed catch 1 200 maybe 1 500 pounds of shrimp a day thats 17 to 20 baskets full of shrimp and other fish that had to be sorted while we were on our knees
8100151 of course shrimpins where we made the most money but back then there were a lot of things we could do to make a little extra money
8100152 we used to sell caviar and we made good money catchin sturgeon then 12 to 15 years ago the state put sturgeon on an endangered list and closed down the season on them they said theyd reopen the season in seven years but they never did
8100153 when tidal surges caused by hurricanes flush shrimp out into the ocean you can catch maybe 30 to 40 baskets a day
8100154 but even heavy rains can do the same thing thats because shrimp cant live in fresh water if you get heavy rains theyll swim back out to sea
8100155 you cant scrap or drag net like you used to could
8100156 scrappin is slang for the times when you cant locate the shrimp but youre desperate to catch somethin in some areas though the state has limited scrappin because they said we were catchin too many turtles it aint like you could help it but thats the way it goes
8100157 guys dont get into commercial fishin to get rich they do it because theyre born into fishin families who do it and love bein out in the ocean all they ask is to be able to support their families while doin it shrimpin used to be a good life but not anymore theres no future in it for the next generation
8100158 ive been sellin shrimp from the corner of highway 17 and the north causeway in pawleys island since 1994 and i only sell shrimp that ive bought from friends and family
8100159 i could sell imported and frozen shrimp people ask me why i dont all the time but i aint going to do that
8100160 i sell the freshest shrimp you can buy because i only buy the last drag of the day otherwise the shrimp would have to be dipped in sulfides to preserve it and i dont want to sell shrimp with chemicals on it
8100161 a shrimp holds up pretty good for about a week if its headed as soon as its netted
8100162 but if its heads on it has to be really fresh
8100163 its the perfect place to introduce children to hunting there is a controlled atmosphere everyone is safety conscious
8100164 its fast and easier to shoot a round without walking the course
8100165 i looked out of my window and there was my dog with my 2 000 ham

8100173 na primeira p gina no canto superior direito aparece uma fotografia em primeiro plano um jovem cigano e em segundo plano um senhor de bon e barba acontece que logo no in cio do texto se refere que entre os indiv duos que nunca saem do bairro h um homem de barba e bon que vende prata para preparar a hero na fumada por coincid ncia infeliz a pessoa fotografada deputado da assembleia da junta de freguesia membro de v rias associa es locais com um trabalho comunit rio reconhecido esteve com a equipa de reportagem a pedido desta para estabelecer contactos a sua fotografia foi tirada sem autoriza o e relacionada com o texto atr s referido pode levar para quem n o o conhecer a conota es pouco agrad veis dando de barato que foi um acaso revela ainda assim pouco cuidado e merece da parte do jornal um esclarecimento e pedido de desculpas
8100174 todas as pessoas fotografadas deram a sua autoriza o todas as fotografias foram tiradas durante o dia pelo que nos pareceu evidente que nenhuma retrata o movimento nocturno de tr fico reportado no texto o jornal foi informado de que uma das duas pessoas retratadas na fotografia estava descontente achava que poderia haver alguma m interpreta o decidiu se telefonar s duas pessoas a pedir desculpa e republicar essa fotografia como foto da semana rubrica que sai ao s bado s na edi o porto na legenda torna se a explicar que de dia o bairro do cerco do porto quase pacato e afirma se que nem esta nem as outras fotografias publicadas na reportagem representam o universo do tr fico de droga apanham momentos da vida do cerco do porto a meio da tarde h imagens dos rapazes que jogam malha junto ao ringue de uma alco lica que se passeia de garrafa na m o

8100176 n o dev amos publicar rostos de pessoas embriagadas como n o devemos publicar rostos de pessoas que consumiram outras drogas o fot grafo p s em linha sem pudor talvez porque a senhora n o s deu consentimento como posou para a fotografia
8100177 n o parece que a refer ncia sua exist ncia no texto seja ofensiva toda a gente no cerco conhece aquela senhora sabe o seu nome a sua hist ria usamos apenas um nome pr prio pr tica comum na refer ncia a pessoas que n o queremos tornar identific vel ao exterior
8100178 porque conhe o o bairro posso dizer que tamb m a fotografia dos jovens legendada com o clima de tens o tem vindo a agravar se est incorrectamente referenciada basta olhar para essa fotografia para se perceber que neste grupo n o h tens o s o jovens que t m fortes redes de sociabilidade e estavam a jogar quando aceitaram ser fotografados

8100191 uma quest o semelhante a que sucede quando se escreve o nome de radovan karad i a forma que utilizei a correcta para escrever o nome usando a vers o latina do alfabeto servo croata esta quest o n o menor uma vez que os alfabetos servo croatas tanto a vers o latina como a cir lica s o eminentemente fon ticos com cada s mbolo a ter apenas uma correspond ncia fon tica neste caso o nome a ser escrito de forma foneticamente mais pr xima do original mas no alfabeto portugu s deveria surgir semelhante a radovan karadjitch como se v o som completamente diferente o p blico tem escrito radovan karadzic da mesma forma que n o me agrada ver os nomes portugueses a serem mudados no estrangeiro o til em dur o barroso frequentemente omitido por exemplo tamb m gosto que os nomes estrangeiros sejam correctamente escritos apesar de isto ser frequentemente pac fico em muitos casos pergunto se existe alguma conven o definida para os restantes um nome deve ser pronunciado correctamente por quem l uma not cia na televis o ou na r dio mas tamb m por quem a l num jornal e caso se opte por n o se transcrever o nome de forma fon tica causaria problemas com nomes mais simples como os ango sax nicos ou franc fonos o ideal seria utilizar a simbologia original para os escrever sempre que poss vel claro que isto n o seria o caso de alfabetos exclusivamente cir licos mas a j temos os exemplos russos que podem ser seguidos
8100192 sou daqueles que aprovaram genericamente as altera es introduzidas na ltima renova o gr fica que o jornal fez
8100193 o jornal impresso com um tipo de letra demasiado pequeno nem todos os leitores ser o jovens adultos com olhos de lince muitos usam culos e outros j ultrapassaram a idade de m xima acuidade visual consegue se ler certo mas exige maior esfor o visual e melhor ilumina o tanto mais que o jornal impresso a cinzento e n o a preto sobre um papel de cor pardacenta curioso notar que a direc o reservou para o seu editorial o privil gio de um tipo maior como que a premiar quem o queira ler mais ou menos na mesma altura em que o p blico renovou o seu grafismo o expresso tamb m o fez mas teve o bom senso de aumentar ligeiramente o tamanho dos seus tipos para facilitar a leitura e portanto a vida aos seus leitores
8100194 as fotografias n o t m legendas que descrevam situem datem e nomeiam o que nelas se representa ao contr rio do que se poderia esperar de um jornal objectivo o p blico reproduz fotografias acompanhadas de frases que s o uma esp cie de subt tulos ep grafes lemas e reminders chamadas n o se d ao trabalho de referir a data aproximada o local e o contexto tem que se ler o artigo para se fazer uma ideia do que se mostra habituei me ao exemplo dos jornais ingleses do times magazine do antigo lexpress franc s e parece me que eles t m a f rmula adequada podem fazer todos os coment rios s imagens mas nunca deixam de identificar o seu conte do sem esquecer a data e o local mesmo que sejam fotos de arquivo ao fim e ao cabo as fotos num jornal di rio devem ser documentos de actualidade e n o meramente elementos decorativos ainda por cima as legendas s o colocadas a morder o assunto num caso muito recente a tocar na cara do fotografado sou totalmente contra esta moda de colocar a legenda dentro da fotografia respeitem a legibilidade
8100195 as legendas das fotografias e muitos subt tulos espalhados pelo jornal s o impressos em tons desbotados de vermelho ou laranja diminuindo assim a clareza e legibilidade que deviam ser valores acima de qualquer outro no projecto gr fico
8100196 o jornal usa frequentemente grandes fotografias a quatro ou cinco colunas costumam colocar essas fotos no centro de duas p ginas abertas a 3 de agosto era rafael nadal nas p gs 2 3 a 4 uma m dica ou uma enfermeira ou uma auxiliar enfim nas p gs 6 7 mais adiante um not vel do ps nas p gs 16 17 ser por desinteresse ou sadismo do grafista mas quase sempre nestas grandes fotos a cara do retratado cai em cima da dobra das folhas e a cabe a aparece dividida algum respeito pela identidade do retratado deveria merecer outro tratamento

8100240 estado gastou 485 milh es em rede de comunica es que valia um quinto

8100242 a isso acrescent vamos dez por cento por ano que corresponderia ao custo de explora o
8100243 absolutamente descabido o t tulo de primeira p gina que induz propositadamente os leitores em erro
8100244 tendo por base estas declara es de almiro de oliveira o valor m ximo estimado do siresp ascenderia a 375 milh es de euros pois ao valor do investimento inicial devem somar se os custos de explora o por 15 anos 150 milh es 225 milh es o valor m nimo por sua vez quedar se ia pelos 250 milh es de euros 100 milh es 150 milh es estes s o os valores compar veis com a adjudica o efectuada ou com a anterior cujo acto foi considerado nulo o estudo de 2001 como natural n o contabilizou os custos financeiros mas mesmo assim a compara o poss vel pois nas parcerias p blico privadas sempre calculado o valor actualizado l quido do contrato ou seja o valor do contrato sem custos de natureza financeira e quais foram esses valores o da adjudica o produto de proposta reformulada cifrou se em 291 3 milh es de euros e o da adjudica o declarada nula em 340 7 milh es de euros ou seja uma e outra situam se abaixo do valor calculado como valor m ximo estimado no relat rio de 2001
8100245 manifesta m f e inten o de imprimir cunho sensacionalista not cia mesmo que custa da honra e dignidade de terceiros
8100246 o que aquele t tulo faz de forma acintosa comparar dois custos diferentes de um lado apenas as despesas de investimento e do outro estas acrescidas de despesas de explora o a parte mais onerosa do sistema e de todos os custos de natureza financeira como comparar o pre o de um autom vel pago a pronto pagamento para ficar guardado religiosamente na garagem durante 15 anos sem qualquer utiliza o com o do mesmo autom vel adquirido atrav s de empr stimo e com todas as despesas inclu das por 15 anos tais como combust vel manuten o seguros portagens etc
8100247 a seu pedido uma exposi o escrita em que referi u os v rios argumentos que a levaram a pensar que os dois valores podiam ser compar veis apesar de ter consci ncia de que se tratavam de realidades muito diferentes
8100248 o que podemos considerar que se compararam dois sistemas com servi os diferentes e por isso custos tamb m diferenciados assim as contas de daniel sanches podem fazer sentido numa ptica de custo total para o estado almiro de oliveira refere se aos custos que eram apenas imputados entidade que devia gerir o siresp de acordo com o modelo por si proposto sem contabilizar os encargos de utiliza o que seriam suportados pelas v rias entidades p blicas utilizadoras do sistema incorporando estes numa ptica de apuramento de custos totais para o estado e tomando como correctos os valores propostos por daniel sanches a propor o de um para cinco deixa de facto de fazer sentido por falta de rigor
8100249 ele n o foi ouvido nem na minha ptica deveria ter sido o que estava aqui em causa n o era a sua actua o enquanto ministro alvo de v rias not cias em mar o abril e meses seguintes de 2005 nessa altura daniel sanches foi contactado para cima de cinco vezes e nunca quis falar a sua actua o como ministro n o de todo a not cia a sua participa o no siresp apenas contexto desta not cia por isso at estranho que daniel sanches se queixe desta not cia quando o siresp um caso que sigo h tr s anos e ele j foi referenciado mais directamente noutros artigos
8100250 a estrita quest o dos custos no entanto redutora em todo este caso do siresp que o p blico tem investigado o que est no centro deste tema a decis o econ mica de se ter optado por um modelo t cnico e financeiro em vez de outro e a forma como foi feita a adjudica o por um governo que estava j em gest o ap s as elei es e por um ministro o pr prio daniel sanches que tinha exercido fun es no grupo a quem adjudicou esse sistema
8100251 desde h mais de tr s anos que sou objecto das mais torpes insinua es por parte da jornalista que assina esta not cia pelo que estou convicto de que aquele t tulo n o foi inocente mas antes deliberadamente manipulado para p r em causa os intervenientes no processo de adjudica o pelo qual o signat rio tamb m foi respons vel
8100252 considero as insultuosas e at pass veis de responsabiliza o civil e criminal apenas me limitei a descrever factos talvez esses factos n o tenham sido sempre do agrado de daniel sanches mas isso nada tem a ver com o meu trabalho

8100273 era mais interessante pedir a um conjunto muito alargado e muito diverso de personalidades portuguesas que formulassem perguntas ao primeiro ministro do que entregar esse trabalho a jornalistas da casa especializados nas diferentes reas
8100274 o primeiro era conseguir que um n mero suficiente e suficientemente diversificado de personalidades acedessem ao nosso convite
8100275 essa aposta foi ganha mas implicou envolvermos na recolha das perguntas 16 jornalistas
8100276 o p blico quer registar a pergunta que gostaria de fazer ao primeiro ministro caso pudesse estar presente no plen rio da assembleia da rep blica ter de ser curta e directa embora a possa antecipar com uma breve 400 500 caracteres justifica o dos motivos que o levam a considerar como fundamental
8100277 mesmo depois de muito cortar no texto de introdu o n o consigo resumir mais sobretudo porque a quest o demasiado gen rica para dispensar o pre mbulo

8100281 parece uma evid ncia que o mundo est sem resposta para a profunda crise econ mica e social que a vem n o h medidas reformistas que travem a explos o dos pre os a escassez dos recursos e a escalada de protestos a proletariza o das classes m dias vai agravar se o recurso ao roubo fraude fuga dos compromissos com o cr dito vai aumentar j n o temos o recurso da guerra nem dos regimes duros para mascarar as crises h o risco s rio de o estado baquear de o poder cair na rua e de o caos se instalar portugal o elo mais fraco da ue nestas circunst ncias as oposi es n o v o perder nenhuma oportunidade para criticar o governo por tudo o que acontecer e se as coisas azedarem o pm n o pode esperar como j se percebeu a solidariedade do pr num mundo globalizado numa europa enfraquecida o que acha que pode prometer ainda aos portugueses
8100282 entendo que se trata de um injustific vel e inexplicado atentado aos meus direitos no limite aceitaria que me dissessem que a minha pergunta estava longa que havia respostas a mais tudo menos reduzi la sua express o mais simples que me faz passar por um idiota

8100289 optou se por deixar apenas a pergunta que pareceu pertinente
8100290 em condi es ideais o p blico deveria ter consultado de novo as 21 personalidades cujos textos tiveram de ser adaptados mas as condi es em que se processa o fecho de jornal di rio n o o permitiriam nunca sobretudo porque muitas das contribui es chegaram nos muito tarde

8100317 these houses are significant because they are among the few remaining examples of this type of architecture they represent a way of life in which seasonal movement between the low country and the seashore evolved
8100318 the homes then were built so that you could come in off the beach rinse your feet off and walk around barefoot
8100319 our new house has just the right roof line and we used as many native materials as possible
8100320 our overall objective was to build a new old pawleys house in the end it reflects the almost seamless transition between the outdoors and the indoors
8100321 they want a home that has character but that still emulates a casual lifestyle has an open floor plan and nice views the historic homes on pawleys have that low pitched roof and porches that take advantage of the prevailing breezes
8100322 in the hands of an insensitive architect oftentimes the new home is a big box that is three stories tall but a sensitive designer will look at whats been done in the past
8100323 you see a detail in that door knob you see something new every time you study them observation is key
8100324 this home best exemplifies pawleys architecture it has the pawleys island seal porches that are an extension of the interior living space and are as much of a gathering area as inside rooms
8100325 the houses are simple with a double pitched or what i call a witchs hat roof a loft space shuttered windows controlled by interesting pulley mechanisms and double hung operable windows for the nice breezes
8100326 pawleys island does not have an architectural review board but there are guidelines and people who build here are expected to respect those
8100327 its so simple we have about 1 800 square feet and a large loft area that we call the dormitory because it has several beds up there some are building now for size and appearance many are way overdone like a woman with too much makeup on that is way overdressed for the beach but what pawleys island is known for is simple homes where families can enjoy simple pleasures i doubt better times have been had anywhere and our home is just a simple beach house with simple furnishings
8100328 our goal is to entertain people with a great product and great service and do whatever it takes to make someone happy
8100329 our restaurant has a comfortable casual feel and we want our customers to enjoy good food and have a good time
8100330 our guests know that everything we do starts with quality
8100331 we serve real food for real people it is elegant yet affordable we are a neighborhood caf that people find comfortable and welcoming and our entire management team is dedicated to a daily focus on hospitality
8100332 from the first picture i saw of them when i was 3 years old and the first time i saw them on television i thought they were amazing
8100333 i just keep pinching myself to make sure its real
8100334 i just feel so fortunate to be able to do what i love to do
8100335 she had that passion she really enjoyed the whole atmosphere
8100336 for a little while in high school she thought about the law we teased her about becoming the worlds first dancing lawyer
8100337 its such a prestigious group with such a rich history
8100338 as i got more into dancing i realized how hard they worked that it wasnt all glitz and glamour its one of the hardest dance jobs there is
8100339 i felt like i was always supposed to be a rockette
8100340 i had spent my whole life wanting to be a rockette i had gotten things id wanted before but not something i spent my whole life chasing
8100341 the entire stage is a grid thats how we stay precisely together its very mathematical
8100342 its such a hard job because there is no freedom in the choreography it is so exact if one girls pinkie is pointed in a certain direction everyones pinkie has to be pointed in the same direction
8100343 you have an off season and then you have to start preparing your body
8100344 we were all on pins and needles because we knew 40 would be cut so it was the whole process of waiting over again we auditioned again and waited to hear if we had made the cut
8100345 this life is what i do i never wanted to do anything else and never would i leave this land
8100346 the land was my home and my father nourished the kettle by encouraging me to be a constant reader from the time i knew what a book was
8100347 m s sanders inspired all of his children to read and learn
8100348 he drilled the love of reading books into all of us younguns
8100349 i guess i started writing also because i wanted to leave a legacy to my nieces and nephews as a way to tell them about their heritage and the history of this place
8100350 i am afraid this generation of children and young adults has ambitions other than the family farm but i want them to have their history
8100351 dori sanders country cooking recipes and stories from the family farm stand
8100352 i said to my wife well we wont be seeing that guy again
8100353 your residential buyers want the long range views and the elevation all the things that you expect with mountain living
8100354 but those views and the elevation can make the golf so rough that youre playing a game that has to be manufactured by the architect thats if he can do it but here the golf course was already here in the land tom fazio just simply moved a little dirt here and there built some greens and put his wonderful touch on it it really was impressive to watch him and his team bring it out
8100355 i feel we need to do this right coming out of the gates
8100356 i never thought at this juncture in my life i would be the curator of a museum
8100357 as a culture i think its important that these skills be preserved
8100358 were all so things oriented we all want to preserve the object but i think theres value in preserving the skills that created the object as well
8100359 this has just never been done before taking a trade and saying that this is worthy of the same study commitment and scholarship as any of a variety of other pursuits that are the foundations for academic credentials
8100360 i have long felt that in private higher education the future belongs to those institutions that can define a special niche for themselves that can identify something that they do better than anyone else
8100361 in some ways the college of the building arts is sort of the ultimate in niche marketing
8100362 i worked for a cabinetmaker for a little while and just fell in love with it whereas everything else i hated waking up for in the morning
8100363 he thinks its a wonderful opportunity because he puts that value into higher education and he also understands that this is what i want to be doing and this is what i love doing
8100364 in the building trades its often much easier to find a job if youre well educated and i believe i will be well educated
8100365 fortunately through this program we also gain contact to craftsmen throughout the united states and even in other countries in a way that will provide us opportunities to seek jobs with well established craftsmen
8100366 an undertaking to the court that from certain specified termination dates until the hearing of the proceedings or further order they will keep or cause global ambition to keep full and complete records including candidate details dates placement details fees generated costs and profits in respect of all transactions involving the placement by any of the defendants of candidates for recruitment with pricewaterhousecoopers canada and kpmg in the cayman islands russia and bermuda
8100367 instilled in me at an early age that it takes hard work knowing how to treat employees well giving customers great service and never getting out of the day to day running of the business
8100368 i knew the moment we walked in that we could bring the place back to life and make it a home for fine dining
8100369 took off from day one and has not slowed down
8100370 for many years chocolate has been considered a candy in the u s and a delicacy in europe
8100371 because tea is growing and being harvested every 10 to 15 days you have to blend it to maintain a constant quality
8100372 it is only served in the larger cities in the us and not many of them
8100373 the customer is the most important thing and the best way to keep them coming back for more is through constant innovation finding the best ingredients possible and a providing a restful environment in which to dine
8100374 not enticed by the big city restaurants where he would be more of an overseer than chef
8100375 was a very practical cook but also an excellent one
8100376 desserts like your grandmother used to make not always the most glamorous to look at but the best thing youve tasted in quite a while
8100377 as we turned onto the road leading to the house mama and aunt sally wondered if the jonquils their mother had planted would be blooming
8100378 as the house came into view so did the jonquils mama and aunt sally squealed
8100379 we joked that if we were younger wed move it to marion county and restore it
8100380 they had a mutual interest in doing this and their excitement was evident they are not faint hearted so no matter what obstacles they met they were determined to finish
8100381 one of our customers told us that none of the table got what they ordered but they loved everything they got
8100382 looking back to our first days in business and how little we knew it is hard for me to believe how far we have come
8100383 some people are driving less or staying home but when we heard that some folks were passing up a six pack while watching a football game we drew the line you shouldnt have to sacrifice beer or barbecue for gas
8100384 this embrace of the culture of participation goes back a long way
8100385 if you look at the roots of yahoo it was two guys sitting in a stanford dorm room manually organizing what was out there on the web
8100386 the flickr deal was huge because it gave yahoo instant street cred with bloggers
8100387 we started publishing rss feeds around the middle of 2003 with a plan to take rss to the masses we just had a few thousand users but once we got the myyahoo aggregator out the door things just exploded
8100388 now were talking millions and millions of users consuming content via rss on myyahoo it is the number one browser based rss reader today
8100389 one of the key things for us is to be an open platform we want to help consumers get what they want how they want it
8100390 user created content fits in a huge way theres an immense amount of content becoming available on web and the majority is user generated
8100391 theyre creating blogs uploading digital photos creating podcasts posting on message boards ultimately theres a nonstop conversation happening on the web with groups of people sharing their interests the idea is to make it real simple for this conversation to happen
8100392 when you think of the web and where things are going there are three important audiences the consumers the publishers and the advertisers
8100393 the lines are blurred these days because the consumer is now the publisher and the publisher is becoming the advertiser
8100394 as a company were helping everyone to make money from all these conversations that are happening
8100395 anyone with a blog on yahoo 360 can use ypn to publish ads the focus is to turn consumers into publishers give them the tools to express themselves and get new places to push relevant contextual ads
8100396 weve watched the podcast community grow and thats another area we are excited about
8100397 we can flickr ize anything if you think about it
8100398 the world of web 2 0 is driven by distribution all these acquisitions and products fit together in a thematic way
8100399 its very easy to do because theyre all standards based its more platform oriented and rss enabled in very interesting ways
8100400 thats a very big question obviously most of our users are coming through the browser today but that will change as the mobile devices get smarter
8100401 more people are beginning to access yahoo through mobile phones and set top boxes
8100402 were paying attention to everything thats happening in the browser world especially around firefox and ie i cant speak to specific product plans but were looking at everything
8100403 we have a top down mandate from the senior most levels of the company to be an open platform based on industry standards we dont want to be a walled garden instead we want to facilitate people to be creative on the web
8100404 i was more interested in giving kids the tools to think rather than just giving them all the answers
8100405 there was never a dull moment in bills class what i remember the most were the field trips
8100406 i remember someone brought in some baby possums once the mother had been hit by a car so we took turns taking them home over the weekend they were great fun they would spit at you and make these little noises but it was the most amazing experience
8100407 because of him and his teaching methods i ended up with excellent critical thinking skills
8100408 whatever i know about natural life ive learned from him
8100409 the more i taught the more i realized i didnt have the deep background in natural history that i needed to satisfy my students curiosities here they were going on field trips and buying binoculars and i was doing all that i could to stay one step ahead of them
8100410 four very long very cold winters following the blue jay around the university of minnesota
8100411 im on installment 333 and ive only scratched the surface
8100412 most people dont think of it as a birding mecca as they do other places in the state like huntington beach state park but i think thats because they dont take the time to look
8100413 its important to learn more about the region and the world around us so that we can understand it manage it properly and encourage and empower people to do the right thing
8100414 by now you may have gathered that conservation is the hidden message in all my teachings
8100415 the biggest misunderstanding about natural resources is that they are unlimited or that we as people have the capacity to fix anything thats broken in nature there is a tremendous capacity for healing but once a species is gone its gone forever
8100416 shes been ridin since she was 17 but she keeps to the wooded trails now the main roads are too dangerous what with speeding cars
8100417 i knew i had to do somethin with my time so i decided to make bowls i just taught myself out of my head
8100418 i use all hardwoods maples easiest to work with cherry warps and is hard to manage though its beautiful cedar makes lots of dust walnuts good pines not so good and i have to cut in the winter when the saps down or the woodll turn dark
8100419 one time at the mill i just felt something was wrong with jean so i went to where she worked i found her with her hand caught in a machine and it had already taken three fingers i grabbed her and pulled her out if i hadnt gotten there when i did it could have taken her whole arm
8100420 cost us 23 000 to flatten and clear the airfield
8100421 even a tree that size could be 150 years old
8100422 they look real healthy but are so much shorter than trees on the mainland because the dirt is so poor over here the advantage being though if we have a hurricane we dont get hardly any damage because they are so short and have long taproots into the sand
8100423 se fossi una cosa sarei un telefono se fossi unanimale sarei una tigre
8100424 that 70 percent of the artisans are women from cultures where they have no rights or if they are left on their own no way to make a living
8100425 buying something out of flemings hand since she had no place to put it in the store
8100426 this place brings together everything good in retail i learn something every day when we receive new merchandise we want everyone who comes in to have a good time feel good about their purchases and learn something about the skilled artisans who make all our goods our customers are amazed at how affordable these exquisite handmade items are and feel like they are doing a good deed since we are founded on the principle of paying the artisan a price that is fair so they can live
8100427 i was giving a presentation and they wouldnt quit asking me questions
8100428 we are continuously one of the largest orderers of baskets in the country since they are so popular in south carolina i am still amazed at the number we sell customers will come in and buy ten or twenty of them at a time
8100429 the one ingredient missing in a lot of shopping experiences we want customers to have a good time here the merchandise basically sells itself so all we can do is make sure you enjoy the process
8100430 it is fun to hunt for things by country and see how diverse you can be
8100431 we became landlords for purple martins in the late 1980s by putting up housing for them and protecting them from predators we started out using cumbersome wooden birdhouses and tried many designs learning as we went that we needed to be able to lower them with a pulley and winch system that allowed for frequent nest checks now we use large plastic supergourds which the martins love
8100432 the setting of the course and ambience was just incredible
8100433 the owners are right on target with the design and the surrounding area
8100434 what do you expect if youre only hitting a wedge in here
8100435 a great playing surface a deep emerald green that striped up with mowing just like rye grass
8100436 the putting surfaces were excellent and contained many subtle breaks not detected on the initial read
8100437 you can find a 60 000 sports car as easily as you can a van from a plumbing company
8100438 we make membership golf available to all demographics in an area where typical initiation fees can range from 10 000 to 50 000 or more
8100439 plenty of character into an essentially flat piece of pine forest
8100440 is west yorkshire averaging one ufo report every four months the ufo sightings include an incident last month
8100441 month long sci fi extravaganza available on our virgin media tv on demand servic e
8100442 its fantastic to see local folk taking an interest in ufo activity and keeping an eye on the sky
8100443 old days say you would occasionally hear about the astronauts spotting unknown objects in orbit ok this is a strange bit of news when was the last time you heard the term ufo associated with the alien footage
8100444 and personally i feel she probably hasnt done herself any favours with the article as it seems to concentrate on the more bizarre aspects of her subsequent alien visitation s and is even titled
8100445 it was like a big headlamp but not as big as a football and hovering above the rooftops i wasnt scared the ufo was there for about 10 minutes i was fascinated i always sort of believed in them and knew something was out there when i saw one it confirmed it
8100446 we used to speak in telepathy and they would immobilise me
8100447 we would get psychic messages from extra terrestrials and they would channel themselves through someones body
8100448 id had a bad relationship and thought why not ask them for help and love i was sitting on the sofa and i heard a voice say are you feeling ok i didnt know what to do it was a lovely softly spoken voice it was a nice english accent the voice asked me do you want us to play you some music i said yes i started hearing 1940s music it made me laugh i thought it was so funny either theyve got a sense of humour or they dont know what music i like
8100449 we got engaged but the aliens came between me and my fianc first of all he didnt believe in it because i was saying all these things i was lodging with him when i heard a loud bang the aliens had bumped themselves down and fallen on top of each other they were laughing and giggling about it it was so strange to see aliens on the floor thinking it was funny
8100450 he said he heard the bang and i think i believe you he called them the three amigos
8100451 an alien pulled up in a silver car it was quite early in the morning i seemed to see in my mind this alien pulling up in an expensive honda car i could see it in my mind parked up outside the house i thought i better compose myself i am going to be frightened i tried to trace them in my mind coming in the door and coming up the stairs but in a matter of two seconds it came to the bottom of my bed they looked like doctors one had a clipboard i had been suffering from cystitis at the time but i know they gave me an operation on my forehead they cut through a piece i was aware of it and sort of conscious it seemed to hurt but as soon as they had gone it went i dont know whether they were trying to make me more psychic if you have an operation on your third eye you become more psychic sometimes they put implants in people and put them up their noses to track people not for any bad reasons just to know what people are doing i think they were investigating me anyway i think they are investigating a lot of humans on the planet to see how their minds work and to change the way the world works
8100452 i was laid on the settee and fell asleep then i heard a sound at the door it just sounded like when you stand on a cats tail it was quite a scary experience i felt either a rope or a fishing line come around me it didnt hurt it was like a lasso it was wet and it touched me on the face as if id been hit with a wet fish i was going up towards the light i didnt want to go any further and gently came back down they have visited me about 30 times its fairly regular at one point it seemed to be happening all the time each experience is totally different they used to put a ray over my body to immobilise me i think it was to try to calm you down they didnt do anything sinister to me i dont tell people they are quite frightened of it i dont need to tell people i dont think they believe me thats why im telling my story to the mail to give credibility i want to get it into concrete evidence if you dont come out and say people think maybe people may say im barmy but at the moment weve got a hole in the ozone layer we are living in times that are delicately balanced i dont know what we are going to do
8100453 aliens have given me so much of themselves so much love and understanding
8100454 so this girl i used to date was telling me how great it is for her to have a gay brother which is even better than a best gay boyfriend do you have any gay relatives
8100455 the extent to which users can participate in modifying the form and content of a mediated environment in real time
8100456 there have only been three times that we havent seen dolphins
8100457 in 2001 our family purchased and developed a large tract of rural land near latta to entertain corporate clients
8100458 but when mom shared the vision of the camp with us we knew right away that god had a much greater purpose for beulah land plantation
8100459 but it was very important to us that we execute properly we knew we didnt want to create a camp that would compete with existing facilities or programs we wanted to include immediate family and we found no camp to model ourselves after in that regard so we hired an entrepreneurial coach to help us develop a plan
8100460 our objective is to put our arms around the whole family from the moment they arrive
8100461 we want them to forget for just a little while all the circumstances that surround cancer its amazing to watch how god transforms families in the short time that theyre here they tell us that they leave stronger as a family
8100462 this competition is about the private sector and ours really came through
8100463 with 17 municipalities our county geographically is the second largest in the state
8100464 our population is just under 91 000 people with half living in the suburbs and the rest living in outlying rural areas
8100465 parts of our downtown were in need of some work and the community responded
8100466 over 200 people participated and we came up with a two phase plan
8100467 the second phase in now addressing quality of life issues rather than infrastructure
8100468 love is patient love is kind and is not jealous love does not brag and is not arrogant does not act unbecomingly it does not seek its own is not provoked does not take into account a wrong suffered does not rejoice in unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things love never fails but if there are gifts of prophecy they will be done away if there are tongues they will cease if there is knowledge it will be done away
8100469 it has some pretty strong backers and a founder with a good pedigree baidu tengxun xunlei

8100488 o trabalho de selec o de imagens tende a ser feito em conjunto pelo editor da sec o e pelo editor de fotografia mas h muitas fotografias encomendadas directamente pelos editores ou conseguidas pelos jornalistas ou seja h muitos caminhos diferentes para que a foto chegue p gina

8100509 i and others have certainly questioned how keith olbermann can rip mccain on his show and then co anchor the coverage on primary nights and at the conventions olbermann says and msnbc says that he puts aside his commentary role during news events i guess viewers will have to decide whether thats a problem but its worth noting that bill oreilly and sean hannity were part of foxs coverage last night

8100512 i try to stay objective through all my work i try to do my best not to keep a political opinion because as a journalist i always try to balance it out with what is on the other side
8100513 i always press them for like if like a candidate makes an accusation about them ill have them give like their side of the story because thats important to journalism how you always get two sides theres two sides to every story
8100514 we use it the way we want to use it
8100515 mark my words saddam will develop weapons of mass destruction he will deploy them and he will use them iraq is a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction ready to use them or provide them to terrorists drug traffickers or organized criminals who travel the world among us unnoticed if we fail to respond today saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow by the knowledge that they can act with impunity some day some way i guarantee you hell use the arsenal
8100516 our purpose is clear we want to seriously diminish the threat posed by iraqs weapons of mass destruction program saddam must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms poison gas or biological weapons earlier today i ordered americas armed forces to strike military and security targets in iraq they are joined by british forces their mission is to attack iraqs nuclear chemical and biological weapons programs and its military capacity to threaten its neighbors i have no doubt today that left unchecked saddam hussein will use these terrible weapons again
8100517 saddams ability to produce and deliver weapons of mass destruction poses a grave threat to the security of the world
8100518 we must stop saddam from ever again jeopardizing the stability and the security of his neighbors with weapons of mass destruction iraq is a long way from ohio but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risk that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
8100519 saddam will use those weapons of mass destruction again as
8100520 the problem is not nuclear testing it is nuclear weapons the number of third world countries with nuclear capabilities seems to grow daily saddam husseins near success with developing a nuclear weapon should be an eye opener for us all saddam is too dangerous of a man to be given carte blanche with weapons of mass destruction
8100521 serving on the intelligence committee and seeing day after day week after week briefings on saddams weapons of mass destruction and his plans on using those weapons he cannot be allowed to have nuclear weapons its just that simple the whole world changes if saddam ever has nuclear weapons
8100522 one of the most compelling threats we in this country face today is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction threat assessments regularly warn us of the possibility that iraq may acquire or develop nuclear weapons saddams chemical and biological weapons capabilities are frightening
8100523 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process

8100542 barack obama is campaigning very hard going everywhere these days to get the vote out
8100543 weighs 25 percent more than the models selling the clothes
8100544 these blades are oversized so they can actually operate in lower wind speeds of three to four miles an hour
8100545 so even on a day like this you can feel theres a slight wind going it should be enough to get this turbine working for us
8100546 the large number of people who are going to the polls are not paying attention at this point
8100547 the parties are very different and the public is obviously still learning about both candidates
8100548 theyre going to learn a lot about both candidates over the next two weeks
8100549 we just have two competing world views and i think america is just divided
8100550 its still going to come down to old fashioned shoe leather and people willing to spend a lot of time on the telephones as well as going door to door
8100551 its very much in play and im optimistic that barack obama is going to carry hamilton county in november
8100552 we think we have the right candidate to reach across the aisle reach across the political spectrum and bring in people that may not traditionally vote in our party
8100553 youve got to figure out what the message is to those independent people in hamilton county or cuyahoga county or elsewhere
8100554 when youre surveyed when youre called up on the phone thats not something youre going to say to a stranger on the phone
8100555 when you go into a polling place it may be a different thing
8100556 the pain youre feeling is only your mind trying to re live the trauma
8100557 the initial pain was real you dont have to feel that pain any more your body is just needing to remind you that you need to be mindful of your injury dont reinjure it
8100558 breathe and let your energy flow through your body dont let it get stopped at your knees
8100559 buyers dont have enough time to go to all the shows that are out there and they dont have time to weed through every hanger in every booth

8100565 it is remarkable that this story hasnt made it into the msm which means either the msm doesnt pay attention to the roman catholic leadership or that they are covering for pelosi and her abortion extremism and by extension obamas
8100566 not too remarkable considering that barack obamas marketing arm and the main stream media are one and the same

8100599 i was fascinated by the fox news commentary after michelle obamas speech monday night the talk was personal revealing entertaining commentators come across best when theyre friendly and down to earth not pontificators and the fox crew came through they were the gang youd want to hang out with at a cocktail party you dont see a commentator near tears very often but fox news contributor juan williams an african american was moved by the portrait that the obama family had presented

8100615 kiplingers just named sacramento the 8th most livable city in america and the business journal recently named sacramento the best city in our region to do business a move from last to first this was my vision for sacramento when i first ran in 2000 and now it is reality
8100616 fargo for mayor 2000 campaign promises list and check it for these two entries 1
8100617 for any mayor the safety and security of the citizens of a city are always the highest priority and this is no different for heather fargo
8100618 the mayor will continue to strengthen resources for police and fire and in her next term will work to make service and response time more uniform across the city
8100619 additionally mayor fargo believes that a key way to stop crime from going out of control is to make sure that our young people stay busy and engaged in their community so that they arent tempted by gangs and drugs
8100620 i am sure many people want to see a debate between the candidates what do you think
8100621 i have said during this campaign that vision is something you see not what you say
8100622 its message is no less needed today than it was when it first appeared
8100623 the same collectivist fallacies are abroad and on the rise today
8100624 the immediate issues are different and so is much of the jargon
8100625 similarity of much of current english political literature to the works which destroyed the belief in western civilization in germany and created the state of mind in which naziism could become successful
8100626 few people if anybody in england would probably be ready to swallow totalitarianism whole there is scarcely a leaf out of hitlers book which somebody or other in england or america has not recommended us to take and use for our own purposes
8100627 yes i have problems with some of the things they did but many of their ideas were good
8100628 most of the works which are preparing the way for a totalitarian course in the democracies are the product of sincere idealists and often of men of considerable intellectual distinction
8100629 i want something new that makes me feel like my first again

8100651 this race is all about the future thats why we must elect barack obama as our next president because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemates and when hope replaces fear
8100652 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an
8100653 in this election at this moment in our history we know what the problems are we know that at this critical juncture we have only one shot to get it right and we know that these new times demand new thinking we believe in success we believe that everyone should have an opportunity to get ahead and with success comes a responsibility to make sure others can follow
8100654 the big difference then was that things actually happened at conventions when i was 16 years old in 1964 i was the go for for walter cronkite at the republican convention in san francisco

8100702 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people

8100776 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8100777 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8100778 i am so excited to be involved with this years visa swap event the concept of swapping clothes getting something for nothing and refreshing your wardrobe appeals to everyone
8100779 i might grow some more but i have not grown in a while
8100780 it has always been a great programs one of the topnotch and i feel i will be able to develop there
8100781 im going down there to keep developing and get better
8100782 im used to playing against older players ive done it my whole life
8100783 i heard nothing but good things about him but they left the door open so good for him
8100784 i know him i had him in a 14 year old camp
8100785 she followed me to the bathroom during a private party and well we basically got together
8100786 i think she knew who i was when she first saw me we were just staring at each other and she walked by i walked into the bathroom and she followed me in
8100787 he did all of this with approval of his hair chewing child bride
8100788 id say it happened about five minutes into the keynote speech he delivered four years ago
8100789 the dedringers are without a doubt one of austins best new bands they sound at once familiar and fresh

8100791 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8100792 those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama for president
8100793 over the years we talked to him extensively about music what he had done and what we were trying to accomplish
8100794 he offered insight and sympathy for what we had ahead of us and most importantly encouragement he put his money where his mouth was and continued to book us in his club and get together with us whenever we came through bakersfield it was an honor to be recognized and boosted by a man who was our musical hero and the times we had to spend with buck are cherished memories
8100795 people have been talking about these tapes ever since i recorded them
8100796 to me they were rough and stark and i never thought theyd see the light of day
8100797 the last of a dying breed a hard nosed iconoclast with an acoustic guitar and a college degree
8100798 these tapes are like an amazing photograph out of an old life magazine before photoshop or fancy editing tricks
8100799 what chris was doing could be harsh like coffee or whiskey but he is the most honest writer ive ever heard in my life the truth is not something chris talks about its something that he is
8100800 chris sang if i were you and i thought i was hearing john prine and steve earle rolled into one
8100801 there was such an honesty and purity to who he was he was a coalmine reclamation inspector from rural kentucky who was writing these incredible songs on the side he didnt know who to call or what to do he just came to town to play his music i dont know how i thought i could help him other than to give him some gas money to come back to town from time to time and play more songs
8100802 i didnt feel like a recording artist i was just a guy writing songs who hoped other people would record them i didnt go to nashville expecting to get a record deal i didnt think i fit in and i still dont
8100803 i was spending a lot of time with him in his hometown
8100804 its a different time and a different way of life up there but i knew that this place was where his music was coming from most of all i knew his life was going to change i wanted to get all these songs on tape literally where they were written to document where he was before anything had happened to him
8100805 the plan was to drink some beers shoot some guns and record some songs
8100806 i had been living in that trailer for 10 years and it was probably 30 years old when i moved into it
8100807 the rent was cheap and it was close to any place i wanted to go it was my home
8100808 we were three guys including chris we had two microphones and an adat machine and one of the engineers jobs was to jump up and turn off the window fan whenever we started recording chris refused to wear headphones we just tried to get songs on tape before they got away
8100809 singing into a microphone figuring out how to get a song across it all made me nervous nothing ever suited me and i was really self conscious i hadnt performed live much and i rarely sang or played a song the same way twice
8100810 theres some pretty good songs that fell by the wayside for whatever reason
8100811 it was surprising to find theres several that really stand up
8100812 my only prayer is probably the truest song on there
8100813 it most defines who i was back then i never wanted to be in the city ever in my life and im basically still that way maybe i didnt play the game like i should have but what i have done is spent a lot of time out there playing my songs i am what i am and i dont have many regrets
8100814 the guitar is banging on the microphone clothes are scraping against the guitar and rain is hammering on the roof my goal was to clean up the non musical issues that got in the way of some amazing performances
8100815 theres no compression no eq no nothing its just straight the way it was recorded and when you listen to it in your car youll swear chris is in the back seat thats the impact we wanted to get we wanted the listener to feel that they themselves were sitting in that trailer
8100816 these tapes deliver all the essential makings of chris knight
8100817 over the years hes become a little bit more sophisticated and maybe a bit more self conscious but the cool thing about not being self conscious is the raw emotion it brings its pure performance and absolute truth
8100818 i hoped these sessions would come out one day because i knew then that they were special
8100819 they have the chops to warrant the attention and high expectations theyve sparked since their debut when rodeo hits the mark with the likes of
8100820 the nurse who looked after my dad when he was in intensive care up in north york was there too and so that was pretty sweet
8100821 i wanted to make a record that was a bit deeper lyrically than my last few but at the same time still entertaining on a purely emotional level
8100822 i found a copy of her first lp in a used vinyl store after i took it home and listened to it i was flooded with memories of my childhood and quite taken with her songwriting and singing style after a while i tried to find out what happened to her after the hits but found very little info past the late 70s the actual song i wrote very quickly it seemed to write itself we recorded it maybe a day later
8100823 increasing the size of our larger cities is not a sustainable solution instead improving services and infrastructure especially public transport networks in existing medium density zones with untapped potential for future growth is where attention and resources should be focused
8100824 nation wide targets to reduce carbon emissions and waste and for water efficiency are essential measures required for both the development of new and the management of existing built infrastructure

8100826 we are relieved that the beijing organizing committee of the olympic games has sourced the jade for the olympic medals and official souvenirs from china
8100827 but there is a growing demand for burmese jade that will only increase due to the olympic promotion of jade the generals will keep using their jade profits to buy weapons and crush dissent in burma unless individuals take a stand
8100828 our mountains have disappeared and our youth are dying the generals are letting their cronies mine away our future
8100829 we urge people not to buy blood jade from burma

8100838 the data is twice as important as the card for them this is crucial for woolies as they will be able to track not just what you spend and where but just as importantly what you are not buying
8100839 unless you are spending close to the average which is a 15 000 a year then the level of reward is probably not going to warrant the additional cost of the higher annual fee and the interest rate
8100840 so you would have to be spending at least a 1000 a month to offset the higher fees associated with any reward card let alone this particular one
8100841 even though numbers have declined there are still 12 million calls its still a service people find valuable

8100855 holy pasta and authentic sauce the flying spaghetti monsters messy implications for theorizing religion
8100856 does religion require a genuine theological belief or simply a set of rituals and a community joining together as a way of signaling their cultural alliances to others
8100857 is an anti religion like flying spaghetti monsterism actually a religion
8100858 global warming earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of pirates since the 1800s

8100870 will act powerfully to defeat the purposes of the whistleblower protection act
8100871 if we find that there was retaliation we do something about it
8100872 this decision shouldnt deter people from filing whistle blower complaints because they will be investigated by the university
8100873 it just seems like such an inherent conflict of interest
8100874 what possible rationale is there for exempting the university of california from whistle blower
8100875 they are way too crowded and there are too many people
8100876 we are facing extraordinary growth whether we like it or not and to accommodate that it is important that we have child care said councilman sam liccardo
8100877 we dont like the decision but we are willing to work with the community for a year at 45 beck said
8100878 i have come up with what i hope and think is as balanced an approach to this project as possible
8100879 i am sorry that mrs beck made a poor choice from the beginning without doing her homework

8100893 key west magic brings together two people who have been hurt in the past because of this neither julie or trent look for anything that might last long julie doesnt really think much of magic prior to key west and trent but she cannot deny the magic between them reading about trent and julies pasts had me wondering about their future i fell in love with the calloway house and especially the ghost emily watching trent try and fight his demons and julie begin to believe in magic made key west magic a more than gripping story the passion and sensual feeling that runs throughout just adds to it if paranormals with a bit of a twist interest you then you really should check out key west magic not to let anything out but the epilogue has put me on the watch for the next book dealing with the light family

8100901 this june will be a pivotal moment in awakening consciousness for woman although i want to be clear on the topics that will be covered there is no doubt it will be cutting edge and offer huge breakthroughs for women and their overall development i expect it will accelerate a females development by at least ten years i mean this quite literally keep in mind that i have never truly addressed female matters exclusively believe me i will have a lot to say an exhaustive and intensive workshop is an understatement what should be on every womans mind is liberation real personal growth and freedom i have no doubt this will be a very life changing event for many and truly empowering
8100902 everyone just raves about the quality of service and the environment at the zen center
8100903 the setting environment and food are so supportive of the experience for the participants
8100904 many thanks to everyone for facilitating us in having a successful retreat
8100905 it was wonderful everyone was very helpful and respectful of our needs
8100906 we cant think of anything that could have been done to improve thanks
8100907 nn puoi pretendere troppo devi accontentarti esprimi un desiderio e vedro cosa posso fare
8100908 ma guarda te si che roba ora si inalbera pure
8100909 caro mio io mi devo dividere con tanti altri corpi mica ci sei solo tu
8100910 sei anche superba se credi di conoscere i miei pensieri
8100911 qual e quella cosa per cui varrebbe la pena desiderare
8100912 i dont go camping unless there is a full kitchen bathroom and bed at my disposal
8100913 i think we know from the beginning by looking at the numbers that we have some academically disadvantaged and challenged kids
8100914 theres no question about it but we believe we have the necessary support to allow them to be successful or they wouldnt be here
8100915 last year was the first year of the program and we saw that the kids who came into the bridge both athletes and non athletes did really well
8100916 were really trying to enhance the programs like this to help at risk students and provide that extra support
8100917 im not hung up on that obviously i will be hung up about the graduation success rate and we need to make sure that everybody that comes here will have the chance to graduate
8100918 when youre 1 11 you know you put yourself in a position where your talent pool is not as great thats just reality
8100919 we know statistically that junior college kids dont always succeed academically and thats our biggest concern
8100920 our coach knows that and our staff knows that but i think the reality is that when youre 1 11 youre looking for some immediate improvement in certain positions
8100921 the more successful we get athletically i think the larger pool well get of better athletes
8100922 you watch old nfl films and those guys played at 230 pounds
8100923 now our quarterbacks are 215 and linemen are over 300
8100924 i went to eight clinics in the past year and one of them had 900 people
8100925 thirty years ago you saw maybe one division i player a year
8100926 this spread offense is a lot different and as a quarterback its awesome
8100927 youre 5 yards back before the snap and you can see everything you get the ball and youre already in your progression you dont have to worry about dropping back
8100928 its really fun for everyone the running backs like it because they get their hands on the ball and the wide receivers really enjoy it because they know its a passing offense
8100929 we are way more wide open in the last few years because we like to get basketball players involved
8100930 weve modified and adjusted to different looks but you have to have something to hang your hat on
8100931 were an option team and that hasnt changed in 25 years i think part of what we like about what we do is the uniqueness of it its not something every school does we feel they have to prepare for us probably a little differently than the standard offenses theyre used to seeing
8100932 one week well play six defensive linemen and the next week well play two
8100933 and for the kids who arent in the game its a big problem
8100934 to unite our people and forge a clear national direction
8100935 abdullah does not have the minimal credibility needed to run the country day by day let alone to take it in the new directions we need to go in a complex world
8100936 it is time to face the music it is we who have been buried
8100937 i think abdullah should strongly consider for all our sakes to step down now
8100938 this is a second time that the malaysian people have given a clear message with the first at the general elections it is a rejection of the present leader and he must leave now
8100939 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8100940 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare

8100944 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8100945 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8100946 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8100947 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8100948 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8100949 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8100950 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8100951 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8100952 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8100953 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8100954 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8100955 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8100956 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8100957 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8100958 all you need is 200 people in the crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8100959 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8100960 we are on the same team none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8100961 barack obama is my cand and he must be our pres
8100962 you made me laugh and yes you even made me cry
8100963 money borrowed from the chinese to buy oil from the suadis
8100964 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or in it for
8100965 there are no limits to what is possible in america
8100966 he thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8100967 no wonder mccain and bush are going to be in the twin cities next week these days you cant tell them apart
8100968 i have a relatively stable job and decent income so i planned to make some investment then i realized how fast stocks and funds were falling and that bank deposits resulted only in negative interest rates and prices are rising so fast i better spend the money to make my life more comfortable
8100969 the global economic environment is bad and the china government does not have a second key project for investment like the olympics i guess economy might slow down in the following period but so long as the regulatory policies are appropriate i believe the economy will continue to improve
8100970 houses are expensive and house prices might fall further banks are tightening their mortgage policies so i might as well wait instead of buying a house now

8101004 girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8101005 our need and not just in relation to public health issues is to act on the environment while fostering positive peer pressure and social norms we have to take away the excuses

8101046 the normal political thing to do in terms of the best decision to make to win wouldve been to pick hillary clinton
8101047 it is a no brainer she got 18 million votes joe got 9 000 votes
8101048 hes a charming guy hes a celebrity but does he have the judgment and experience that comes from a life long service in one sector or another
8101049 thats what the choice for a president comes down to it doesnt come down to a choice between the abstract and the abstract it comes down to a choice between two people

8101051 i cant imagine anybody who is ready to debate joe biden
8101052 im not sure when john mccain will make his vice president announcement or who itll be

8101067 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8101068 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8101069 this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8101070 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8101071 those are reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i am supporting barack obama for president
8101072 this will not be easy progress never is but it will be impossible if we do not put a democrat back in the white house
8101073 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8101074 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president

8101077 im all for outlining acceptable behaviour but i dont see a contract as the right way
8101078 i think we underestimate the ability of kids to contribute eight year old kids are quite savvy
8101079 the fact that a child is eight and is asked to contribute to the definition of rules that they are part of is a good thing
8101080 part of a social contracting experience where kids and the teachers negotiate what rules apply in a classroom
8101081 often the origin of these rules is kids themselves its quite a different regime to what happened previously where teachers said these are the rules and you will follow them or these are the consequences
8101082 its a far more collaborative and i think fairer way its not draconian at all
8101083 thats a fairly young age to have a contract which has punitive components to it youre more likely to get somewhere with that age group if you use carrots as opposed to sticks
8101084 i would think its part of the broader trend across australian schools to make them more collaborative and democratic
8101085 we want to see a reaction which will prevent russia from repeating what they did either in georgia or in any other place and will show them the price for what already was done regarding georgia

8101102 we are investigating a matter which relates to a police officer and i guess my point at this stage is we are investigating and i think various people are speculating at what it is but weve had concerns about his behaviour and we are investigating that
8101103 we have a variety of ways we conduct investigations were comfortable with the way we are investigating that
8101104 theres a whole variety of ways we find out about officers behaving badly our ethical standards department does an outstanding job
8101105 what people need to understand is that police officers do have discretion many officers exercise that discretion in a number of ways
8101106 what we require of our officers when they do that though is that they are open and transparent
8101107 people have a right to some privacy in policing while we investigate the matter
8101108 i would imagine it would be very hard for anyone subject to these sort of things to come forward
8101109 all i can say is that nsw police force will be providing every form of support we possibly can to make the process for them as trouble free as possible
8101110 all of the lines of inquiry that have been presented to us have been explored and are being investigated
8101111 theres no loose ends being let go at this stage
8101112 i can confirm that theres no one at the school at the moment that is subject to that inquiry
8101113 at this stage were looking at 13 victims and were following up those lines of inquiry at the moment
8101114 there were three former staff member who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8101115 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8101116 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8101117 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8101118 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8101119 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8101120 were pursuing those lines of inquiry and to anticipate when charges will be laid at this stage is a little bit presumptuous
8101121 in contradiction to a 60 year assumption in archaeology weve managed to show that neanderthal stone tool technologies are no less efficient in a number of respects than homo sapiens stone tool technologies this suggests that neanderthals did not go extinct because of inferior intellect or technology
8101122 i think this study is very important in that it is helping move neanderthals out of that dark box that they have traditionally been confined to
8101123 they are not just dumb limited versions of ourselves but highly advanced very intelligent cousins different does not mean inferior

8101126 no we havent had any contact with ms hawach thats a given we dont expect contact or anything like that but the phone call my wife made to her to see how the girls were doing there was nothing there no she didnt ask to see how we fared
8101127 we always wanted that outcome for the girls to get back to their mum and they now have communication with their father as well by phone i have no regrets
8101128 we knew what we were doing originally the plan i had in place was to wait for a legal outcome but that went south it didnt work so we decided to stay back and go with a plan that was a lot riskier

8101182 in many ways the work of a critic is easy we risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment we thrive on negative criticism which is fun to write and to read but the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so but there are times when a critic truly risks something and that is in the discovery and defense of the new the world is often unkind to new talent new creations the new needs friends

8101190 yet the steps that make it possible are so simple im almost embarrassed to share them
8101191 step one lock in income streams that build your wealth faster than inflation
8101192 step two focus on income streams that will grow even bigger with time
8101193 step three look for a passive income stream that wont
8101194 ive written a brand new research report that shows you how to make each of these steps very easily this new report is called the ultimate paycheck portfolio double digit yields even in flat markets it shows you how to apply each step quickly allowing you to start collecting income checks within just a few weeks of reading this letter
8101195 heres the thing timber stocks tumbled as housing construction slowed but asian timber demand has remained massive which is a fact many hair trigger market amateurs have completely overlooked
8101196 meanwhile because of the nature of the business this company also works something like a reit the real estate trusts that get taxed at a minimal corporate level maximizing even more cash to dole out to you as a shareholder on the company
8101197 but even when demand slacks off unlike with most other businesses the timber assets just get more valuable even sitting still they can grow in value as a company asset by as much as 10 per year
8101198 can you imagine if your house your bank account the value of your car or any stocks you might own could all automatically grow 10 more valuable year after year
8101199 this plus the continuing surge in asian demand leaves this company flush with piles of cash to divide up among shareholders in the form of personal checks sent to you directly in the mail
8101200 first of all the checks were talking about are shared with only these cash paying companies shareholders and who usually owns the most shares of all in any given company
8101201 doling out cash incentives to shareholders is a great way for them to take extra cash flow out of the business at a lower tax rate when they get salaries or bonuses that money gets taxed as income
8101202 of course you get the same lower tax benefits on these payouts too
8101203 another reason cash heavy companies love to share cash with shareholders is that its a great way to reward loyal stock buyers and keep the shares stable or even rising during rough markets
8101204 its that simple the companies that can afford to give away the cash do better by doling out cash to you than by lending the cash or spending it themselves
8101205 this is one of a few companies doing this that loves to fatten up

8101247 there seems to be an almost overt hostility to cyclists not only from many motorists but more importantly from the planners and highway engineers who create the street environment
8101248 but undoubtedly the initial trigger was a pro cycling attitude from local authorities who in the past had been negative or even hostile to cycling as are some politicians in australia

8101287 instead of new ideas and innovation they offer trillion dollar tax breaks for the very rich at the expense of the middle class a deficit out of control and a government unable to help its most vulnerable citizens after hurricane katrina

8101289 instead of new ideas and innovation they offer trillion dollar tax breaks for the very rich at the expense of the middle class a deficit out of control and a government unable to help its most vulnerable citizens after hurricane katrina
8101290 instead of inspiring the world with the power of american ideals they offer war as a first resort an overstretched military justification for torture and trampling of civil liberties
8101291 from the invasion of iraq to the devastation of katrina i see arrogance abroad and incompetence at home
8101292 and i simply cannot tolerate and america simply cant afford more of the same any other time i might have given up on politics convinced that nothing would ever change but this year a new leader offers the change we need
8101293 barack obamas ideas and ideals are not tired and old they are rooted in the timeless values that define our great nation unity optimism faith
8101294 he is a leader who challenges us to put aside old divisions of party and region and race and unite around a common purpose a leader who will replace the old politics of special interest influence with fiscal responsibility and shared prosperity including freedom from the tyranny of foreign oil
8101295 a leader who as commander in chief will keep our military strong stop spending 10 billion a month in iraq start bringing our troops home responsibly and win the war against those who attacked us on 9 11
8101296 as an old navy veteran i know change isnt always easy but sometimes its necessary and this is such a time in barack obama i see judgment character courage and principle over politics and partisanship in barack obama i see the change america needs

8101301 its a team that can get you at any point so youve got to kind of be on your toes
8101302 you can never get too comfortable youve got to go out and still be aggressive you cant change your game plan too much but i think theres a point with teams like this that theyre never out of it its a tough team to pitch again
8101303 i honestly dont know how we beat him three times
8101304 hes probably the best pitcher in baseball tonight he had a good night
8101305 when doc is on the mound youve just got to scratch out a few runs and youve got a chance to win

8101316 i wasnt really thinking about it i was just trying to go out and get people out i went long in the game and at least saved a couple of guys in the bullpen
8101317 this kid is an animal you see him throw in the bullpen session and he is a strong kid and he has the same pace and concentration in the game this kid has a chance to have a good career
8101318 he changed speeds and threw three pitches for strikes his fastball his slider and curveball
8101319 his curveball is a great strikeout pitch he moved the ball around pitched to contact he did a good job
8101320 it definitely didnt start out how i wanted it to
8101321 i just feel like were finding different ways to win ballgames
8101322 were kind of spoiled by now its been like that since april
8101323 i just want to get as deep in the game as i can
8101324 give the team a chance to win and put up as many zeros as i can
8101325 the way he takes the mound sets the tone for the game
8101326 playing defense behind him when hes pounding the strike zone like that it keeps you on your toes
8101327 i felt good for the first two innings and then i just got away from my game plan
8101328 i tried to battle through it but it just didnt work out a bounce here and a bounce there and that was it
8101329 we just didnt make plays that we should have we just couldnt stop the bleeding
8101330 just hopefully well continue to win the way we are as a team and finish strong
8101331 i dont like it i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please
8101332 its happened thousands of times thats part of the game
8101333 we probably should try to stay away from him tomorrow
8101334 were having trouble scoring runs and everybody probably goes up there squeezing the sawdust out of the bats
8101335 i dont think theres any magic formula other than keep going out there and fighting the frustration we seem to be experiencing
8101336 any ball that comes at that guy is an out so you dont have to worry about that
8101337 i was able to throw a couple of two seams in to get them to hit the ball over there and thats where you want them to hit it
8101338 id rather have that any night than no balls hit to me it makes it fun they can hit to me every time thats what i think thats what youve got to think i take a lot of pride in my defense
8101339 i was like whoa he looks a lot quicker he looks faster he looks more sure of himself
8101340 as weve gone through this preseason all those things i saw in the spring im seeing now
8101341 hes just more certain about what his role is and what he should be doing and getting to that spot as quickly as possible
8101342 i think my conditioning is much better and my legs are obviously another year removed from surgery which helps
8101343 im so much more comfortable in the system just a lot of things factor into that i think im playing at a level where i havent been before
8101344 sometimes ben will be in some of our other packages where hell be a rusher were going to try to work both of them in the nickel like we did a year ago

8101365 its awesome mate the first time you see it in real life its a shock factor to be real honest
8101366 its just so big obviously its an extremely impressive boat very very powerful
8101367 for us at the end of the day its all part of our preparation when you look at this boat you just think boy who wouldnt want to see two of these boats race each other its amazing i cant tell you how many four letter words people have used when they see it
8101368 its something that im pretty excited about the main thing with multihulls is you always try to sail as light as you can but with a boat like this and the power its got its also going to take a lot of physical effort by the crew its going to be an interesting few months
8101369 i guess he just like freaked out and hit his head

8101419 if the psychic functions continue to exist as a separate individuality or personality after the death of brain and body
8101420 arranged on a light framework built upon very delicately balanced platform beam scales
8101421 the results were uniformly negative no loss of weight at death
8101422 the ideal tests on dogs would be obtained in those dying from some disease that rendered them much exhausted and incapable of struggle
8101423 it was not my fortune to get dogs dying from such sickness
8101424 barring a local outbreak of distemper one is forced to conjecture that the good doctor calmly poisoned fifteen healthy canines for his little exercise in biological theology
8101425 s uddenly coincident with death the loss was ascertained to be three fourths of an ounce
8101426 the weight lost was found to be half an ounce then my colleague auscultated the heart and and found it stopped i tried again and the loss was one ounce and a half and fifty grains
8101427 my third case showed a weight of half an ounce lost coincident with death and an additional loss of one ounce a few minutes later
8101428 in the fourth case unfortunately our scales were not finely adjusted and there was a good deal of interference by people opposed to our work i regard this test as of no value
8101429 my fifth case showed a distinct drop in the beam requiring about three eighths of an ounce which could not be accounted for this occurred exactly simultaneously with death but peculiarly on bringing the beam up again with weights and later removing them the beam did not sink back to stay for fully fifteen minutes
8101430 my sixth and last case was not a fair test the patient died almost within five minutes after being placed upon the bed and died while i was adjusting the beam

8101439 as bad as the employee free choice act is for large employers it may be fatal for small businesses under current law organizing small employers is not very cost effective small employers are rarely worth the effort and expense given the number of new members the union will get however under the efca only a few organizers will be needed so many employers who were previously ignored by unions will now be directly targeted
8101440 the employee free choice act will have devastating affects on our economy as small employers are driven out of business leaving employees with the only free choice they have finding a new job if they can

8101492 theres a set of tools called edge that were developed on the naughty dog premises actually by a group of very very senior games programmers some from naughty dog and some from elsewhere i think its tremendously visionary of sony to make these tools which are largely low level libraries
8101493 its code that runs on spus and its to do with things like animation compression generalised compression and rendering optimisations these guys are really old school programmers guys who are always looking to shave another cycle off an operation and part of the skill of developing for the playstation 3 is getting the gpu to farm jobs out to the six spus seeing which spus are idling and can take up some of the slack in a frame to frame kind of way
8101494 thats why we think were probably only using 30 or 40 per cent of the power of the ps3 right now and theres this great untapped potential all third party developers can get the edge libraries for free and are going to be able to use them in their own ways to get more and more and more out of the ps3 over the years

8101501 the final challenge for the african christian is to make christianity culturally relevant while holding fast to its ever abiding message

8101566 caffeine appears to block several of the disruptive effects of cholesterol that make the blood brain barrier leaky
8101567 high levels of cholesterol are a risk factor for alzheimers disease perhaps by compromising the protective nature of the blood brain barrier
8101568 caffeine is a safe and readily available drug and its ability to stabilise the blood brain barrier means it could have an important part to play in therapies against neurological disorders
8101569 this is the best evidence yet that caffeine equivalent to one cup of coffee a day can help protect the brain against cholesterol
8101570 in addition to its effect on the vascular system elevated cholesterol levels also cause problems with the blood brain barrier
8101571 this barrier which protects the brain from toxins and infections is less efficient prior to brain damage caused by alzheimers disease or strokes

8101581 far right alliance of elitist corporate plutocrats and religious theocrats has gained control of much of the political discourse in the us by controlling the stories by which the prevailing culture defines the pathway to prosperity security and meaning the far rights favoured versions of these stories affirm the dominator relations of empire

8101840 revenue canada dealt dishonestly with mr longley it is apparent that revenue canada was aware from early on that mr longleys scheme did not appear to be contrary to the provisions of s 127 3 of the act nevertheless they set out to discourage him and his potential contributors by refusing to confirm that fact and ultimately to mislead him with respect to the legal strength of the departments position the department acted without regard for its obligation to deal fairly and openly with all taxpayers and to administer the act in accordance with the law
8101841 i am of the view that the award in this case ought to be one which reflects the courts displeasure with the abuse by revenue canada of its position in the circumstances of this case i have concluded that the appropriate award of punitive damages intended to dissuade revenue canada from acting again in such a high handed arrogant and dishonest way is 50 000

8101983 virgo is a mutable earth sign ruled by mercury as the sixth sign of the zodiac and the only sign represented by a woman the virgo individual is reliable industrious intelligent and practical adhering to standards that are quite high in virtually all aspects of their lives famous and historical figures sharing virgo traits are mother teresa august 27 michael jackson august 29 ivan the terrible september 4 and president william h taft september 15 the virgo personality is a complex mix of intelligence common sense attention to detail and commitment this is a down to earth sign with a strong sense of responsibility especially with regard to family and close friends although they are described as orderly and neat in most personality profiles the modern day virgo may not always stand out from the crowd in the neatness department however even if the virgos house or office is not always in perfect order you can be sure that they still know where to instantly find whatever they need despite it being hidden in a pile somewhere the real stand out feature of the virgo personality is their commitment to excellence in everything they do this is a person who once committed to a given task will complete it to the very best of his ability if something goes wrong and the task is incomplete or not perfectly done it will be on virgos mind for some time to come virgos can be quite critical of perceived flaws in others but do not take kindly to criticism themselves they are very aware of body and health and will take a dim view of comments related to the physical such as weight gain or acne of which they are already painfully aware if life becomes too complicated or their already fragile ego is damaged virgo may become depressed to the point of immobilization at home but will probably still function perfectly in the workplace virgo tends to be fairly careful with money and usually wont be caught without at least a small nest egg tucked away somewhere for those with a virgo child you have an energetic talkative analytic kid who may show maturity beyond his years starting at an early age these kids are constantly seeking out new activities and require a constant stream of books and projects to keep them from becoming bored your virgo child will actually appreciate it when you give him household tasks to complete and will generally do a good job with them asking many questions along the way so he can do the best job possible be sure not to criticize if his job does not turn out just right however as this will deflate his ego and he will not likely want to try again any time soon its better with a virgo to just talk about the nuts and bolts of how you accomplish the same task virgo children are somewhat shy when confronted with new situations so providing them with opportunities to socialize with other kids is an important part of their upbringing virgos will do well in school due to their industrious nature and determination this is a willing little worker who should be supported fully in any direction in which he shows interest such as music or science the virgo child should do well as far as relationships within the family unless there is a sibling with traits that he just cannot abide such as a critical pushy or messy brother or sister in cases like this giving the virgo child a place of his own that he can retreat to is always a good idea virgo in the workplace is generally a dream come true these are intelligent industrious detail oriented people who dont mind having superiors and who will be active team members as long as they are provided with the tools needed to do the job correctly in general they are routine oriented doing their jobs the same way and in the same order day after day and this shouldnt be interfered with or they will be thrown off balance virgo may seem bossy and controlling at work at times but this is not about ego they are not striving to be the top dog rather they have an inner clock by which they work and anyone that interferes is dealt with appropriately according to their virgo standards virgo is a star in the workplace when all their elements are intact workspace that is organized and tidy head organized and tidy and body organized and tidy if anything becomes out of kilter their performance could vary somewhat but not so much in the workplace as in their personal lives which can often become a chaotic mess because of their strong inborn sense of orderliness and the world in general not falling into line if you have found a romantic partner in virgo you have found a classy intelligent and witty partner indeed you may have some trouble landing that virgo as they do tend to look before they leap but when they do take the plunge they do it with gusto once you are in a committed relationship with virgo you will have a partner that is willing to work to please you as long as you remember not to step on their sense of routine and order virgo doesnt mind you taking the lead but will buck if you disturb their sense of how things should be around the household a simple rule of thumb is take care of your virgo and your virgo will take care of you the best matches for virgo are taurus capricorn and another virgo virgos tend to understand each other cancer leo libra and scorpio might work well for some individuals it will likely be tough going with gemini sagittarius and pisces virgo in any relationship will be a diligent hard worker who once imbedded in the friendship will go the extra mile when needed virgos are fairly critical and can tend to be nit picky but if you understand and accept this they will be good friends who will amaze you with their wit and creativity be careful not to step on your virgo friends ego as they may go into a tailspin many a virgo has retreated to alcohol and drugs to lick open wounds all in all however your virgo friend will be an asset and an ally who will allow you to take the lead if you have proven to be a trusted entity in their lives

8102115 this is the reason why i have so often been hindered from coming to you
8102116 and thus i make it my ambition to preach the gospel not where christ has already been named lest i build on someone elses foundation but as it is written
8102117 first i thank my god through jesus christ for all of you because your faith is proclaimed in all the world for god is my witness whom i serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing i mention you always in my prayers asking that somehow by gods will i may now at last succeed in coming to you for i long to see you that i may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you that is that we may be mutually encouraged by each others faith both yours and mine i want you to know brothers that i have often intended to come to you but thus far have been prevented in order that i may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the gentiles
8102118 and they went through the region of phrygia and galatia

8102124 if by excessive labour we die before reaching the average age of man worn out in the masters service then glory be to god we shall have so much less of earth and so much more of heaven it is our duty and our privilege to exhaust our lives for jesus we are not to be living specimens of men in fine preservation but living sacrifices whose lot is to be consumed
8102125 and to be helped on my journey there by you once i have enjoyed your company for a while
8102126 well brother tennant you are the oldest among us do you not rejoice to think that your time is so near at hand when you will be called home
8102127 i have nothing to do with death my business is to live as long as i can and as well as i can and serve my savior as faithfully as i can until he thinks its time to call me home
8102128 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain if i am to live in the flesh that means fruitful labor for me yet which i shall choose i cannot tell i am hard pressed between the two my desire is to depart and be with christ for that is far better but to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account

8102192 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was hungry and you gave me no food i was thirsty and you gave me no drink i was a stranger and you did not welcome me naked and you did not clothe me sick and in prison and you did not visit me then they also will answer saying lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you then he will answer them saying truly i say to you as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it to me and these will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life

8102200 i accepted i was not major league calibre at that point
8102201 the result is that it is very strong and as a result of it being strong it is very safe
8102202 it is impossible for this maple bat to shatter in the way the maple bats shatter in the major leagues today you will never have a barrel separating from the handle the worst thing that can happen is a crack there is never a catastrophic break
8102203 the difference between a catastrophic injury and a bruise is a just little movement
8102204 i liked the handle usually bats like that break easy this felt pretty durable
8102205 all the normal things that happen with bats will happen with this bat
8102206 if you hit a ball on the sweet spot of this bat and the sweet spot of a traditional bat the ball will go equally far
8102207 i cant put a price on the safety of the children
8102208 i dont know the particulars of what it costs if it works well find a way to make it work in montclair
8102209 it sounds like it is supposed to any wood bat is better to me than the ping of the aluminum bat
8102210 you watch the college world series and hear that ping and to me it is not baseball
8102211 its a team that can get you at any point so youve got to kind of be on your toes
8102212 you can never get too comfortable youve got to go out and still be aggressive you cant change your game plan too much but i think theres a point with teams like this that theyre never out of it its a tough team to pitch again
8102213 i honestly dont know how we beat him three times
8102214 hes probably the best pitcher in baseball tonight he had a good night
8102215 when doc is on the mound youve just got to scratch out a few runs and youve got a chance to win
8102216 hes one of the premier pitchers in the league i thought i pitched pretty well tonight but when youre facing halladay youve got to be in your a game
8102217 it definitely wasnt my a game or else i would have won the game
8102218 you cant make too many errors when youre facing a guy like that
8102219 do all we can to help elect barack obama the next president of the united states
8102220 warner youre crazy get a real job no ones going to want a phone in the car
8102221 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8102222 in that case a multi ethnic state will put more pressure on government to govern well
8102223 as que no le sirven las fotos de google earth
8102224 no doctor lo que pasa es que son de muy baja definici n para el an lisis que estamos haciendo y los sujetos de estudio casi ni se ven
8102225 profesor lo que me pide es complicado fotos por sat lite de diferentes regiones del mundo con el nivel de detalle que me dice que necesita nos van a salir costosas
8102226 el costo es insignificante frente al beneficio de la informaci n que podemos obtener
8102227 ya doctor me podr a explicar de nuevo sobre qu es que se trata espec ficamente este estudio
8102228 estamos tratando de averiguar en qu direcci n se paran las vacas alrededor del mundo

8102230 weve had k 9 teams looking for him weve had our air support helicopters looking for him weve also had divers dive
8102231 i saw him going through his normal routine getting into his truck going wherever he does he was always on the go a man of massive energy
8102232 it just seems to me that early in the morning i think somebody hijacked him hes elderly he was by himself and they found his car and not him it just seems to me somebody did something to him
8102233 dejen que les diga algo a cerca del huevo de col n y el quickpwn
8102234 it wasnt intended to be released but the more that we got into it it was like hey lets roll with it and became something we wanted to do
8102235 its good for the body we never do it unless a child is over three years
8102236 i think wed actually be a better team if he werent on the field
8102237 block for mcfadden and jones unless youre marcus monk and then just run a go route
8102238 barack obama es mi candidato y debe ser nuestro presidente

8102240 y tanto si votasteis por m o por obama es hora de unir el partido con un nico l der y un s lo prop sito es una lucha para el futuro y una lucha que debemos ganar
8102241 habr algunos seguidores de la senadora clinton con quienes habr que trabajar duro para convencerles de sumarse eso no es ninguna sorpresa

8102249 ive been taking photos for 45 years and this is the first time this has ever happened to me
8102250 i have taken pictures of demonstrations in front of the white house and this hasnt happened to me i have taken pictures in communist east germany and this hasnt happened to me only in st paul
8102251 when i first took my job the economy was growing and business was booming it looked like i had a great future there i believed if i worked hard i would have my job until i retired
8102252 my job is being shifted to mexico along with my job and most of my 430 co workers that means every single member of my union will be unemployed
8102253 gas and groceries are going up and everybodys paychecks are staying the same families all around michigan are losing their home senator mccain voted against those companies that make products by american workers just like me its time for a change
8102254 i want a president who will keep american jobs here at home the change we need is barack obama for president
8102255 we dont need four more years of the last eight years

8102263 suerte que tenemos una revoluci n est garantizado que nadie permanecer en el olvido si se pierden vidas no ser n cientos o miles por un ras de mar como en santa cruz del sur el 9 de noviembre de 1932 o un flora el 3 de octubre de 1963 que inund el coraz n de las provincias del este de cuba sin una sola presa reguladora como las de hoy que son adem s fuentes de regad o y agua corriente
8102264 es muy importante ganar y jugar bien tenemos que recomponernos la derrota nos doli y hay que sacarse la espina todos estamos molestos con nosotros mismos porque dimos un mal partido ya tenemos ganas de jugar para reivindicarnos
8102265 no siempre que no haya goles es una cuesti n de los delanteros sino del sistema ofensivo hay posibilidad de poner m s gente arriba y tenemos que llegar m s pero tampoco queremos perder la solidez que hemos tenido en otros partidos
8102266 tenemos que ir a atacar sin perder de vista el juego de atr s creo que de locales hemos hecho buenos partidos y tenemos que insistir en ello

8102268 we reiterate our request that the department of justice fulfill its commitment to take prompt action to investigate and to prosecute the american issues project and we further request that the department of justice investigate and prosecute howard sic simmons for a knowing and willful violation of the individual aggregate contribution limits
8102269 having failed in its attempts to get our legal factual and fully supported ad off the air barack obamas campaign now wants to put our donors in prison for exercising their right to free speech
8102270 these over the top bullying tactics are reminiscent of the kind of censorship one would see in a stalinist dictatorship with the only difference being that those guys generally had to wait until they were in power to throw people who disagreed with them into jail
8102271 i just think that they made a big mistake in the choice that they made
8102272 its a no brainer hillary clinton got 18 million votes joe biden got 9 000 votes the normal political thing to do in terms of the best decision to make to win would have been to pick hillary clinton
8102273 john mccain who has tremendous experience who has worked on both sides of the aisle against a senator from illinois who is one of the least experienced candidates we ever had for president
8102274 the union was formed in 1774 became a nation in 1776 became perpetual in 1778 and matured and became more perfect in 1787
8102275 it follows from these views that the states belong to the union and were never sovereignt no matter what the declaration of independence the articles of confederation or the paris peace treaty of 1783 said they were talking about a different kind of sovereignty thats subordinate to union supremacy i said so and i wouldnt lie and anyway i have a good reason
8102276 the constitution is an exhaustive list of expressly reserved rights against the federal government and it protects all vital rights of individuals and minorities therefore the federal government is at liberty do anything that is not expressly prohibited by the constitution
8102277 however even if the federal government breached the constitution by force of numbers then this could only at most justify revolution from a moral standpoint however no state can ever lawfully get out of the union by its own mere motion regardless but all the vital rights of individuals and minorities are so protected by the constitution that controversies never arise concerning them
8102278 finally nevermind what i said in galena illinois in 1856 after all what happens on the campaign trail stays on the campaign trail everyone does it and im sticking to that the supreme court can only limit the federal government on a case by case basis it cannot determine federal law for later cases despite the fact that those cases will come before courts that are also bound by the supreme courts prior decisions according to usc article vi clause 2 concerning state courts and article iii concerning federal courts however a states elected officials are bound by all federal legislation despite statements to the contrary in clause 3 that they are only bound to support the constitution itself

8102325 theres a lot of dialogue in these other municipalities between the organization and elected officials but it seems like its just exploration at this point
8102326 they have done some great things over the years playing together you have to game plan for them because they both make big plays
8102327 you have to contain them you have to get good edges on your defense and make sure they dont get loose and keep them inside where all your tacklers are
8102328 it has been a lot of hard work for the last three years it is something i have to take advantage of everyone wants to go out there and start for the alabama crimson tide
8102329 when mikheil saakashvili attacked the russian peacekeepers in tskhinvali he expected to find success or at least some cashable western support
8102330 a fair bet is saakashvili through his closest american friend and former agent randy scheunemann
8102331 the idea of bombing iran did not catch fire this summer but these people are ambitious they never let up one project without starting another in their way of thinking the united states to keep the archaic constitution at bay and our enemies on the run must always be occupied with a war somewhere iraq may be turning into a peaceful occupation afghanistan is getting to be an old story why not start a war in georgia at best you push back against putin and show him to be a hollow threat or a different advantage you make a pitiful spectacle of the tears and the trampled pride of saakashvili and prove the brutality of russia which has never really changed so you restart the cold war a very good thing indeed as for the run for president on this issue as on fisa and iran barack obama can easily be shown to be a diluted version of mccain
8102332 cpd ii broadened its base considerably from the original group by including in its ranks top labor officials jewish liberals and it managed this feat by including in its ideology not only a strong anti soviet policy but also one which promoted growth and expansion
8102333 a great historical occasion perhaps as significant as the signing of the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965 perhaps in the future history will record that it may be even more significant mr president because i think it deals with an issue on a basic human right thats the most basic of all human rights the right to a job and that is a central priority now of our economic policy with the signing of this act into law today
8102334 is serious left criticism of governments share of gdp possible
8102335 the world supply of gold is insufficient to make the present system workable particularly as the use of the dollar as a reserve currency is essential to create the required international liquidity to sustain world trade and growth
8102336 our role of world leadership in a political and military sense is the only reason for our current embarrassment in an economic sense on the one hand and on the other the correction of the economic embarrassment under present monetary systems will result in an untenable position economically for our allies
8102337 mas n s pregamos a jesus cristo crucificado esc ndalo para os judeus e loucura para os gregos

8102418 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him and i was afraid to trust him and i was afraid to have hope when i first kind of became aware of him
8102419 were all out of touch how could we possibly have an awareness of what real americans feel and think and need because we just ride around in limos and i dont know buy diamonds all day long
8102420 im certainly not like that im a passionate american and thats what i am first and foremost

8102430 a s far as the internet making us meaner it does remove a natural censor that we have that commands us to treat people with common respect an exception apparently are the people posting on this board whose intelligence humility and wit are extremely frustrating in that theyre disproving my point and that drives me nuts
8102431 there had even been an internal memo about the railings

8102434 the movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet all the action scenes had a goal they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24

8102444 president bush cares very deeply about the families of our fallen heroes
8102445 the president gladly would have let mrs holt punch his favored right arm if it didnt still sting from when little abigail pritchard give him a five second indian burn for her grandmother being killed in the aftermath of hurricane katrina
8102446 in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8102447 eu assinei os decretos que reconhecem a independ ncia da oss tia do sul e da abkh zia
8102448 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together in the twin cities these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart

8102450 those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8102451 im sure this is just because of the unusual amount of rain weve been getting oh we can fit the bed in this corner

8102496 there is now little doubt that solar wind variability streams of ionized gases that radiate out from the sun is the primary cause of climate change on a decadal time scale
8102497 anything that falls beyond the purview of anthropogenic human caused global warming is not going to be seriously investigated by the ipcc
8102498 thats why the ipcc should never be viewed as a scientific manual it was created for the sole purpose of supporting the notion of human induced climate change
8102499 por que rimos e choramos por aquilo que n o existe aquilo que fantasia

8102517 according to the suspects statements so far there is a strong suspicion that roni and marie are involved in violent abuse and the murder of rose
8102518 he confessed to investigators and reconstructed the events of that tragic night when he gave the child a blow a blow he did not expect to have such a result
8102519 he was under pressure panicked was very worried about his partners likely reaction and as a result took action to conceal the body
8102520 if we get a chance to help make an impact on a kids life thats why were here
8102521 i kept hitting good shots and then i chipped one in thats the way golf goes i kept telling my caddie man weve played pretty good today weve been pretty much in every hole with a chance to do something special and somebody tops me i top somebody then coming down the stretch i hit some good shots and got a couple of good breaks
8102522 i had to compose myself guys dont have to do that its just a reflection on who he singh is as a person he understands and respects what were trying to get done
8102523 hes never played a fundraising event this was going to be his first one ever
8102524 i think that speaks to the amount of respect he has for our friendship weve been together now for over 20 years
8102525 i suspect theres a tremendous chance hell be on the property next year but the most important thing is that he gets his knee back where he wants to
8102526 pachuca es uno de esos equipos que todo lo hace en mediacancha pero anda muy desesperado porque no le est n saliendo las cosas y eso se vuelve dif cil para nosotros porque los equipos desesperados se desordenan y su estilo de juego cambia

8102540 i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8102541 its a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time and theyve done a very good job with difficult situations in all aspects
8102542 so they made the call wrong once in a while weve all done things wrong once in a while
8102543 for every human individual out there were all playing our best we make errors its part of the game
8102544 we dont get a chance to go back i want a mulligan its not the way it works its not the way it should work

8102550 moskva has today departed toward the black sea fleets naval training range to check its radio controlled weapons and onboard communications systems
8102551 the fact that there are nine western warships in the black sea cannot but be a cause for concern they include two us warships one each from spain and poland and four from turkey
8102552 these missile systems are intended to be used for testing and training purposes to simulate threats that may come from countries with ex soviet systems in their inventories
8102553 the missile systems were not purchased to be launched against perceived enemies and they will not be included in the inventory of the turkish armed forces tsk they will be tested at the konya range with ehts systems their radars and fire control systems are to be bought separately
8102554 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
8102555 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression

8102559 tough action is necessary if we are to achieve real change
8102560 theyve got to prove to the fans that theyre worth the money theyre asking
8102561 win a championship show the fans that what theyre doing on the field is worth the prices that fans are going to have to pay
8102562 if you go to the zoo what do the kids want to do they want to put their nose right up to the glass
8102563 were all kids in a way when it comes to sports we want to get right up close
8102564 it does provide some consideration to the hard working middle class fan
8102565 hopefully the jets will put a good product on the field which they havent done for the last couple of years
8102566 will be a disaster if it was the same old jets whod want to spend the money
8102567 its okay to cry sweetie do you want to hear a secret mommy cries at the dentist too i still think youre very brave

8102571 keep your head up if you escape hell we gettin fucked up when we was eight we went to bat day to see the yanks in sixty nine his father and mines they robbed banks he pointed to the charm on his neck with his last bit of energy left told me rock it with respect i opened it seen the god holdin his kids photogenic tears just burst out my wig
8102572 right now wed be more than happy to order you a pellet stove for next year
8102573 yeah about that i dont have it on me but ill bring it to your home tommorrow
8102574 i cannot control this i cannot control this i cannot control this i cannot fucking control this let it go let it go let it fucking go
8102575 i have good news aetna has waived the 2 year waiting period id like to get max listed today if you have the time to go over a couple things first
8102576 are you fucking kidding me id make the time even if i was on my fucking deathbed and couldnt breathe id make the time even if we were in the midst of a tornado and you told me i needed to go stand on a bridge while you talked to me
8102577 i have the time right now im walking home from the park but i can talk right now
8102578 the thing that we care about right now is getting our team better if you watched our first three pre season games theres a lot of work we have to do
8102579 whether its your second year in the league or 12th year in the league its a pretty somber day
8102580 just in the sense of guys that are potentially losing their jobs typically its kind of weird
8102581 i dont think that the players at the same position are necessarily in competition with each other
8102582 we want to keep the best players and that may be a balanced roster or not it may include a few more players at one position and a few less at another
8102583 i know the backfield is crowded but ive also said i know what im capable of doing
8102584 unfortunately i had this setback with the injury this past couple of weeks but once they make their decision what theyre going to do if im here its just up to me to make sure that come sunday im at my best
8102585 i guess especially in pre season we actually get more reps or more carries than we do in the actual game i think it puts the onus a little more individually to go out and execute with the limited amount of actual game reps
8102586 we probably have one of the deepest backfields in the league
8102587 the thing about us is that we all bring something different to the table which gives the defence a different look
8102588 if you are running a race with a guy and he is a lap ahead of you and you have a strong finish you are still going to finish behind him
8102589 if you are neck and neck with the guy and you have a strong finish then you beat him and it makes a lot of difference
8102590 so it would depend on what the relationship of the competition is at this point for how much the last game means
8102591 john mccain voted with bush 95 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick

8102602 sister if you want to talk if you have any problems i am just here
8102603 i guess i have a deep interest and love for water and the water landscapes that define canada
8102604 i believe that if we look at things from a watershed perspective well realize that water flows downstream and if we take care of the problems upstream the problems downstream will take care of themselves infrastructure to me should be focused on watershed basis i maintain that we do have the money were just spending it willy nilly across the landscape and if we focused it on water wed be able to solve a lot of water problems faster
8102605 theyre amazing people and theyve extended me all the support i would need at least to make the contacts and find my way
8102606 ive made some excellent contacts and have some offers of accommodation from institutes so there are options
8102607 being a water deficit region of the world israel has learned to deal with a lot of water challenges with a quarter of the water per person that we have in canada
8102608 theyve made amazing innovations in agriculture and water use im hoping to go there and learn what policy and legislature efforts they created in israel that enabled them to deal with these problems my interest is on the prairies and climate change where we might face the same problems as israel but 20 to 50 years in the future israel is a sneak peek at what we might face and i think there will be significant insights we can apply to the prairie situation
8102609 i thought i was the f ing director are we starting this already

8102618 yeah claire i can never find her shes very flighty
8102619 explique las razones de la demora en el desarrollo de la ley estatal que regula la subcontrataci n en el sector de la construcci n
8102620 la comunidad ha sido de las ltimas en regular el registro de empresas acreditadas de la construcci n y su tramitaci n es lenta
8102621 la insumisi n de la generalitat ya que deja fuera de la legalidad a los empresarios y pone en riesgo la seguridad de los trabajadores a costa de hacer pol tica contra el gobierno central
8102622 si se han tomado las medidas para informar a los empresarios y facilitar el cumplimiento de los plazos de la normativa
8102623 que el pp est agravando la incertidumbre y la inseguridad que se ciernen sobre las empresas de la construcci n en momentos en los que el sector requiere sensatez y responsabilidad por parte de la generalitat
8102624 las competencias sobre econom a y creaci n de empleo son exclusiva del presidente de la generalitat
8102625 est interponiendo al desarrollo de una ley que tiene como objetivo reducir los altos ndices de siniestralidad laboral fomentar la estabilidad en el empleo y ordenar la subcontrataci n
8102626 we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyrights interests in the watchmen and enjoin the release of the warner bros film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property

8102628 this eve been notified by organizations planning debates theyve been cancelled
8102629 i n my opinion the best format and the best forum for voters is to see the candidates is in a debate
8102630 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8102631 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8102632 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8102633 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8102634 i dont know about you but thats not just right
8102635 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8102636 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8102637 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8102638 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8102639 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8102640 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8102641 because i cant sleep at night i cant pass along a planet to my children my grandchildren great grandchildren
8102642 we encourage our customers to come in with their tupperware so we can use tupperware and thats reusable and that doesnt see a landfill
8102643 i always felt initiatives such as this really needs to come from the grassroots level
8102644 its a cost that im willing to bear and its offset by other initiatives that were doing
8102645 i think when we make choices of where we go out thats certainly one of the factors wed consider

8102648 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8102649 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8102650 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8102651 were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage
8102652 right now these players teams look like they are going to produce at an epic pace for the foreseeable future but for some reason i believe they may be one and done as far as their prolific contributions to the sport are concerned

8102676 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
8102677 depending on where you focus on the details of the report you can see some different stories on where home prices are headed record year over year declines were reported in both the 10 city and 20 city composites in june however they are very close to the values reported for may the rate of home price decline may be slowing for the month the 10 city composite was down 0 6 and the 20 city composite was down 0 5 while still falling these are far less than the 2 2 5 monthly drops seen earlier in 2008 in june nine of the 20 cities were up month to month compared with seven in may nevertheless not one market is showing a positive return over the past 12 months and seven of the metro areas are reporting declines in excess of 20 0
8102678 the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output to further its long run objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 2 percent
8102679 the federal open market committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports however labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability

8102681 what did you do with the children i placed under your care as a teacher
8102682 what is given can be taken away everyone lies everyone dies
8102683 but then she called me back saying that her mom pretty much has told her that no she needs to keep the baby and that shes not giving it up for adoption even though she really did not want to have the baby
8102684 i have spent every day since monday june 9 2008 looking for my daughter
8102685 i have lied and stolen from friends and family to do whatever i could by any means to find my daughter i avoided calling the police or even notifying my family out of fear i have been and still am afraid of what has or may happen to caylee
8102686 if i really wanted to just get rid of her i wouldve left her with my parents and i wouldve left
8102687 i wouldve moved out i wouldve given my mom custody
8102688 it was awful i had to work out a lot and could only eat certain things it was the regime of it all that i didnt enjoy
8102689 for the first two weeks of shooting i wore my robe and wouldnt take it off until we filmed
8102690 but then i realized nobody cared the cast and crew really didnt care
8102691 unless i bat 100 percent perhaps a boy awaits us
8102692 i have been a dolly fan all of my life shes a wonderful woman i really connect with her music i cant think of a better role model for my children
8102693 she has this great sweet personality but shes also strong and wise
8102694 i dont think its something well decide until the baby comes
8102695 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8102696 were you in this campaign just for me or for that young marine and others like him that mom
8102697 we need a president who understands that the genius of america has always depended on the strength and vitality of the middle class
8102698 barack obama understands that change must start from the ground up not the top down
8102699 i cannot wait to watch barack obama to sign into law a health care law that covers every american
8102700 its no surprise that next week john mccain and george bush will be together in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8102701 when you hear the dogs keep going when you see the torches in the woods keep going
8102702 lets elect barack obama and joe biden for that future worthy of our great country

8102708 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the cease fire deal
8102709 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8102710 russia is making i would say a number of irrational decisions
8102711 we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
8102712 the only place these people want to be is home and they cant go home because of what has happened to them and because of the situation that the russians have caused
8102713 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences

8102716 i saw in israel there were answers to a lot of the problems we have here in manitoba and i thought gee why try to reinvent the wheel rather than try to form lasting partnerships with the israelis
8102717 there are a few commonalities between israel and manitoba when it comes to water
8102718 for example how to preserve the wetlands and freshwater lakes we dont have many lakes in israel but because we have very few we monitor and maintain them carefully by contrast manitoba has a lot of water bodies but theyre not controlled very carefully and some are impacted by nutrients and contaminants theres a lot of potential water resources to tap and exploit but a gafni was joined by professorstrategy is needed to address the problems
8102719 the conference went excellently with a positive constructive atmosphere we hope to come up with some common ideas and work on them together this is an important step in a relationship we established a year ago

8102726 our requirement was to complete the assessment and submit the report to congress and we will just kind of wait to see what happens at that point
8102727 we think we can develop the guidelines and we think we can do that within the industry itself
8102728 im not sure any of the agencies except for the one or two that deal with the motor carriers truly appreciate the significance of the trucking industry
8102729 you are talking about a new agency it now has a lot of solid experience in the airline industry it has little if any experience in the trucking industry
8102730 there is logically going to be a tendency to take what they learned in the airline industry then somehow take the trucking industry and cram it into that model
8102731 if there are any other regulations that come out from the assessment or directed from congress we will continue to work with industry as closely as we have

8102835 system architects will be able to use the small size and energy efficiency of the intel atom to improve a wide range of applications especially those with rigorous instant on requirements
8102836 normally an operating system can take precious seconds to complete the boot process
8102837 this is unacceptable to many embedded device makers whose end users expect virtually no perceptual delay from the moment a device is switched on to the moment it operates the intel atom processor z500 series along with qnx neutrino fast boot technology and the qnx aviage hmi middleware allows developers to deliver a compelling user experience while also maintaining realtime performance and high availability
8102838 the dmc 1000 is a revolutionary product that will greatly enhance the overall digital lifestyle of consumers
8102839 our challenge was to design a feature rich and sophisticated product that was intuitive to use and ready for the challenges of mass market adoption by building the cutting edge dmc 1000 on the qnx platform we were able to optimize the dmc 1000s design and performance and to ensure future compatibility with our fast evolving line of digital media centers
8102840 qnx neutrino is designed for mission critical environments where software failure is not an option
8102841 as the infotainment industry evolves and new technologies are introduced to the market we are seeing strong demand and new applications for our highly reliable industry proven software for a top of the line product like the dmc 1000 which sets the standard for crossover use in the home car and office qnx neutrino is the ideal rtos because it can handle the rigors of virtually any environment
8102842 as telematics infotainment and navigation systems become increasingly significant differentiators in the auto market staying on top of next generation innovations is critical
8102843 together qnx and skoda are developing the necessary technology to produce the best in car experience in the industry

8102862 he is waiting to take this to trial and bring out the truth the fact of the matter is that they have tried their best to keep us from defending this case by sending the same girls to texas to file then to new york its a travelling circus that brought their own tickets and followed him from state to state and claim something happened in every state the way they manipulated the system and gridlocked us into a no bail situation is terrible and against the us constitution which states every person has the right to a reasonable bail why are we being denied that

8102874 oh south by the week that austin turns into la
8102875 weve always run great city programs but since the park redevelopment weve seen a boost in community turnout with this new facility we were able to add a master swim program more aquatic exercise classes and even host birthday parties
8102876 right now we are in the middle of an entire modernization program and gap really sets the tone for this movement the strength of the aquatics park is that it gives everyone from one year old to 90 years old the opportunity to use this facility
8102877 this facility brings a huge draw to the area weve had people come from as far as chico bringing in all these visitors provides us an opportunity to support our economic development which is so important right now
8102878 we worked collaboratively and imaginatively to create a sustainable well designed user friendly aquatic center and park space for this community
8102879 the dummy became so entwined with the wreckage of the car that he had to be removed piece by piece

8102881 we should afford them the respect that they are entitled and call them by their legal name
8102882 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8102883 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8102884 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8102885 i know has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and john mccain for president
8102886 i didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
8102887 america must stand firmly on the side of freedom and justice
8102888 ive never been a team i shouldve been a one man band
8102889 i think campaigning is part of the job and debating is part of campaigning
8102890 the sense of leaving your neighborhood and going somewhere different where you have to learn new things and become part of another community is the whole point of going to a summer camp
8102891 nowadays there are a lot more of what we call helicopter parents theyre hovering over their kids trying to make everything perfect but kids dont learn from only having successes
8102892 parents often assume that all summer camps are licensed to run their business and are monitored for safety in some way
8102893 i know from personal experience if there is no system if no one is watching then the attitude is who cares
8102894 that means we have to make sure fingerprints of all employees are verified for background checks food is stored at proper temperatures bathroom facilities are inspected
8102895 you name it well have thought of it and we have a license to prove it
8102896 it used to be if you were a kid and wanted to have fun you ran home from school dropped your books and went out and played
8102897 but now theres more of a fear factor who else will be there is the park safe can i reach my child
8102898 one year we had this little girl about 6 years old who was extremely shy
8102899 she had been seeing a speech therapist and was really self conscious about it after a little bit of playing a little bit of art and a little time she was up on a stage doing skits and singing songs her enunciation was 100 times better by the end of the summer and her speech therapist said they had never seen so much growth in such a short period of time
8102900 we work with kids who are especially anxious and have little confidence we help the kid who quits playing a game because they hate losing for example
8102901 we had three middle school age kids with aspergers whose parents say they just dont relate socially and never had any friends at school after a few summers together at camp they all three got together and started to hang out on their own whatd they do they worked together on building a nuclear submarine of course sounds unusual but they found a way to relate and do something they enjoy
8102902 people make the mistake of thinking their child wouldnt be interested in this type of camp but the fact is we make it fun and all kids love to have fun
8102903 all the kids come away from our camp with a new technological skill
8102904 its not like they come in and play video games but they might come in and make their own video games these kids end up going back to regular schools mentoring other children and sometimes even teachers on technology that cant help but blossom a childs self esteem
8102905 we in the camp industry call this new generation the millennials
8102906 we understand that these are some very computer and technologically savvy kids they have that need to be text messaging and building their myspace pages keeping up with them can be a challenge
8102907 it doesnt matter what century it is the bottom line is that kids just want to have fun
8102908 id gaming academy and id tech camps do a great job of providing personal tech instruction to young people

8102916 on the separation of sense and state a clarification for the people of the church in northern colorado
8102917 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8102918 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
8102919 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
8102920 the expectation of increased pricing pressure has prompted moodys investors service to change its outlook on the canadian wireless telecommunications sector from positive to stable

8102924 shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
8102925 any ideas that we have about her hair are always theoretical and we always have to be prepared but she is not performing and so we dont have to worry about that
8102926 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform at this year amp squo s vmas
8102927 the film is not about diana georgiana is an incredible person on her own without need to draw parallels
8102928 the two were related by ancestry and united by destiny
8102929 georgina was incredibly glamorous obviously and politically she was incredibly influential but also incredibly vulnerable and shes really navigating her way through a marriage that is entirely loveless
8102930 there is absolutely no reason to have done this trailer the marketing people probably thought the only way they could get the young popcorn eating brigade to see this film was if they made some comparison with diana
8102931 but they did not need to and should not have done it trailers should be what the film is about but in this case the trailer is not connected to the film

8102949 your first mmog is kind of like your first love im not convinced that any game will persuade first time mmog players who enjoy wow to leave it those people who are hunting for new games who are tired of the old who want something new they tend to be people who already have hopped games once or more when players find a game they like a game that really grabs them a game that defines the mmo genre in their minds and lays out what an mmog should be for them its going to take either a serious blow to their game blizzard announces that theyre done making expansions or a serious improvement to the game style on the everquest gt wow level to lure them away
8102950 there should be a store dedicated to saving male shoppers it would be an ordinary trendy department store or whatever but right in the middle of it thered be a sports bar thered be hdtvs that played sports and had playstations hooked up to them along with pool tables darts etc guys could get those little black disks that they hand out at restaurants when his girlfriend wife whatever female who dragged him finally made it to checkout the black disk could light up and vibrate letting the guy know it was time to go the guy could get one free beer for every hour his partner was in the store but hadnt yet bought anything give me a department store like that and i would happily go shopping every fuckin week

8102958 i just feel that when i read blogs about how great war will be and how much wow sucks now it tends to set me off a bit wow sucks no less than it did at launch its just that people burned out on it so quick they just cant bring themselves to say anything positive about the game now for some reason there are all these flaws that war is going to fix and im saying thats a pipe dream
8102959 no need making wow the bad guy if your bored because youve done it all its not wows fault its basically the players
8102960 gankers are getting their jollies in an endless circle of confirming their own expectations mistaking the increasing number of notches on their belt for actual personal development
8102961 a miner is trundling along trying to get ore to town for the purposes of building a commercial empire while a player killer is there playing another game entirely
8102962 you may be playing eve online but be warned we are playing something awful
8102963 interestingly the miner in our little example is perfectly capable of regarding the marauding player killer as equivalent to just another monster instead hes angered more because he sees this monster as a player the complete disregard for the feelings of the victim is only possible because the victim occupies an uncomfortable position midway between real person and score token if they were a just a token the ganker would not bother
8102964 specifically stated otherwise as a desired component of the game
8102965 im not going to tell you i told you so

8102977 do muslims believe that a murder will spend more time burning for his sin vs a person who ate during fast
8102978 do they believe once forgiven everyone will go to heaven and get same rewords
8102979 yeah i like it but you should talk to person a b and c to see if they like it
8102980 but you like it cant i just put it in the game
8102981 you can but its at your own peril because if they dont like it well go back and change it
8102982 the game wasnt that great it had some glitches but it was still pretty impressive to look at and say i actually made that
8102983 we have all types of kids coming to camp those who are really interested in technology and those who just want to try something new
8102984 its more than sitting in front of the computer youre learning while youre having fun
8102985 its hands on learning as opposed to lecturing kids learn about video games by creating video games
8102986 its really fun its way more than just computer camp
8102987 their self esteem cant help but blossom because they take these skills and really apply them to their lives the types of products they use are just phenomenal and the outcome is outstanding
8102988 kids come in with some interest in computers and video games but were actually teaching them pretty advanced stuff they receive college type instruction in web and design
8102989 we try to encourage kids to do what they want to do
8102990 we try to bring those two worlds interest and learning together its an extra bonus if kids are really interested because they can get really inspired
8102991 just want to play video games all day and those kids who are really serious and want to pursue this in college
8102992 although camp is fun and you dont want it to end after staring at the computer screen for four straight hours you want to go outside and breathe some fresh air
8102993 they were kind of an escape from reality it was kind of like watching a movie but youre actually playing
8102994 i thought it was really neat to learn how to make video games
8102995 id tech camp gave me an insight into what kind of knowledge i need to really make it in this industry
8102996 i thought id take it one more step so i can learn more
8102997 it was great because i definitely didnt have the tools or the knowledge to create a video game at home and they taught me all of that
8102998 the initial setup is a little bit tricky if youre not familiar with installing servers and server software but once you get it going it works very smoothly also for many the initial cost of buying the software might be prohibitive
8102999 in general these people are gifted they adore being the center of everyones attention but they prefer to be recognized for their skills and are easily flattered on the other hand these people have an honesty and genuine warmth which attracts lots of people and helps them make new friends people generally confide in a horse person because he she is sincerely interested in their thoughts and feelings and is able to help with both wise words and an action however there is a small problem about it the horse person is so excited by new discoveries that it is difficult for them to keep a secret this is not something that arises out of malice or revenge sometimes they just cannot help themselves
8103000 horses are in conflict with tai sui in this rat year this years luck is not good and evil stars amalgamate in your life chart lucky stars are unable to lend strength every matter is not going smoothly wealth luck is low so you have to be calm and endure this harsh period be extra vigilant when investing or signing contracts to prevent falling into traps causing losses in wealth and reputation
8103001 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8103002 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8103003 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8103004 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
8103005 if everyone goes to hell then you will meet all your friends there

8103014 the first summer camp was in 1861 and it was quite a while until specialty camps came to be
8103015 everyone thinks it is just a bunch of geeky kids
8103016 but you get kids who are gifted who are there and you get kids who may just like web design or being creative
8103017 parents come in and they want to know what their kids have learned
8103018 this is a niche camp we teach children how to build games using proprietary software from many of the game manufacturers themselves we have different levels of instruction so that campers can start at a beginning level and work their way up to more difficult programming tasks at the end of the week the students get to take their games home on a cd where they can continue to work on them if they want with help from the manufacturers
8103019 its really simpler than you might expect to create all the features i made a simple game and it took two to three days to create it
8103020 ive always wanted to make a video game with my own characters since i was little
8103021 im having fun doing everything its great making my own backgrounds drawing my own things animating everything and making it all work the program they have makes it really easy because it does everything for you
8103022 even though each game is different the problems are often similar in nature making them easy to diagnose and fix
8103023 this is the kind of camp that i would have wanted to do when i was their age the kids are learning a lot about games and programming concepts in general and were all having a lot of fun
8103024 isnt at the top of the list for the most bites

8103031 gold is likely to regain 1 000 oz by end 2008 and to work higher through 2009 2010
8103032 longer term we believe that gold is capable of doubling or tripling from current levels
8103033 we remain positive on gold based on macro and supply demand factors the forces that have propelled gold for 5 years are firmly in place
8103034 following a series of downside fundamental tests gold appears to have found a floor and quietly climbed back to 917 oz
8103035 despite extensive hand wringing the floor in the dollar has inflicted minimal damage
8103036 we believe the drivers of the gold bull market remain intact heading into a favorable period
8103037 we see gold as well positioned heading into autumn when fabrication tends to heighten the market
8103038 should inflation accelerate while interest rates are locked under economic weakness gold could spike near past inflation adjusted highs
8103039 we view this as an extremely hospitable macro environment and believe the ongoing investment driven demand phase will continue for gold particularly as the broader investor base is not yet fully involved
8103040 gold is coming into its own with discourse dominated by credit crisis derivatives dislocations currencies inflation and self reinforcing financial negatives we believe gold is entering friendly macroeconomic territory
8103041 investment dominates demand with western macro driven investment demand taking prices higher and eastern jewelry fabrication filling in during periodic pullbacks
8103042 we believe gold has entered a new investment driven phase amid a much more hospitable macro environment while gold prices have been rising since 2002 this was largely due to the pull from pro cyclical basic materials and oil in a benign if unbalanced macro environment
8103043 we remain positive on gold based on a mix of macro and supply demand drivers the forces that have propelled gold for the past five years are in place and intensifying
8103044 appreciation remains muted relative to other metals and oil with prices barely regaining long term constant dollar averages corrections are expected along the way and buying on weakness is recommended which seems to be the central lesson of the past five years
8103045 within the pulse of investment demand catalysts for the gold market rally have shifted from safe haven demand during the early stages of the credit crisis in august september 2007 to currencies as the us dollar plummeted to the broader reflation trade on display in oil coordinated fed and central bank action to thaw credit markets and boost liquidity should be positive for hard assets and gold
8103046 with equity and fixed income markets facing stiff headwinds we expect weightings toward gold to increase especially as it has been rising in multiple currencies
8103047 this could be amplified by petro dollar flows and sovereign investment funds we continue to see gold as a small market with motivated buyers india china russia petro players and few sellers of size
8103048 the key variables will be the extent to which jewelry demand slips and the amount of new scrap becomes available
8103049 the last major price push was the 2006 gain 36 that cut jewelry demand by 16 and inspired 25 more scrap supply we believe a similar pattern is likely in 2008 although more muted due to dollar depreciation and less available scrap
8103050 we believe the likelihood of imf sales are low we regard central bank sales as a normal recurring feature of the gold market that has faded from relevance as a price determinant
8103051 never before has a country risen as fast as china is doing
8103052 although the gold price may fluctuate over the very long run gold has consistently reverted to its historic purchasing power parity against other commodities and intermediate products historically gold has proved to be an effective preserver of wealth it has also proved to be a safe haven in times of economic and social instability in a period of a long bull run in equities with low inflation and relative stability in foreign exchange markets it is tempting for investors to expect continual high rates of return on investments it sometimes takes a period of falling stock prices and market turmoil to focus the mind on the fact that it may be important to invest part of ones portfolio in an asset that will at least hold its value

8103057 the speaker is the mother of five children and seven grandchildren and fully appreciates the sanctity of family she was raised in a devout catholic family who often disagreed with her pro choice views
8103058 after she was elected to congress and the choice issue became more public as she would have to vote on it she studied the matter more closely
8103059 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view
8103060 the speaker has a long proud record of working with the catholic church on many issues including alleviating poverty and promoting social justice and peace
8103061 the obama campaign knows it cant argue the facts of the link between obama and ayers so it is instead resorting to a desperate campaign of intimidation and legal threats
8103062 the scary question this raises is if barack obama demonstrates this little regard for free speech from his opponents during the campaign what could the american people expect from him as a president
8103063 the tremendous amount of time money and effort the campaign is expending to run its own ads on the ayers controversy and dispatch its hired guns all over the country during the democratic convention speaks to the fear they must have that this issue is resonating with american voters

8103066 i used to be happy with my class and then i started reading the class forums
8103067 are you the beowulf who took on breca daring to swim the open seas risking your lives for a foolish boast no man friend or foe could stop you from that sorry venture you both rowed out into the strait and embraced the currents weaving the water with your hands gliding over the winter swells for seven nights you fought the sea but he got the better of you being stronger in the morning he was cast up on shore and from there sought his own homeland dear to his people the brondings land where he was rich in land and rings the son of beanstan fulfilled his boast and so i expect the worst for you however you prevail in war if you wait at night for grendel
8103068 again and again savage assailants pressed me sorely but i served them proper justice those wicked monsters held no feast on my dead flesh in the morning their slashed corpses littered the shore and never since have they hindered unwary travellers on that sea road gods bright beacon rose in the east the wild sea stilled and at last i saw the headlands if courage endures fate will spare a hero from death it was my good fortune to kill nine monsters with my sword i have not heard of more grievous battle waged at night under heavens vault nor of a man more wretched than i was adrift on the sea yet i survived weary from battle the sea flood bore me off to finn land i have not heard such stories of you nor of breca that either of you made such bright terror in your swordplay i do not boast of it but you have only killed your brother saving your sword for your own kinsman and you are damned for it sharp as you are i say to you truly son of edgelaf that if your heart were as battle fierce as your talk is grendel would never have humbled heorot theres no fight no storm of blades from the victory scyldings to spoil his pleasures he takes his toll sparing no one ill show grendel the might of the geats ill bring him war now and when the sun brings the new day clad in radiance men will be able to drink in peace

8103079 i think the main contents of his anwars policies are sound and they do make sense economically over the long run because it should have a positive impact on malaysias competitiveness
8103080 but i do question his ability to deliver them when and if he does become prime minister given that the opposition coalition that he leads is comprised of three parties with widely differing agendas and ideologies

8103109 a friend is someone who sees through you and still enjoys the view
8103110 life too short to forget to say i love you too long to remember you forgot

8103118 this is the beginning of a new day you have been given this day to use as you will you can waste it or use it for good what you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it when tomorrow comes this day will be gone forever in its place is something that you have left behind let it be something good
8103119 and while it takes courage to achieve greatness it takes more courage to find fulfillment in being ordinary
8103120 but the biggest mistake i made is the one that most of us make while doing this i did not live in the moment enough this is particularly clear now that the moment is gone captured only in photographs there is one picture of the three on them sitting in the grass on a quilt in the shadow of the swing set on a summer day ages 6 4 and 1 and i wish i could remember what we ate and what we talked about and how they sounded and how they looked when they slept that night i wish i had not been in a hurry to get on to the next things dinner bath book bed i wish i had treasured the doing a little more and the getting it done a little less
8103121 enjoy the little things in life for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things
8103122 life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away
8103123 who knew a sunbeam could be so enchanting that a game of peekaboo could make you laugh every time who knew simple baby songs were so wonderfully silly or that bananas make the best fingerpaints who knew that one little person could take my hand and show me the world all over again
8103124 know what it is to be a child to see a world in a grain of sand and heaven in a wild flower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour
8103125 life may not be the party we hoped but while were here we should dance
8103126 happiness is not having what you want its wanting what you have anonymous
8103127 cleaning the house while your kids are still growing is like shoveling the walk before it stops snowing

8103129 life is short break the rules forgive quickly kiss slowly love truly laugh uncontrollably and never regret anything that made you smile
8103130 life is what happens to you while youre busy making other plans
8103131 life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away
8103132 we flatter those we scarcely know we please the fleeting guest and deal full many a thoughtless blow to those who love us best
8103133 i believe in the total depravity of inanimate things the elusiveness of soap the knottiness of strings the transitory nature of buttons the inclination of suspenders to twist and of hooks to forsake their lawful eyes and cleave only unto the hairs of their hapless owners head
8103134 sometimes being a brother is even better than being a superhero marc brown
8103135 life is short break the rules forgive quickly kiss slowly love truly laugh uncontrollably and never regret anything that made you smile
8103136 drench yourself in words unspoken live your life with arms wide open today is where your book begins the rest is still unwritten
8103137 love like youll never be hurt sing like no one is listening dance like no one is watching live like its heaven on earth
8103138 life is not measured by the number of breaths we takebut by the moments that take our breath away
8103139 life is what happens to you while youre busy making other plans
8103140 i believe the nicest and sweetest days are not those on which anything very splendid or wonderful or exciting happens but just those that bring simple little pleasures following one another softly like pearls slipping off a string
8103141 once in a while right in the middle of an ordinary life love gives us a fairy tale
8103142 only those who truly love and who are truly strong can sustain their lives as a dream you dwell in your own enchantment life throws stones at you but your love and your dream change those stones into the flowers of discovery even if you lose or are defeated by things your triumph will always be exemplary and if no one knows it then there are places that do people like you enrich the dreams of the worlds and it is dreams that create history people like you are unknowing transformers of things protected by your own fairy tale by love
8103143 life becomes precious and more special to us when we look for the little everyday miracles and get excited about the privileges of simply being human
8103144 there is no such thing in anyones life as an unimportant day
8103145 photographers deal in things which are continually vanishing and when they have vanished there is no contrivance on earth which can make them come back again
8103146 photography is a way of feeling of touching of loving what you have caught on film is captured forever it remembers little things long after you have forgotten everything
8103147 photography takes an instant out of time altering life by holding it still
8103148 the actual meaning of any photograph lies less in its visual facts and more in what these details evoke inside the mind and heart of each viewer pictures can serve as natural bridges for accessing exploring and communicating about feelings and memories
8103149 the most beautiful thing is to see a person smiling and even more beautiful is knowing that you are the reason behind it
8103150 happiness is not what you take its what you give
8103151 life does not have to be perfect to be wonderful
8103152 memory is a way of holding on to the things you love and the things you are the things they you never want to lose
8103153 i may not have everything i want in life but i have everything i need
8103154 above all else it was about leaving a mark that i existed i was hungry i was defeated i was happy i was sad i was in love i was afraid i was hopeful i had an idea and had a good purpose and thats why i made works of art

8103164 the company has decided that for this next critical stage of the age we would have fresh editorial and executive leadership
8103165 i wish to report that andrew jaspan will no longer be editor in chief
8103166 i will come and bid my adieu on the floor at 12noon
8103167 there will be reviews of operating production and support processes in all areas including editorial to ensure optimal employment of staff and technology and including outsourcing of elements that will not impact our quality position
8103168 as a result of this program a number of positions will likely be declared redundant
8103169 you would have noticed that the metropolitan mastheads financial position had declined
8103170 he has our thanks and appreciation for all he has achieved in the past four years
8103171 discussing with andrew the ways his skills and expertise can be made available within the company
8103172 i cant say its something that excites me that they had to do the next step as the commissioner is for me to help raise the limits
8103173 we had to explain to them that this is the direction the university is headed we lost three or four guys that were major contributors for us
8103174 we had a good team we felt last year and we were really young
8103175 but with the new schools and new schedule were going to have to play really well just to have the same record we had its definitely ramped up the competition

8103177 you dont have to wait for a developer to think of a user case you can do it for yourself
8103178 such a call is against righteousness a muslim should thank almighty allah if his children are healthy and if his married life is stable as the years pass by he should say alhamdu lillah for his generosity and kindness
8103179 it is normal for a son or daughter to celebrate birthdays they can invite their friends for a meal on this occasion i see nothing wrong in this
8103180 although he is a very learned scholar sheikh al oadah has made a mistake here
8103181 when we celebrate birthdays and wedding anniversaries we are imitating other religions something that our prophet peace be upon him warned us against
8103182 otherwise we will be falling in the trap of imitating others something that the prophet muhammad peace be upon him warned us against
8103183 we are prevented by islam to liken ourselves to the nonbelievers
8103184 singling out a certain day for celebration of such occasions every year is totally against islam

8103196 do we have a base of public understanding that will with resolute leadership sustain such a policy
8103197 indeed i believe the american people stand ready for far more visionary change than the current administration bush senior is capable of providing

8103201 you can make it whatever you like if you dont like something you can change it
8103202 but the kids never surprise me with their creativity they always come up with interesting things
8103203 you can take clips from other songs and mix them to create a new one
8103204 or you can record stuff onto it and mix your own songs
8103205 it was the most beautiful thing it was just incredible
8103206 the art that went into it and the creativity it brings tears to your eyes sometimes the things that these kids can create
8103207 i really enjoyed editing it was fun to learn and play with imovie
8103208 he would change the display so it would look totally different it would be reformatted and have different graphics and hed download software

8103214 we know this is a watershed time sixth seventh eighth grades and you dont want to get it into anybodys head that they cant do that technology
8103215 i love it when they first discover that they can make it a character move where they want it to go
8103216 its like im in control and how many people can say that about our lives
8103217 we need to understand that we have important relationships with video games one of them is as a teacher if we play an educational game they are natural teachers all games are natural teachers regardless of whether they are intended to be
8103218 i think we need to think about what are the implications we want to open up the conversation
8103219 games provide very rich experiences in which to begin a conversation with kids about all kinds of issues
8103220 they allow kids to try on all kinds of identities and they put kids in a position where they really have to think through the consequences of their actions which is something a kid may not think about in their everyday world
8103221 once our personal connection to what is wrong becomes clear then we have to choose we can go on as before recognizing our dishonesty and living with it the best we can or we can begin the effort to change the way we think and live

8103224 all computer systems old and new have glitches and as i say they have been infrequent
8103225 the cfos claim that the problems with the system can be attributed to poor familiarity is rubbish its got real usability issues the other issue is that it keeps crashing
8103226 these kids all have a lot of passion for what they do
8103227 its real hands on so a lot of them dont realize that theyre learning
8103228 which is really cool because some of them will go on and they will be professional video game creators
8103229 hai orang orang yang beriman telah diwajibkan kepadamu berpuasa sebagaimana telah diwajibkan atas orang orang sebelum kalian agar kalian menjadi orang orang yang bertakwa
8103230 maka barangsiapa diantara kamu yang sakit atau dalam perjalanan lalu ia berbuka maka wajiblah baginya berpuasa sebanyak hari yang ditinggalkan itu pada hari hari yang lain
8103231 dan wajib bagi orang yang berat menjalankannya jika mereka tidak berpuasa membayar fidyah
8103232 ayat ini adalah rukhsoh bagi orang yang lanjut usia lelaki dan perempuan wanita hamil dan menyusui jika khawatir terhadap anak anaknya maka keduanya boleh berbuka dan memberi makan fidyah
8103233 hr abu daud hal yang sama juga diriwayatkan ibnu umar ra dan tak seorangpun dari sahabat yang menyalahinya al mughni ibnu qudamah 3 80
8103234 wajib bagi orang orang yang berat menjalankannya membayar fidyah yaitu memberi makan orang miskin
8103235 barangsiapa diantara kamu hadir di bulan ramadhan maka hendaklah ia puasa pada bulan itu
8103236 as announced in february the proposed changes are aimed at preventing a large potential revenue loss arising from company issues of debt instruments that are attached to shares
8103237 the concern arises because companies using stapled stock can pay tax deductible interest to shareholders as a substitute for dividends which becomes a revenue problem when foreign shareholders are involved
8103238 under current law the debt part of these instruments can be treated as debt for tax purposes making the interest deductible which is often at odds with the way the debt component is treated for accounting and regulatory purposes
8103239 as a result of consultation on the technical details of the proposed legislation the government has narrowed its scope so that it better targets the arrangements that gave rise to our concerns
8103240 the changes will be limited to arrangements involving ordinary shares or shares that are not fixed rate shares and in which the company issuing the debt is a party to the legal stapling arrangements and the debt component is such that it would normally give rise to tax deductible interest
8103241 these stapled instruments will be treated as equity for tax purposes and the company that issued them will not be able to claim interest deductions on the returns paid to investors in relation to the debt component the returns paid will instead be treated as dividends for tax purposes
8103242 interested parties will have a further opportunity to express their views on the proposed changes when the finance and expenditure committee invites submissions on the contents of the taxation bill to which the stapled stock amendments have been added
8103243 these changes are a specific response to a specific type of transaction that could have caused substantial revenue loss more generally the use of various types of hybrid instruments that are partly debt and partly equity is increasing with the growing sophistication of financial markets

8103256 you see how much rejection you can take and how you handle it with this type of job
8103257 its a skill for life because people arent going to say yes all the time you need to try and come back with something different to try and get a yes

8103263 if you dont hurry up and make a decision i might actually have depression
8103264 i kept thinking if only i had as much gray hair as joe biden maybe obama would have made a different decision maybe i should have gotten some of that reverse grecian formula
8103265 i hope i dont fall into the usual suspects category
8103266 oh yeah weve got to put him on there hes old faithful just like clockwork every four years
8103267 you were one of the leading spokespersons for hillary now youre one of the leading spokespersons for barack you must have something going for you
8103268 thats absurd jones bill simply makes clear that under state labor and fair employment laws an oddly reasoned 2007 u s supreme court decision interpreting federal law does not apply

8103272 were here to say thank you to hillary and to protest the fraud perpetrated on us by the democratic national committee
8103273 it wasnt a contest it was a foregone conclusion they the dnc leadership just decided that barack obama was going to win
8103274 its going to be the first time since 1976 that i havent voted i just dont trust obama i think hell do more harm than good
8103275 were here to tell the democratic leadership that its not okay to ignore 18 million voices
8103276 i dont trust obama he flip flops all the time we dont know anything about his past how do we know hes not some kind of militant im voting for mccain
8103277 theres a lot of us who feel pissed and angry at the party for the way hillary was treated there was a lot of sexism in the media and the whole process seemed rigged against her
8103278 at the moment i dont know who i am voting for i want to be able to forgive barack obama but what happened to hillary bugs me i dont know though that i could bring myself to vote for a republican
8103279 i was unhappy and upset that she lost but im going to be voting for obama in november
8103280 hes a brilliant leader and we have to have unity in the party to win the election
8103281 im disappointed hurt and angry about hillary but im not deluded
8103282 four more years of a bush presidency under mccain would be a disaster for our country
8103283 ferg is currently stateside with producer ben hillier engineering the new depeche mode album
8103284 i am not appreciative of the official website keeping mum on the new album it kinda feels like being kept out of the loop we deserve more as a devotee i expect devotion
8103285 you may disconsider any information that does not come from the official source even if it has been partially announced or rumoured on any music producers webpage how can i make this even clearer
8103286 it is not like the landline which was only available in some homes or the phone booth which was available in trading centers now everyone can communicate

8103292 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
8103293 they kept the community informed and they looked after the families of people taken into custody
8103294 but they always had holes or were damaged never had we found a whole tomb like this one intact
8103295 i am here tonight as a proud mother and a proud democrat and a proud senator from new york and a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8103296 my freinds it is time to take back a country we love and whether you voted for me or whether you voted for barack the time is now to reunite as a single party with a single purpose
8103297 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8103298 this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8103299 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8103300 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8103301 you can entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience
8103302 i want basic knowledge of how the gaming world works

8103306 lets talk about it this year and well decide how to rotate it
8103307 people you have cared enough to invite to dinner over the years are people who undoubtedly care about you and will understand and if they dont then theyre people you probably shouldnt be having to dinner anyway
8103308 ive been using computers since i was about 2 years old
8103309 theres more to making movies than just editing clips together you have to walk around campus and find places that will be good for a movie
8103310 i learned team building they taught me movie concepts story boarding and how to use editing software
8103311 quit smoking but dont take away the ill gotten gains
8103312 god save me from those who would save me from myself
8103313 hallo why all these cups why cucumber sandwiches why such reckless extravagance in one so young
8103314 i am pleased to hear it i do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit touch it and the bloom is gone
8103315 how thoughtless of me i should have remembered that when one is going to lead an entirely new life one requires regular and wholesome meals
8103316 maturity can always be depended on ripeness can be trusted young women are green ahem i spoke horticulturally my metaphor was drawn from fruits
8103317 you have filled my tea with lumps of sugar and though i asked most distinctly for bread and butter you have given me cake i am known for the gentleness of my disposition and the extraordinary sweetness of my nature but i warn you miss cardew you may go too far
8103318 how you can sit there calmly eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble i cant make out you seem to me to be perfectly heartless
8103319 well i cant eat muffins in an agitated manner the butter would probably get on my cuffs one should always eat muffins quite calmly it is the only way to eat them
8103320 i say its perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all under the circumstances
8103321 when i am in trouble eating is the only thing that consoles me indeed when i am in really great trouble as anyone who knows me intimately will tell you i refuse everything except food and drink at the present moment i am eating muffins because i am unhappy besides im particularly fond of muffins
8103322 you see instead of going to wall street barack had gone to work in neighborhoods devastated when steel plants shut down and jobs dried up and hed been invited back to speak to people from those neighborhoods about how to rebuild their community
8103323 and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much thats why i left a job at a law firm for a career in public service working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities because i believe that each of us no matter what our age or background or walk of life each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation
8103324 by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills
8103325 as much as john mccain would like us to believe hes different his economic plan offers not a single new idea just more of the same
8103326 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8103327 the republicans are not going to run this convention and cnn is not going to run this convention
8103328 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8103329 we set out last night to make sure that america knew that michelle obama was going to be the kind of first lady that they could all be proud of and that was a lot like them
8103330 all this stuff about mccain and this hitting back hard enough thats all political blah blah
8103331 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8103332 i think that senator obama has tried to run a campaign of not attacking and of not polarizing the country and it has worked for him so far going down the road i dont know whether he needs to do more attacking and red meat or not but i will say that he has an expert in eating red meat in joe biden so im not worried about it
8103333 even john mccain concedes that we are worse off than we were four years ago
8103334 but you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8103335 received a clear calling from the lord to do something about abortion in knoxville

8103357 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8103358 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state

8103389 if you have a place like a mall you could install an elevator for the elderly and the disabled and tell everyone else to take a walk its not the kind of machine that you can make practical because its not
8103390 our company has to customize each job so theres never a set price
8103391 the installation can cost anywhere from 150 000 to half a million depending on the size type and model you want the maintenance all depends on what service you use

8103397 it can be difficult to persuade people of the moral argument behind recycling but when a business realises that it will affect them financially they are likely to respond
8103398 legislation is getting tighter if they want to prepare their business for the future they should get arrangements in place for recycling as soon as possible
8103399 a waste volume is agreed before we sign the contract
8103400 if the trade contractor goes over that they pay for the waste the key is to prevent waste from coming to site in the first place by reducing packaging and working with trade contractors segregation and waste management should be the last link in the chain

8103417 the smart car has been an icon since it rolled off the assembly line in 1998 they appeal to all segments of the population and when the rally and photo shoot idea came up from our northern california chapter it truly felt like the perfect event for all smart owners to participate in and to really mark the first success point for the smart car here in the united states during this introductory year of the smart car to the us marketplace
8103418 with tremendous feedback and excitement around the smarts on lombard event smart car of america plans to continue the rally on an annual basis selecting different locations each year with the unbelievable turnout tripling early estimates its evident that the american public and auto enthusiast are opening their arms to the smart car in america and we plan to continue spreading the new found enjoyment around this great car

8103466 in the stead and by the command of my lord jesus christ i forgive you all your sins in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit go in peace
8103467 and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus

8103480 apa yang berlaku sekarang harus dijadikan pengajaran agar kedua dua pihak dapat dibawa ke pengadilan dan apabila satu pihak merasakan bahawa dirinya tidak terbela atau teraniaya maka muhabalah boleh dilakukan dengan melibatkan kedua dua pihak berkenaan

8103514 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
8103515 what would we have to pay you to get you to come back
8103516 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8103517 like many other citizens of this nation i was shocked to learn that the speaker of the house of representatives of the united states of america would make the kind of statements that were made to mr tom brokaw of nbc tv on sunday august 24 2008
8103518 what the speaker had to say about theologians and their positions regarding abortion was not only misinformed it was also and especially utterly incredible in this day and age
8103519 marvelous beings manifestly clearly and obviously are as they smile and wave into the world outside the womb
8103520 in simplest terms they are human beings with an inalienable right to live a right that the speaker of the house of representatives is bound to defend at all costs for the most basic of ethical reasons they are not parts of their mothers and what they are depends not at all upon the opinions of theologians of any faith
8103521 anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being chooses to do so or for any other equally ridiculous reason should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
8103522 nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8103523 the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8103524 the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops
8103525 given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8103526 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8103527 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
8103528 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8103529 its my fault we missed free throws its my fault we lost both games blame me its my fault we fouled to tie the game up thats my fault its my fault they get easy layups its my fault were not executing well on the offensive end its my fault a couple people in the stands ordered heinekens and they got budweiser its my fault im sorry

8103543 we dont burn our cars we dont burn down our houses
8103544 i would agree with kirk if he were talking about age of conan however my understanding is that war will actually have
8103545 the idea of doing games that could compete with world of warcraft is something that i think a lot of people would say geez you shouldnt do that if our developers come up with the next great game that they want to make and its an mmo then well do that we would go about trying to make the best mmo of all time and to try to eclipse world of warcraft
8103546 at some point some products going to come along and cannibalize the world of warcraft player base and if its going to happen itd be better for us to cannibalize our own player base compared to having another publisher do it
8103547 our hope is that starcraft ii and diablo iii will be games that can be enjoyed by our fans simultaneously with world of warcraft
8103548 i think that there will be a little bit less time between product releases but well continue to take our time to make sure that theyre right i dont think our development cycles will shrink on any of the projects that are going on it would just be that theres more product flow
8103549 people in wow do things for the reward if there is no reward than people wont do them
8103550 shard systems are crap and once people finish getting their gear the incentive for returning is gone and the zones die bad pvpers know this good pvpers know this and blizzard knows it when there is no other incentive besides a small amount of gear fighting gets repetitive siege or not there is no real sense of power control or domination that is exactly what is needed for players to actually want to compete and continue doing so months later
8103551 one of the reasons that the arena is remotely successful is that with the improved ratings you now have a means of distinguishing your talent from other players
8103552 must pay 50 000 if used longer than 6 months
8103553 as an initial matter the court concludes that limitations on the license granted by blizzard may be found in both the eula and the tou these contracts must therefore be read together
8103554 when the eula and tou are considered in their entirety the court concludes that section 4 of the tou titled limitations on your use of the service establishes limitations on the scope of the license and section 5 titled rules of conduct sets rules of the game as independent contract terms

8103562 we have always said that we will enter into dialogue with any country or any person on a constructive basis
8103563 the nature of that evidence appears inconsistent with the evidence given by mr peters and his lawyer brian henry the committee has also received a statement in response from the right honourable winston peters
8103564 if it were to come out that in fact owen glenns account is the accurate account that is winston peters approached owen glenn for the money when you add that with the fact that winston denied it very very publicly i think he really cant stay as foreign minister at that point

8103570 i hope i do so people like me and think i actually like my school
8103571 school service is a lot more important than just going to games having a crummy looking school means having crummy spirit
8103572 while going to games is cool theyre more of a social thing and not every one goes to have a nice time
8103573 i think its the excitement that someone feels when a big rivalry comes to a head and the teams are neck and neck but the thing is that kind of pep needs to be seen not just at all football games but also other sports
8103574 it may not be conventional but i think the people who tailgate after school before a game and paint themselves completely
8103575 i think it has potential but we need a lot of people to help out to just have everybody contribute would really help out
8103576 i think going to games painting yourself and attending pep rallies in the morning is school spirit
8103577 school service is what is right not what is right for farragut
8103578 yes because helping out the school is good and more people should do it
8103579 the admiral navy because it actually goes to all the games not just home but away and though most members participate more people should get involved
8103580 in the next several months or even the next year i would say the unfolding credit situation that customers are facing in dealerships will take center stage

8103585 ive had a lot of trouble with other services but yours just works no more headaches trying to find that one movie that no one seems to have thanks guys
8103586 you cant beat the convenience its so much easier than driving to the video store thanks guys youve made my day that much better
8103587 my dog chewed up a couple of my brand new dvds i thought my weekend was doomed to boredom but then i signed up to your service and now things are looking good again
8103588 the downfall of the bigger cars was that they were forced to stop so often so while they kept overtaking us we eventually went past them at the next petrol station when they needed to fill up again
8103589 we kept at a decent speed and still averaged around 35 miles per gallon
8103590 i think we know from the beginning by looking at the numbers that we have some academically disadvantaged and challenged kids
8103591 theres no question about it but we believe we have the necessary support to allow them to be successful or they wouldnt be here
8103592 last year was the first year of the program and we saw that the kids who came into the bridge both athletes and non athletes did really well
8103593 were really trying to enhance the programs like this to help at risk students and provide that extra support
8103594 im not hung up on that obviously i will be hung up about the graduation success rate and we need to make sure that everybody that comes here will have the chance to graduate
8103595 when youre 1 11 you know you put yourself in a position where your talent pool is not as great thats just reality
8103596 we know statistically that junior college kids dont always succeed academically and thats our biggest concern
8103597 our coach knows that and our staff knows that but i think the reality is that when youre 1 11 youre looking for some immediate improvement in certain positions
8103598 the more successful we get athletically i think the larger pool well get of better athletes

8103606 theyve forgotten about us when weve been in business for so many more years
8103607 it was taken for granted that everything about the old new orleans should be erased and replaced with something shiny and new

8103628 the planes pilot has indicated that the hijackers who number 10 or maybe more have said they belong to the sudanese liberation army of abdel wahid mohammed nur
8103629 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8103630 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation

8103724 identity theft inflicts severe financial damage and emotional distress and can ruin a consumers reputation this is the first time a comprehensive solution is available to consumers to detect and prevent identity theft
8103725 many consumers believe they can protect against identity theft by periodically monitoring their credit but a credit report can only tell you if fraud has already occurred idwatch is a proactive solution delivering real time alerts if potentially fraudulent activity is detected it also offers insurance coverage and an expert advisor to help reverse the effects of identity theft consumers need to actively protect their good name and idwatch provides the best defense available
8103726 identity theft is one of the greatest personal disasters that can happen to a consumer
8103727 when a person loses their identity they often lose the ability to borrow to buy and often even to pay bills in most cases it isnt even the consumers fault while consumer training is important it simply cant address a threat increasingly driven by organized crime idwatch is a critical tool because unlike most others it works proactively to identify pending theft before it occurs while nothing is 100 percent the best kind of insurance is always that which works to prevent the problem in the first place and intelius idwatch represents the best kind of insurance against identity theft

8103736 i have to make sure that claims made by one branch of government do not violate the powers of the other two branches
8103737 due to the specific issues involved in this case we would not be able to raise defenses that could conflict with the powers of my other two clients the legislative and judicial branches
8103738 neither the legislative nor judicial branches are parties to the lawsuit so it is absurd for jim hood to suggest some sort of conflict as his reason for begging off the case
8103739 good lawyers do not turn their backs on their clients at the last minute but this is not the first time attorney general hood has done so since ive been governor it is a shame the taxpayers of mississippi will have to pay extra to be represented because jim hood has changed his mind again about who he represents
8103740 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program

8103794 woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous 30 saying if we had lived in the days of our fathers we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets 31 thus you witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets 32 fill up then the measure of your fathers

8103801 weve got to get a democrat in the white house so people can have health coverage
8103802 im so excited to be able to vote for her
8103803 it honors all the women who fought for equal rights for equal pay and for the vote
8103804 we call these people reagan democrats or the white working class clearly some are not going to vote for obama
8103805 as a republican i stand before you with deep respect for the history and traditions of my political party but it is clear to all americans that something is out of kilter in our great republic seldom has the case for an inspiring new political ethic been more compelling and seldom has an emerging leader so matched the needs of the moment i stand before you proud of my partys contributions to american history but as a citizen proud as well of the good judgment of good people in this good party in nominating a transcending candidate an individual whom i am convinced will recapture the american dream and be a truly great president the senator from abraham lincolns state barack obama this is not a time for politics as usual obama will recapture the american dream and be a truly great president
8103806 our voters took the lead in passing renewable energy standards at the ballot box

8103808 were seeing a change in culture from one of conspicuous consumption to conspicuous conservation
8103809 right now were paying for both sides of the war on terror
8103810 john mccain missed the vote but sent word that if he had been there he would have voted against the change
8103811 americans make better consumers than monks and nuns we need to align market incentives to reward conservation

8103814 america has never been afraid of the future and we shouldnt start now
8103815 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8103816 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever because he thinks americans overall are better off thanks to president bush
8103817 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home
8103818 well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8103819 the bush mccain republicans inherited the strongest economy in history and drove it into a ditch we cant afford four more years of deficit and debt drift and desperation not four more years four more months
8103820 over the last eight years your lives are less secure those are the facts and john mccain is not promising to do anything different than george bush did
8103821 weve got to start smacking back in short understandable bites
8103822 everybody is nervous as all get out everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10 15 points what the heck is going on
8103823 not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8103824 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8103825 and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8103826 not ready 08 a mile high and an inch deep
8103827 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president of the united states of america
8103828 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8103829 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8103830 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8103831 didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted
8103832 can you make me a super fancy super froofy fruity drink with no alcohol
8103833 some old people with canes who claimed they had a reservation
8103834 you dont realize how much food you eat until youre buying it
8103835 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
8103836 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
8103837 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
8103838 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
8103839 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
8103840 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
8103841 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
8103842 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
8103843 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
8103844 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
8103845 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
8103846 i wouldnt feel comfortable as a student at a school with teachers that carry guns unless it was police academy or military academy
8103847 hantu dan jin wujud secara tidak nyata kerana tidak terikat kepada jisim graviti bumi serta bebas daripada ikatan karbon molekul dan zarah berbeza dengan manusia yang terbentuk daripada partikel halus atom atau unsur yang menyusun semua benda
8103848 hantu dan jin bagaimanapun termasuk dalam ghaib nisbi dan boleh diukur menggunakan gelombang bunyi dan gema
8103849 apabila keadaan ini berlaku pesakit pergi membuat pemeriksaan doktor tetapi doktor mengesahkan tiada kuman atau bakteria yang menyebabkan kecederaan dan pesakit adalah normal tetapi pesakit berasa sakit ini adalah antara tanda gangguan jin
8103850 bagi saya gangguan hantu tidak berbahaya jika dapat dirawat pada peringkat awal
8103851 walaupun pada peringkat awal rasukan tubuh pesakit seperti menjadi medan pertempuran untuk mengusir hantu yang menyelinap ke dalam ruang tubuh tersembunyi namun akhirnya keadaan akan kembali seperti asal
8103852 sebaiknya untuk merawat rasukan hanya sapukan air sejuk atau ais yang akan memberi keseimbangan semula melalui rakaman gelombang infrasonik yang bersamaan dengan frekuensi doa yang ikhlas ia sudah cukup untuk mengeluarkan gelombang hantu serta mengembalikan ruang dan masa pada tubuh mangsa
8103853 banyak kes rawatan yang saya jalankan menemui pelbagai benda asing pelik seperti habuk kayu kala jengking dan permata terkeluar secara ghaib apabila gelombang dimasukkan ke dalam badan mangsa malah ketumbuhan yang terjadi pada organ juga ghaib apabila gelombang berfrekuensi rendah dirakamkan ke dalam air mandiannya
8103854 kami menciptakan alat radionik iaitu teknologi merakamkan 99 frekuensi gelombang berdasarkan 99 getaran tenaga atom di dalam sukros dan pesakit hanya perlu memakan pil itu secara berterusan untuk memancarkan gelombang ke dalam badan
8103855 besi pula mampu memerangkap gelombang buruk dan hantu tidak menyukai medan elektrik jadi konsep hantu ditembak dengan elektrik untuk dicederakan dan disimpan dalam kotak besi seperti filem ghostbuster adalah benar
8103856 begitu juga amalan meletakkan gunting besi berhampiran mayat kerana besi mampu memerangkap atau menarik muatan elektrik bercas positif yang terhasil apabila seseorang itu meninggal dunia
8103857 cermin pula mampu menyerap cahaya termasuk gelombang elektromagnetik yang mempunyai kesan radiasi yang mencemarkan keadaan ini akan menghindarkan hantu dan jin yang gemar menimbulkan perkara yang tidak diingini perkara seperti ini bukan kurafat tetapi kita perlu memahami konsepnya
8103858 hantu juga terbentuk daripada ion positif dan apabila ion positif bertemu dengan ion positif dalam kesatuan tenaga elektrik ia mampu mencederakan atau menghindarkan mereka

8103867 the us is the biggest single contributor to the uk tourist industry but the number of visitors from america and how much they spend here has been in decline as the strong pound pushed potential holidaymakers towards cheaper emerging economies such as india and china in 2006 there were 3 9 million us visitors to the uk spending 2 9bn last year this was down to 3 6 million tourists spending 2 6bn

8103870 theres a coterie of obama supporters who think hes a racist and the obama campaign didnt do too much to knock that idea down
8103871 nothing to do with what is going on right now
8103872 i am certain it was discussed between barack and joe because it really is a question as to whether someone who has been an independent agent as a senator for so many decades can now work with or for a president
8103873 hell be someone deeply involved in the decision making and in making certain that the policies are successful i dont think joe would have taken it any other way
8103874 i watched joe carefully and he made a conscious effort not to endorse until hillary clinton had withdrawn
8103875 i thought at the time if joe biden were considering the vice presidency it was a wise move it left him in a position of being a bridge to the clinton people who might not otherwise come around

8103886 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it

8103890 i dont know about you but thats not just right
8103891 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8103892 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8103893 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8103894 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8103895 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8103896 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama

8103899 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8103900 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8103901 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8103902 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8103903 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8103904 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8103905 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8103906 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8103907 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8103908 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8103909 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8103910 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8103911 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8103912 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8103923 complaining about and pointing out the obvious truth that men are bossy aggressive hostile and needy makes me feel bad about myself and makes me want to punch someone preferably someone female who wont hurt much if she punches back
8103924 saya tidak ingin anak saya menjadi gay jadi saya ingin tahu mengenai dunia mereka
8103925 ceritanya unik dan menarik ini yang membuat saya tertarik memerankan samsudin sang gay
8103926 tokoh ini pada dasarnya bukan gay namun dia menjadi gay karena selama hidupnya setelah menikah dikekang oleh kecemburuan istrinya yang tidak menentu
8103927 jangankan bicara sama perempuan melirik wanita saja tidak boleh baik itu dirumah dijalan bahkan dalam pekerjaan
8103928 akhirnya karena tokoh ini tidak pernah bergaul dengan wanita setiap hari bergaul dengan pria timbullah hasratnya kepada pria apalagi ternyata istrinya tidak mengerti dan terkadang menolak hasrat suami yang libidonya ternyata cukup tinggi
8103929 the surgery went well the knee looked good the prognosis is very very optimistic for a full recovery
8103930 when you look at it from their standpoint we have a bunch of guys at the wide receiver spot
8103931 and we have guys out there on special teams i will lend my knowledge for the time until i can get back out there on the field
8103932 a really really really fine young guy just a very enjoyable young man to be around
8103933 and very sincere he had a difficult time with it we had a difficult time telling him and we all wish him the best
8103934 the surgery went well the knee looked good the prognosis is very very optimistic for a full recovery
8103935 when you look at it from their standpoint we have a bunch of guys at the wide receiver spot
8103936 and we have guys out there on special teams i will lend my knowledge for the time until i can get back out there on the field
8103937 a really really really fine young guy just a very enjoyable young man to be around
8103938 and very sincere he had a difficult time with it we had a difficult time telling him and we all wish him the best
8103939 he worked really hard studied hard and gave effort every day i think with anybody thats released at this time the one thing that you always talk to them about is just because it didnt work out here doesnt mean its not going to work out for you and you need to keep pursuing your dream and your passion its just not going to work out here right now ive seen so many guys move to different spots and it fits better and it works out great for them
8103940 at the last preseason game as being able to evaluate individuals as opposed to the team and its really important from that perspective
8103941 he worked really hard studied hard and gave effort every day i think with anybody thats released at this time the one thing that you always talk to them about is just because it didnt work out here doesnt mean its not going to work out for you and you need to keep pursuing your dream and your passion its just not going to work out here right now ive seen so many guys move to different spots and it fits better and it works out great for them
8103942 at the last preseason game as being able to evaluate individuals as opposed to the team and its really important from that perspective
8103943 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8103944 and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8103945 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8103946 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8103947 race for the future and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8103948 two wars a warming planet an energy policy that says lets borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us how many people look at these things and wonder what the future holds for them their children their country how many
8103949 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8103950 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8103951 thats why we must elect barack obama as our next president
8103952 because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemates and when hope replaces fear
8103953 this election comes down to a simple question do we want four more years of bush mccain or do we want the change we need
8103954 let big oil determine and even write our national energy policy
8103955 for the last eight years the bush cheney team stonewalled the taxing of oil company profits and prevented efforts to promote alternative energy production and guess who voted with the bush administration 90 percent of the time john mccain
8103956 if there were an olympics for misleading mismanaging and misappropriating this administration would take the gold
8103957 this administration can tap our phones they cant tap our creative spirit
8103958 up with obama biden wake up america wake up america wake up america
8103959 once in a lifetime the poet said once in a lifetime hope and history meet in one extraordinary man i thank the good lord that i have lived long enough to meet and help such a man twice in my lifetime john kennedy and barack obama

8103985 traveling around pennsylvania and looking around this room i have no doubt that is exactly what were going to do so now let us work together with a leader who as lincoln said appeals to the better angels of our nature barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him

8103991 tim roemer former congressman from indiana who sits sen barack obama s catholic advisory council praised the democratic platform on abortion and john hunter spoke on prisoner re entry into the population
8103992 i m honored to deliver the closing prayer at the dnc evangelical voices have been scarce within this party perhaps since the carter administration but as strides are being made on key issues of sanctity of life and social justice as well as peaceful solutions to world conflicts more and more evangelicals are taking a closer look at options the democratic party are beginning to deliver there is a long way to go but sending a message to washington that no single party has the christian community in their pocket thus causing each party to carefully consider the issues most important to us is in my opinion a positive evolution i am glad that for the most part the dialogue has been constructive and positive will you join me in keeping the conversation thoughtful and not reactionary

8104004 but are there enough sufficiently hot bi sexual bitches out there for us to study
8104005 there seems to be a mysterious paucity of pornified bimbos out there willing to perform hot three ways with their girlfriends if my own experience is any indication
8104006 lets do a study where we show hot lesbo porn and hot straight porn to a bunch of girls and see how many of them show arousal at both
8104007 why not some studies that examine why sex with dignity and love is actually not arousing while sex that is degrading is and how did we learn to be aroused at what arouses us
8104008 male sexuality according to studies is less bisexual than female

8104083 one of the ways we can reduce the incidence and death rate from cervical cancer is to encourage all women who have ever had sex to participate in regular two yearly pap smears
8104084 this includes those who have been immunised with the new human papilloma virus hpv vaccine as the vaccine does not protect against all types of the cancer causing virus

8104089 solar cells are electronics with chemistry so theyre a natural market for a chemical company like us to target aggressively
8104090 venture companies cant match the volume production capability of a major integrated chemical producer like mitsubishi
8104091 because roll to roll printing technology is necessary our rivals will be not the current solar cell makers but the big chemical and printing companies
8104092 the main competition looks like it will not be from the u s but rather from china and india
8104093 our target date for volume production was 2012 but in order to move that up weve decided to invest an additional us 14 million
8104094 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8104095 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8104096 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8104097 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8104098 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8104099 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8104100 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8104101 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8104102 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8104103 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8104104 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8104105 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8104106 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8104107 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8104108 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8104109 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8104110 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8104111 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8104112 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8104113 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8104114 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8104115 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8104116 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8104117 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8104118 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner

8104122 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8104123 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8104124 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8104125 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8104126 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8104127 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8104128 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8104129 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8104130 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8104131 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8104132 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8104133 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8104134 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8104135 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8104136 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing
8104137 i want to lift the veil of secrecy thats surrounded the plans thus far because there is absolutely no way that the busselton community has been provided with open access to information in relation to the deal over the last couple of years
8104138 my strong view as a local mp is that we have to do everything we can to save the jetty
8104139 there is no need to link redevelopment of the jetty to redevelopment of the foreshore it just creates unnecessary complications
8104140 not only will this free the jetty restoration from delays and impositions related to land sales the community would also be given the opportunity to properly identify more suitable parcels of crown land to make available for sale
8104141 the other thing that this does is break the link between the restoration of the jetty and the development of churchill park which will be dealt with as a stand alone issue
8104142 we just need to put a halt to that process at the moment work through a whole variety of issues in relation to churchill park and then as a community decide where we want to head
8104143 there are many aspects to it that require detailed consideration in comparison to the state governments offer
8104144 the applicant has the right to lodge an appeal and that right is respected
8104145 the reasons given by canal rocks pty ltd in support of their decision to appeal are inflammatory and unjustified
8104146 theyre trying to create a picture of a development which has been solely delayed by the shire since 2005 and my comment is that this is just ludicrous
8104147 it is with regret that we now refer the project to the state administrative tribunal for a truly independent assessment
8104148 we decided there was no option in the light of advice from various approval agencies that they were all waiting on each other prior to making decisions
8104149 we are locked in a catch 22 situation and the sat is the only circuit breaker available
8104150 sbag are appalled that the developers have used a flimsy excuse to avoid the harsh reality of an adverse report from the independent auditors
8104151 however the sbag is not surprised at this tactic as it expected this would happen when the developers originally insisted that an independent auditor be appointed to write a report on the public submissions
8104152 the sbag expressed opposition at the time to the developers request and confidence in the ability of the shire staff to provide an unbiased and independent report in a timely fashion
8104153 the fact remains that over 8000 written submissions were lodged with the shire and we believe that more than 6000 are opposed to the development
8104154 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
8104155 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand
8104156 every discipline every human and material resource that we dedicate to sport
8104157 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
8104158 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8104159 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8104160 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8104161 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8104162 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8104163 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8104164 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8104165 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8104166 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8104167 amazon closely records our taste in books gmail scans our emails to deliver relevant ads and electronic tolls track where we drive profiles on myspace and facebook are accessible forever the disclosure that judge bork liked to rent british comedies seems quaint in comparison
8104168 we have been working on ways to overcome the functionalization bottleneck in sensing and instead of trying to see a molecule by using photons or electrons as in optical spectroscopy or electron microscopy we have been using vibrational energy exchange to in effect listen to the vibrations of the molecule
8104169 the concept is much like bringing a set of nano tuning forks up to a molecule and seeing which ones become excited those would form a chord of notes that are unique to that particular molecule thus the molecule can be identified
8104170 the scientific core of our work is aimed at utilizing the unique way in which mechanical energy in other words heat is exchanged at the nanoscale
8104171 specifically we have shown that if one nanoscale object vibrates at the same frequency as another in resonance then it is possible for these two objects to exchange heat extremely efficiently at the same time if they are not vibrating at the same frequency then the flow of heat is blocked and little or no energy is exchanged
8104172 nanomechanical energy transfer and resonance effects in single walled carbon nanotubes
8104173 nanomechanical resonance spectroscopy a novel route to ultrasensitive label free detection
8104174 there are other researchers who are studying the importance of the frequency dependence of heat in nanostructures for example in thermoelectric materials or in thermally rectifying materials
8104175 however our work is unique by proposing an application that depends solely on frequency dependent phenomena and also by utilizing these phenomena for label free detection
8104176 for example a series of carbon nanotubes of differing length or radius suspended over a trench similar to the strings in a harp alternatively one could pass analytes through holes in graphene membranes or over substrates coated in fullerenes of different radius the design of a practical nrs is more limited by capabilities for detecting the excitation of a vibrational mode than the ability to fabricate nanoscale devices
8104177 with the development of theory for describing heat transport in nanoscale systems and advances in nanoscale fabrication and characterization techniques we are now well equipped to study these phenomena
8104178 as a result we should look forward to the development of more applications that exploit the wave nature of heat

8104181 what martin did diminishes the dignity of a human being you cant just buy or rent life its even worse when someone famous and in the public eye is doing it
8104182 it looks like were slowly starting to pull out of this
8104183 theyre going to have white outfits soon here white plastic outfits im serious
8104184 its no longer the peoples word against the cops or the peoples word against the government video is unbiased
8104185 ever since lindsay got out of rehab and all these people came back into her life things havent been right
8104186 people like samantha ronson dont need to be around lindsay she shouldnt be dragging lindsay around nightclubs who was samantha ronson before lindsay lohan she was nobody she is using her for her own gain all these people have inserted themselves into her life like parasites and its not right im done with them
8104187 whats the big deal a guys got to have some warm place to blow his wad into doesnt he the problem is that it isnt cheap enough if you ask me
8104188 if i was a girl hell id do it in a minute
8104189 its just hypocritical bullshit women not charging for sex hell they make you pay out the ass for dinner and a show and then make you feel like a jerk just because you try to get them to reciprocate with a little blow job or something its nothing but a fuckin racket
8104190 its the worlds oldest profession its just bullshit prohibition and you know that never works they oughta just legalize it and get it over with
8104191 if it was legal just think how cheap it would get
8104192 every whore out there would immediately start charging for it outright instead of just insisting you buy them drinks and dinner it would be a buyers market
8104193 they legalized gambling didnt they and its already legal in nevada hell its just around the corner
8104194 hutang luar negara adalah kecil selaras dengan dasar kerajaan untuk mengurang pinjaman luar negara bagi mengurangkan risiko pertukaran mata wang asing dan mengutamakan pinjaman daripada sumber domestik
8104195 kerajaan persekutuan juga memberi pinjaman kepada syarikat kerajaan kerajaan negeri badan berkanun pihak berkuasa tempatan koperasi serta pelbagai agensi
8104196 sehingga 31 disember 2007 jumlah hutang mereka dengan kerajaan persekutuan adalah sebanyak rm50 8 bilion
8104197 we want the conviction so they will be properly classified
8104198 man this is the most generic thing ive ever seen
8104199 i am concerned about the amount of money the shire has spent on advertisements in the newspaper and sending their staff out into the community on what i consider not to be an exercise in asking for community opinion but in trying to manipulate public opinion to support this project
8104200 there is a business plan that we are lawfully required to produce with accurate information
8104201 we realised later we missed the chance of course we are angry
8104202 we are decent and treat them well so we left we are not paparazzi
8104203 she was very angry by the sound of her voice when she asked the danish media to leave
8104204 i got the impression she did not want to be hassled
8104205 while much of the criticism has been on the grounds that forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly amongst the poorer nations of the world rather than in the production of food for farmed fish little attention has been paid to the amount of forage fish used by the pet food industry

8104213 its hard to think of a single speech that did more
8104214 on a personal level it catapulted this unknown young congressman to the partys nomination on a broader level it redefined the nature of what it meant to be a democrat

8104218 the plan of the roosevelt managers to rush the convention and put over their candidate with a bang failed this morning and after a turbulent all night session and two roll calls the anti roosevelt men fought off a motion to adjourn until this afternoon and the delegates proceeded to a third test of strength a few minutes before the first roll call began at 4 oclock this morning arthur f mullen of nebraska farleys chief of staff told me that roosevelt would receive 675 votes on the first ballot and 763 on the second and that the third would bring him the two thirds needed for nomination
8104219 estuvimos probando un nuevo desarrollo de los motores de rafael balestrini que realmente anduvieron genial ya en la primer tirada se pudo comprobar el avance con respecto a los motores que ten amos antes
8104220 parece muy centrado y motivado y kimi no lo parece tanto
8104221 fue una prueba muy buena porque conseguimos mejorar el andar del auto y despu s de varias vueltas se pudo marcar buenos registros incluso por debajo del tiempo de clasificaci n
8104222 estamos ilusionados con esta modificaci n creemos que vamos a andar bien creo que es importante concretar cambios para buscar nuevos desaf os y era fundamental buscar otro equipo de cualquier manera me voy muy conforme con todo lo que recib del patagonia racing pero ahora estoy enfocado en esta nueva etapa en la que espero poder seguir mejorando en mi rendimiento
8104223 estoy muy contento por esta idea asegur ortelli no estoy compitiendo en top race para poder dedicarle un tiempo a mi familia pero la categor a me encanta y siempre hablo bien de ella disfrut mucho mientras estuve y ahora veo que tiene un nivel espectacular por eso acept la invitaci n de marcos si bien decid correr en dos categor as no descarto si se dan las condiciones volver a hacerlo en tres alg n d a y retornar de lleno al top race
8104224 fueron muy buenas las pruebas en roca porque nos permiti evaluar muchas cosas en una sola jornada y el auto funciono como esper bamos giramos mucho para probar unos amortiguadores nuevos que se comportaron muy bien y quedaran para la carrera adem s trabajamos en puesta a punto con algunos cambios que fue haciendo el equipo en el transcurso del ensayo esperemos en obera poder hacer un buen papel y que el auto nos permita de nuevo ser protagonista
8104225 tenemos que trabajar muy duro y ver si es necesario utilizar o no ese comod n hay que saber si tenemos un problema de fiabilidad
8104226 at this point we believe the consensus opinion among industry professionals is that the next significant hardware refresh is unlikely to occur before 2011 and more likely in 2012
8104227 one possible exception to console timing may be nintendo which could opt to upgrade the wii with faster processing power dvd capability and or greater storage
8104228 im not sure its going to be a typical lifecycle
8104229 in the past weve always had five to six year lifecycles which were sort of forced by someone jumping ahead and using a new piece of technology
8104230 im quite doubtful that such a notion of platform cycles can be applied in the future
8104231 do not even think about telling me what this really is

8104237 el debate p blico est abierto simplemente que el nuestro no es en la pantalla es con la comunidad de sucre con la comunidad de caracas mientras ellos que est n acostumbrados o necesitan de una pantalla jam s han subido el barrio y no conocen los problemas ni lo que est pasando

8104261 me gust mucho y me qued con muchas ganas de estar ya en ober para poder probar el auto en todas su facetas la sensaci n que me transmiti el m gane fue estupenda el auto va muy pegado al piso es muy gil y estoy seguro que doblando tambi n me va a sorprender fue muy bueno poder conocer el power shift la aceleraci n del motor el poder frenante que tiene y sobre todo ver la adquisici n de datos junto a cristian kissling quien nos mostr todo quiero agradecerle a todos los integrantes del equipo y a la gente de renault por esta gran oportunidad
8104262 estoy muy contento con la chance que me dio el renault team la verdad es que poder tripular este auto es fant stico parece un auto de calle por lo firme que va sobre todo cuando prob los frenos y adem s realice maniobra de direcci n sobre la recta el motor es estupendo y no veo la hora de poder manejarlo en un circuito completo todo el equipo nos trat muy bien y deseo agradecerle a toda la gente de renault por fijarse en nosotros para este proyecto

8104300 while we each consider dr aafia siddiquis case it should be stated very clearly that conspiratorial and anti american rhetoric withdrawal from society and other deconstructive responses all serve to separate us from our potential allies those responses will empower both the anti islamic xenophobes along with their counterparts the terrorists
8104301 they wish to view the world from the lenses of the cowards and those who are assimilated into the fabric and culture of the americans as opposed to muslims who openly show their baraah disavowal and hatred for the american government and these are the type of muslims who would never do such a thing even in a position of strength due to their mixed and confused allegiances and its purposes
8104302 yeah but i remember how excited i was when i was chosen at his age
8104303 its already march why would a kid come here so late
8104304 i know a lot about you kurosaki ichigo age 16 parents are isshin kurosaki and karin kurosaki with one sibling kari kurosaki
8104305 do you think killing is justified with a justified reason
8104306 does not really involve me im not going to answer a question like that to a baby
8104307 you ichigo kurosaki are the soon to be 10th captain of the vongola
8104308 the vongola is an organization that handles affairs that disrupt the peace
8104309 why ask me if youre just going to force me
8104310 and this weird new kid was freaked out when he saw this necklace
8104311 he was in the vongola a few years ago he joined when the 9ths captain was inaugurated unfortunately with gokuderas tactics and ways of fighting he caused too much damage and was kicked out
8104312 i dont feel like getting kicked out of school today
8104313 i got you out of it i said that a dear family member died
8104314 well from that match with gokudera im not going to peg you as a fighter yet
8104315 just this whole vongola thing i mean one day im just a kid and now im some sort of captain for a serious hitman organization why was i chosen for this theres probably a hundred other people more suitable for the job then me
8104316 its funny those questions were the ones i was asking the captain before me when i was chosen
8104317 well no by my age i was not like most kids when kids were out playing games with friends i was training my swordsmanship when it snowed i didnt make snowmen and have snowball fights i practiced seeing how many slashes it would take to cut down a tree
8104318 but eventually i learned that all those years of training were not for nothing
8104319 it was when i was walking back from school i saw some little kid get mugged by these two thugs i took them out easily it turned out that was just a test by the vongola and so i was picked to be the next captain
8104320 its like the life of a normal kid unfortunately if one enters something he is not prepared for the water becomes this
8104321 im saying that if you arent fully dedicated for the role as captain then dont risk your life
8104322 right now in a cave a mile from here some drug hoarders are contemplating an escape we are going to stop them
8104323 okay yamamoto shizune cut their transportation down me and ichigo will handle the boss
8104324 in like a second you took down 6 guys with guns with just a sword i mean thats amazing
8104325 it isnt too hard after all ive been a swordsman all my life remember
8104326 i almost died what the hell have i just agreed too but at least with kaien im safe

8104329 trends in u s motor vehicle fatalities gasoline sales and distance driven were examined for 12 months from may 2007 through april 2008 the results show substantial year to year reductions in motor vehicle fatalities during this time period that cannot be fully explained by the reductions in gasoline sales and distance driven this is especially the case for the latest two months examined march and april 2008 here the reductions in motor vehicle fatalities averaged 20 while the reductions in gasoline sales and distance driven were in low single digits consequently it appears that a major shift in driver behavior might be occurring this shift may involve disproportionate reductions in distance driven for more risky driving conditions and for drivers with less income who tend to have higher crash rates as well as possible reductions in speeds as a means of increasing fuel economy should the march and april 2008 trends continue the 2008 annual fatalities would drop to under 40 000 for the first time since 1961
8104330 despite several years of moderate economic growth new york did not gain any ground in key areas of poverty and family incomes new yorkers were just as likely to be poor in 2007 as they were when the last recession in 2001 according to census bureau data released today also the income of the typical new york working age household was no higher in 2007 than in 2001 after adjusting for inflation the number and percentage of new yorkers lacking health insurance decreased significantly from 2000 to 2007 now that the economy is weakening incomes are likely to fall further before they improve according to analysts at the fiscal policy institute

8104372 as the baby boom generation of corporate leaders and experts approaches retirement businesses in the u s canada and many european nations face the loss of experience and knowledge on an unprecedented scale

8104413 this is definitely a good move to try to attract more vaccinations among a group of vulnerable people
8104414 many of these people were slipping through so hopefully this will boost numbers up and send a message that its very important to get immunised
8104415 its more convenient for people to be able to walk straight into a doctors surgery and get immunised and any hurdles we can remove to encourage immunisation the better

8104430 so it was pleasing the way the young guys had a real dig and finished the game strongly
8104431 we knew that every game would be a challenge and leinster have clearly got some world class players but at the end of the day this tours not about going through undefeated its about setting guys up for super 14 in two or three years time so its certainly serving the purpose for us there

8104448 let me be clear weve conducted an intensive investigation chased down numerous leads and carefully reviewed the evidence to date
8104449 it is a very serious federal crime to threaten a presidential candidate in this case however there is insufficient evidence at this time to indicate a true threat plot or conspiracy against senator obama
8104450 reported threats hateful and bigoted though they were involved a group of meth heads methamphetamine abusers all of whom were impaired at the time and they cannot independently be corroborated
8104451 the evidence involving alleged threats does not warrant federal charges but the investigation is ongoing and we are keeping an open mind

8104461 in fact logically you could say that its going to make things worse because youre going to have the family of a truant child slung into even greater poverty and inability to get itself well ordered
8104462 i would have thought this government had more wit and wisdom than to come up with this howard hangover legislation
8104463 ill be looking to see if theres a clause in that bill that says if parliamentarians kids play hookey have their wages stopped until they get the child settled and back into school

8104474 he had a very classy elegant look about him but he also had that soft touch as strong an advocate as henry was for the things he believed in he never came on really strong he worked with you in a very gentle way
8104475 anytime he picked up to call someone for a donation they never said no
8104476 i put that incident in the perspective of all the good he did for the community and i certainly come down on the side of the good
8104477 he was just a dear man he was kind and thoughtful and really cared about his family and the san jose community
8104478 the music is what really kept him going that is really the legacy that allowed him to persevere from that circumstance

8104510 after she was elected to congress and the choice issue became more public as she would have to vote on it she studied the matter more closely
8104511 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view

8104538 nothing is far from god and i need have no fear that he will not know where to find me when he comes to raise me to life at the end of the world
8104539 indeed this is the perfect and complete glorification of god when one does not exult in his own righteousness but recognizing oneself as lacking true righteousness to be justified by faith alone in christ

8104599 well certainly have very few people at most who will lose their housing
8104600 i probably hate to say 100 percent no one will thats unrealistic in the best of times were just going to minimize to the best extent possible people losing their housing
8104601 to sum it up there still will be losses of services but we are doing our best to make lemonade out of lemons
8104602 i honestly look forward to going forward because there is no going back

8104611 given the current track for gustav and the expectation that it might enter the this weekend we are making logistical arrangements to evacuate staff who are not essential to production or drilling operations
8104612 evacuations could begin as early as wednesday there is no impact on production at this time
8104613 many of the perceptions of shopping centres misuse of negotiating power stem from a lack of understanding or acceptance that the business model of a retail shopping centre is fundamentally different from traditional retail strips
8104614 retailers who sign a lease in a large managed shopping centre without realising that the rules of the game are very different are at a disadvantage and can be seriously disappointed if not financially devastated
8104615 it is a very sad day for the retailing sector it seems amazing to me they could say the market is working well they obviously have their heads in the sand
8104616 the productivity commission is basically commercially na ve and making such a deluded finding has damaged its credibility to suggest there is no imbalance between a giant multinational shopping centre owner and a small family business is an absurdity
8104617 there is a monopolistic approach with shopping centres that means tenants cant move out and take their goodwill with them so they have reduced bargaining power in negotiations
8104618 your employee has committed fraud and is about to be arrested
8104619 ordinarily my office protects consumers from fraudulent activities by seeking injunctions in court but legal action cannot be taken until the scam artists can be located even then it is unlikely that the persons behind the fraudulent calls and extortionist threats would obey a court order in this case the consumers best defense is to be armed with the knowledge of the scam so that all demands for money can be resisted despite the false but scarey threats of arrest
8104620 because the fraudsters make a special point of calling consumers repeatedly at work employers must understand that the consumers are innocent victims of a criminal enterprise and cannot stop the calls from coming i also wish to assure the citizens of west virginia that my office will continue to do everything possible to locate and shut down the outlaw debt collectors

8104628 in contradiction to a 60 year assumption in archaeology weve managed to show that neanderthal stone tool technologies are no less efficient in a number of respects thanhomo sapiensstone tool technologies this suggests that neanderthals did not go extinct because of inferior intellect or technology
8104629 i think this study is very important in that it is helping move neanderthals out of that dark box that they have traditionally been confined to
8104630 they are not just dumb limited versions of ourselves but highly advanced very intelligent cousins different does not mean inferior
8104631 theres been a longstanding historical bias against the neanderthals in any number of categories technological prowess hunting prowess intelligence reproductive abilities and success
8104632 the roots of this go back to the nineteenth century and its taken us a long time to shake this bias

8104638 the pilot relayed to the aiport head that the hijackers do not want any negotiations and they have only one demand that the plane be refuelled to go to paris
8104639 the hijackers also rejected the airport request that passengers who had fainted because of inadequate air conditioning in the plane be given medical treatment
8104640 they said they belong to slms abdel wahed nur who lives in paris they had coordinated with him to meet them in the french capital
8104641 we took no part in this hijacking at all it is completely against our aims values and objectives we condemn this hijacking with a strong voice
8104642 the pilot also informed the airport director that the hijackers numbered 10 before he came back to say their number could be more than that
8104643 we had three senior members on the plane and some other people they got on and someone hijacked it

8104647 what happens after that is largely up to my colleagues
8104648 thats been the strength of the company but it is also its weakness because obviously no group of people can go on forever and there has to come a day when the group is no longer a cohesive group because one or more people have gone in other directions
8104649 i think at 20 years it is time for me to set the lead and say to the others you work out what you want to do after that

8104670 id be disappointed if players felt they had to play better because of the situation but those little things do play a little role in the back of players mind and it can be the difference between an outstanding performance and a good performance

8104807 es dif cil de creer que sus padres eran feos
8104808 dear un valued customer you are not important for us you need gia and gia dont need you
8104809 what im wondering about is the association between masculinity and the conquest of nature
8104810 dominion over the earth and all the shit on it
8104811 could it be then that a contributor to male infertility is our failure or refusal to construct a convincing model of male goodness
8104812 i realised that at least i understand jeremy clarkson and by aspiring to be like him i may at least get laid
8104813 steve i think youre holding cultural analysis up to a standard of causality which is outside its domain
8104814 in politics too excepting the nsw parliamentary thug pit men have begun to show feminine traits niceness consultation committee mindedness
8104815 of course since reproductive science like weapon science is largely male driven you might argue that men have rendered themselves and this debate unnecessary by waging war on nature the planet and each other that were now ready for the female century that its fair and its time
8104816 im surprised then that you understand the terms of the argument you claim to refute because if you were actually consistent you wouldnt accept its premises
8104817 al gore has a big house i hear and hes overweight
8104818 or maybe cultivating confusion and polarising the debate are the real motives
8104819 the only thing im willing to do about it is to put aluminium foil all over the place cause like im not going to completely upend the economic system and incidentally my quality of life for this thing
8104820 translation feminism has now achieved all its ends and can now fade away and of course there are no social or cultural differences in masculine and feminine behaviour yet youre not an anti feminist you say
8104821 gender analysis like race analysis is best understood as an inevitable if unpleasant ideological manifestation of an historical epoch that is race analysis coincided with the age of european imperialism in the same way that gender analysis now coincides with greater female equality
8104822 if anythings repeating a gendered set of assumptions that is you may not be conscious of that but your choice of words is anything but neutral
8104823 it would never occur to you to use it except as a provocation i suppose
8104824 of course since reproductive science like weapon science is largely male driven you might argue that men have rendered themselves and this debate unnecessary by waging war on nature the planet and each other that were now ready for the female century that its fair and its time
8104825 of course since reproductive science like weapon science is largely negroid driven you might argue that negroids have rendered themselves and this debate unnecessary by waging war on nature the planet and each other that were now ready for the aryan century that its fair and its time
8104826 it is intriguing that anti gay male homophobia has become acceptable within gender studies
8104827 when the only association is that you dont like feminists
8104828 doesnt it occur to these people to think that unless you say something coherent and intelligible you arent actually communicating
8104829 according to the nature of truth operations in the same way as out of elementary propositions arise their truth functions from truth functions arises a new one every truth operation creates from truth functions of elementary propositions another truth function of elementary propositions i e a proposition the result of every truth operation on the results of truth operations on elementary propositions is also the result of one truth operation on elementary propositions
8104830 thats why i think its interesting to consider climate change denialism as a gendered phenomenon
8104831 in utilizing and conserving the natural resources of the nation the one characteristic more essential than any other is foresight the conservation of our natural resources and their proper use constitute the fundamental problem which underlies almost every other problem of our national life
8104832 steves welcome to disagree with me as are you but going off on some tangent of bashing everything in academia he doesnt like isnt making an argument
8104833 nowhere in the whole creation do i see beings that observe within their lives that moderation natures ruler wished them always to preserve have any done so not a one for better or for worse that never will be done
8104834 i will leave aside the chemistry and physics for now
8104835 and tell you something of my philosophical objections to agw
8104836 the australian val plumwood is a particularly impressive theorist and writer in this field

8104839 you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket but on a lampstand and it gives light to all who are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father in heaven
8104840 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we are all meant to shine as children do we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

8104849 i dont think anybody considers the republic of korea today a combat zone
8104850 north korean soldiers suffer from malnutrition and rarely train due to a scarcity of fuel and ammo
8104851 on the other hand the entire 700 000 man south korean active duty army can be devoted to the defense of korea the modern south korean army is backed by over 5 000 000 well trained reservists who can be called to duty in hours south korea has twice the population of the north thirty times its economic power and spends three times more on its military each year south korean military equipment is first class whereas most of the north korean military equipment is over 30 years old and much is inoperable due to a lack of maintenance if war broke out south korea has a massive industrial capacity and 94 billion in foreign currency reserves to sustain a war while north korea has no industry and no money as a result south korea is roughly five times more powerful than north korea
8104852 our discussions touched on transformation and realignment of u s forces korea measures to increase defense preparedness and south korean plans to increase its defense capabilities in particular we had a good discussion and review of how we plan to transition wartime operational control of republic of korea forces by 2012
8104853 i dont think anybody considers the republic of korea today a combat zone i dont see a reason why our troops in korea should have unaccompanied tours any more
8104854 but as a matter of principle i think it is past time
8104855 as a matter of principle i think its past time
8104856 it communicates that our view of the reality here is that the republic of korea is literally safe enough for our families to be present
8104857 this alliance is strong and enduring it will last through the 21st century and beyond it is time to make this permanent instead of doing it one year at a time
8104858 koreas a great place to be assigned we seek to make this be the dream assignment for soldiers
8104859 the total of americas military bases in other peoples countries in 2005 according to official sources was 737 reflecting massive deployments to iraq and the pursuit of president bushs strategy of preemptive war the trend line for numbers of overseas bases continues to go up
8104860 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
8104861 knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation

8104864 my goal is to provide an alternative not to free the mac os
8104865 what we want to do is to provide an alternative an option its not that people dont want to use mac os many people are open to the idea but theyre not used to spending an exorbitant amount of money on something that is essentially generic hardware
8104866 they are beginning to realize the level in which they need to compete
8104867 a professional organization holding this kind of data should have tested the disks to make sure the information was destroyed
8104868 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines appears to have been inappropriately sold on via a third party
8104869 as a result historical data relating to credit card applications from some of our customers and data from other banks were not removed we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency

8104871 communism is power based upon force and limited to nothing by no kind of law and by absolutely no set rule
8104872 solicitor general ted olson has described the process there is no requirement for the executive branch to spell out its criteria for who qualifies as an illegal combatant
8104873 in other words what is safe to say today might imperil your freedom or your life tomorrow you can never know if you are on the right side of the law because the law is merely whim of the leader and his minions their instincts determine your guilt or innocence and these gut feelings can change from day to day this is now formally and officially the guiding principle of the united states government and underlying this edifice of tyranny is the prerogative of presidential murder
8104874 perhaps the enormity of this monstrous perversion of law and morality has kept it from being fully comprehended it sounds unbelievable to most people but that is our reality to overcome what seems to be widespread cognitive dissonance we need only examine the publicly available record there is nothing that any ordinary citizen could not know if they choose to know it
8104875 bush signed orders allowing cia assassins to kill targets without seeking presidential approval nor is it necessary any longer for the president to approve new names added to the target list the security organs can designate and kill as they see fit there is no way of knowing how many people have been killed by american agents operating outside judicial process most of the assassinations are carried out in secret quietly professionally the death squads are able to operate clandestinely using a full range of official and non official cover arrangements to enter countries surreptitiously
8104876 everything secret degenerates even the administration of justice nothing is safe that does not show it can bear discussion and publicity
8104877 the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them
8104878 god told me to strike at al qaeda and i struck at them and then he instructed me to strike at saddam which i did
8104879 since a human being has no power to create life he has therefore no right to destroy life
8104880 to force a man to pay for the violation of his own liberty is indeed adding insult to injury but that is exactly what the state does read the congressional record follow the proceedings of the state legislatures examine our statute books testing each act separately by the law of equal liberty you will find that a good nine tenths of existing legislation serves not to that fundamental social law but either to prescribe the individuals personal habits or worse to create and sustain commercial industrial financial and proprietary monopolies which deprive labor of a large part of the reward that it would receive in a true free market
8104881 our electoral system is nothing less than a massive influence peddling scheme where both parties conspire to sell the country to the highest bidder
8104882 the senate is a brothel access is sold to special interests they write the bills and we vote for them
8104883 power is evil in itself regardless of who exercises it every dictator plans to rear feed and train his fellow men as the breeder does his cattle
8104884 we will not ask a white man who came to us recently for a piece of land that is already ours and has been ours since time immemorial
8104885 we want a right to live as we please as human beings we want a right to worship as we please and have our own land we dont want someone to plan our lives for us issue us rations social security or any other dole
8104886 self determination is sovereignty of self rule self determination means that a people have the sovereign right tom determine and carry out their own destiny without any authority to say whether their acts are good for them or not under self determination a people have the right to make their own mistakes and be accounted for them the us cannot give self determination to the hopi all it can do is get out of the way for the truth is the hopi want to run their own lives
8104887 the laws of the great spirit must be followed even though they might conflict with other political laws all instructions of the great spirit come from the seed of one basic instruction you must not kill you must love your neighbor as yourself from this one commandment to respect and revere life come all the other commandments to tell the truth to share with others to live together in mutual support to take care of our children and old people the sick and strangers friends and enemies to abstain from intoxicants and adultery not to cheat steal or covet
8104888 the law becomes the weapon of every kind of greed instead of checking crime the law itself is guilty of the evils it is supposed to punish
8104889 government is the only institution in our civilized society that is able to cover its coercion and use of threats of force in a shroud of mystique and legitimacy
8104890 few people would directly confront their neighbors with a demand of
8104891 the state is that great fiction by everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else
8104892 to be governed is to be watched inspected spied upon directed law driven numbered regulated enrolled indoctrinated preached at controlled checked estimated valued censured commanded by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so to be governed is to beat every operation at every transaction noted registered counted taxed stamped measured numbered assessed licensed authorized admonished prevented forbidden reformed corrected punished it is under pretext of public utility and in the name of the public interest to be placed under contribution drilled fleeced exploited monopolized extorted from squeezed hoaxed robbed and then at the slightest resistance the first word of complaint to be repressed fined vilified harassed hunted down abused clubbed disarmed bound choked imprisoned judged condemned deported sacrificed sold betrayed and to crown all mocked ridiculed derided outraged dishonored that is government that is its justice that is its morality

8104901 quando si arriva in finale una squadra vale laltra bisogna lottare essere pronti ad ogni sacrificio fino allultimo noi sappiamo che saranno partite dure e una squadra tosta il san marino
8104902 indubbiamente una strategia che in questo momento sta pagando cio la settimana scorsa stata fondamentale per la eliminazione del grosseto estrada figueroa e looney luno dopo laltro hanno prodotto inning di qualit concedendo pochissimo al lineup maremmano penso che il terzo pitcher straniero estrada sia stato scelto dal san marino per necessit quando figueroa si infortunato poi rientrato figueroa e a san marino hanno deciso di utilizzare tutti e tre ma non sono preoccupato pi di tanto ho fiducia nei miei due lanciatori stranieri soltanto nel caso dovessimo arrivare alla settima partita della serie il san marino potrebbe essere sulla carta avvantaggiato perch leventuale gara7 libera e potrebbero lanciare tutti quanti per una serie di finale va giocata partita per partita senza spingerci troppo oltre con il pensiero
8104903 s al colosseo dove non c vita facile per nessuno
8104904 i problemi ci sono stati come pi o meno ci sono in tutte le squadre
8104905 c stato un periodo in cui carlos era in pericolo si accennava alleventualit di un taglio ma a me come allenatore piace cominciare e finire una stagione con la stessa squadra e il discorso del taglio poi caduto duran allora si tranquillizzato ha preso fiducia ora un giocatore completo e con tanto entusiasmo
8104906 parisi sembra un nettunese vero uno con il nostro spirito non si tira indietro mai capace di soffrire di giocare anche sul dolore e un giocatore che ad altre societ forse non piaciuto ma a me ha sempre dato grandi risposte sul campo e anche sul piano caratteriale limportante fargli capire subito chi comanda
8104907 per quanto riguarda giovanni carrara lui un giocatore particolare o lo si accetta com oppure devi farne a meno nel senso che giovanni ha la sua autonomia gestirlo non semplice per io penso che un campione come lui sempre meglio averlo
8104908 vero il guaio che nella stagione scorsa e anche questanno non ho avuto larias efficacissimo di due anni fa quando stava bene un problema alla spalla ha condizionato pesantemente il suo rendimento nella stagione scorsa in questa aveva iniziato benino e poi ha avuto nuovamente una ricaduta gli ho concesso la partenza sabato a bologna nella partita conclusiva del round robin spero che stia meglio e che possa essere utile al nettuno in queste finali anche per una ripresa o due mi basta
8104909 soprattutto tutti ex compagni di squadra io mastrantonio dauria barboni scerrato cianfriglia abbiamo giocato assieme stesso modo di pensare e di vedere le cose e anche per questo che non ho voluto tecnici stranieri voglio che i giocatori stranieri appena arrivano possano capire in fretta lo spirito del nettuno baseball e integrarsi con facilit nel nostro gruppo
8104910 e la stessa cosa che ho fatto con ambrosino il quale fino ad ora non ha pienamente risposto alle aspettative cosicch ad un certo punto ho preferito puntare su leonardo mazzanti che mi assicura esperienza e mi ha dato delle sicurezze soprattutto in battuta
8104911 comunque non solo renato imperiali e paolino ambrosino stiamo lavorando su ragazzi che ho gi coninciato ad inserire in prima squadra e che potranno essere importanti per il domani del nettuno i vari medoro retrosi catanzani nettuno una grande scuola di baseball il nostro settore giovanile composto da circa 400 ragazzi non per niente nettuno lunica citt ditalia dove il baseball il primo sport in tutti i sensi
8104912 con peppe stato compiuto un lavoro intenso e importante da parte di tutto lo staff tecnico i miglioramenti che mazzanti ha realizzato sono evidentissimi e non sono finiti perch c un lavoro da completare io credo che il miglior giocatore italiano sia ancora claudio liverziani e non lo dico per aver giocato assieme a lui in nazionale io non ho mai visto un giocatore come claudio che non sta in difficolt con nessuno qualsiasi lanciatore abbia davanti e poi mancino completo ma liverziani da tempo che al top delle sue possibilit peppe invece sta continuando la sua grande crescita stiamo cercando di fargli capire ad esempio che importante battere anche in campo opposto questinverno con lui faremo un lavoro speciale a livello difensivo sulla rapidit sui tempi di reazione contro le battute interne
8104913 dal box di battuta quando mette palla a terra lui sta sotto i 4
8104914 s io voglio una squadra intensa viva dinamica aggressiva veloce sulle basi dobbiamo sfruttare ogni situazione favorevole ogni incertezza difensiva degli avversari dobbiamo mettere pressione sulle difese soprattutto quando in battuta le cose non vanno come avevi programmato devi saper variare il tuo gioco devi trovare altre strade per non c soltanto la parte riguardante lattacco sar perch io sono stato principalmente un buon difensore ma a me piace vincere le partite in difesa con grandi giocate
8104915 ga boleh selingkuh ya emang situ ga pernah aku tahu selingkuhanmu cuma satu satu di tiap rt
8104916 they asked her to stay because of the current political uncertainty
8104917 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8104918 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8104919 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in the space of a few weeks
8104920 i think the fact that it seems to be taking several weeks just to have a phone call with opposition leaders i think indicates frankly a much deeper issue and that is that this parliament is increasingly reaching an impasse on a range of issues
8104921 today is an additional episode of a continuing saga of a fabricated emergency by the prime minister
8104922 he wants to meet me and to pretend that the meeting went so badly that he needs to call an election thats what its all about
8104923 now hes saying i want to meet the leaders of the opposition i want them to accept my agenda what is his agenda nobody has any idea of what is his agenda maybe not himself and you want me to agree with it on the phone this is a joke
8104924 its an opportunity for us to showcase our state and tourism and our mountain resorts to a worldwide audience
8104925 we dont have any operations in minneapolis and therefore we didnt make a contribution there
8104926 it was an opportunity to talk to media from all over the world about our resorts and expose more potential guests to our mountain resorts
8104927 vail resorts ceo rob katz actually told the governor he hopes it snows on thursday night
8104928 every industry has to find a way to change and provide natural options and the funeral business is the next low hanging fruit
8104929 the private cemetery regulations that require things like vaults and grave liners serve no purpose for public health and safety theyre for landscaping management maybe we need to start a lobbying effort
8104930 instead of the simple steak potato and broccoli dish were going for more vertical execution using an artichoke as a garnish or filling roasted red peppers with a salad or even using a shot glass to serve soup
8104931 i spent time in nicaragua with coffee buyers trying to assure the beans we buy are organic and im not sure everyone down there goes to the expense and trouble to make sure
8104932 a lot of this boils down to price and its hard to pass higher and higher costs on to your customers im of the theory people have been eating non organic things for a long time and life expectancy still keeps going up
8104933 when you consume ordinary noodles made from wheat or corn you may soon feel your stomach empty but this soybean noodle delays such a feeling of hunger
8104934 its important that this report is done well and that this is done in a way that brings value to a broad group of stakeholders public police and policy makers
8104935 its not risk free but you have to compare it to other types of force
8104936 the issue is not so much the tool as the rhetoric that revolves around it
8104937 in my experience that particular device has saved many lives
8104938 i find that hard to believe but im not discounting anything ill wait for my investigators to provide some preliminary findings to me
8104939 i do want to know immediately if there is a security concern regarding infrastructure
8104940 inmates are pretty ingenious and they do have a lot of time on their hands i understand that we have to look at every possible scenario
8104941 staff will be very critical in this to provide us with some feedback into what happened that night
8104942 i think for the most part the hitters are swinging the bats much better than they were before when i first got here were still a work in progress
8104943 i think there were a couple times when the momentum could have swung the other way
8104944 we managed to pick up runs in those innings as opposed to having a quick inning and keeping the other team in the game
8104945 its a tough team to pitch against it takes its toll i felt like i worked
8104946 actually i think all teams should have domes then you wouldnt have any rainouts personally i really believe that
8104947 the incurable tragedy was inspired by the deaths of tim roths two best friends brothers who succumbed to cancer within two months of one another
8104948 today is the day reddit fully becomes a platform for building link sharing sites
8104949 somewhere between when a caterpillar becomes a butterfly and when six hydrogen nuclei combine to form helium and eventually life as we know it
8104950 our concern is that the process is not an open and official process
8104951 its clear that the rules have changed we submitted a bid that we strongly believed was responsive certainly the process is not well set up
8104952 there are very strict rules around an rfp request for proposal and we communicate with vendors and how vendors communicate with us
8104953 this approach allows for discussion it allows for questions it allows for clarification pick up the phone have a meeting
8104954 ideally an rfp is the best way to go because it is the most open and transparent
8104955 our current fairness commissioner who recommended we cancel the rfp is going to continue to be engaged in this to continue to make sure this process is fair and transparent an rfp is easiest from that perspective and it didnt work so were now going to the negotiated procurement option
8104956 we stand by that what we proposed in section 15 the alternate profile would meet all the safety and operational requirements as well as the other rfp requirements while adhering to industry wide safety standards
8104957 if you want to submit an alternative thats fine but you have to submit a base
8104958 but even the alternative wouldnt have worked theyre saying you could ground the rails and that would cost as little as 10 million we dispute that it would cost far more than that in fact there are over 90 curves on the system that would require a new track structure youd have to expand the loops which means purchasing property
8104959 hey mac they got todd bertuzzi down here yeah that todd bertuzzi
8104960 i really dont have a comment on any of that
8104961 i cant lie to you its not the jersey i always thought i was going to wear
8104962 im well aware i was not the most popular pickup in flames history but at the same time you have to give it a little time give me a chance given time i think i can help this team out i dont think i have to prove anything if anything i have to prove it to myself
8104963 here you cant go five 10 games without a point and no one noticing
8104964 there i think you could fly under the radar a little bit if theyre not yelling obviously im not doing anything out there
8104965 theyre old canadian boys who play a style that i think represents our league and i think i fit into that and can contribute and help i still have a lot of legs left i was just looking for an opportunity
8104966 so far everyones been very respectful and i hope it continues that way especially when my familys around myself thats a different story let my play do the talking its exciting going into buildings when they dont like you if it was the other way it would be pretty boring out there
8104967 its not on my a list of things to do i was young in vancouver and i was put in a position where i was asked a lot of questions day in and day out coming into a team like this youve got craig conroy matthew lombardi robyn regehr dion phaneuf a big cast of guys who get a majority of the media
8104968 my grandmother once told me that if you want to make god laugh tell him your plans
8104969 as finance minister id rather see the whole picture before i start making allocations i might wish we could change
8104970 unallocated is an indication that we want to get another two to three months under our belt a little clearer indication a little more opportunity to talk to our caucus about the savings
8104971 if the prices go down we have opportunities in our capital and perhaps our savings to make some adjustments
8104972 this time we have an opportunity to look slightly differently at the surplus policy
8104973 the difference is that were taking into account a huge and important need for this government to recognize what we needed to do with carbon capture and storage
8104974 if were going to have a bonanza then i think we need to be brave we need to be mavericks we need to save all of the money
8104975 its an enormous slush fund that the government can draw on when they need to quench a political fire
8104976 this is massive massive money and were only talking about 2 5 billion maybe getting saved
8104977 but possession of as little as one seed here can earn you ten years hard labour in a gulag oh and people dont usually survive more than five or six years in gulags here
8104978 yeah right ive been working my tail off and i cant even find 30 people who will listen to my business presentation in a month much less who want to join my business
8104979 this was the most memorable coin i have graded all year
8104980 this is a great selection of coins and this new discovery humbert is one that will be remembered and talked about for years to come
8104981 ive been in this business for 40 plus years now and i know that finds of this magnitude are rare
8104982 when malay youngsters especially boys failed to study and qualify for university education when they preferred to play and not study we cannot expect the non malays to patiently wait and give up their opportunities until the malays decide to become serious and study
8104983 that was why we introduced merit in the selection of students for the universities unfortunately the implementers of government decisions chose to interpret it differently by requiring bumiputeras to sit for the matriculation and the non bumiputeras to sit for higher school certificates they managed to give the impression that the bumiputeras were actually better qualified than the non bumiputeras
8104984 bayar dulu perbelanjaan pelajaran bila lulus barulah boleh claims balik ongkosnya
8104985 the issue of nep nep is a good idea provided that the discrimation is against the well to dos and help is for the poors of all races only
8104986 they would eradicate poverty irrespective of race and that there should be no identification of race with economic function
8104987 like the proverbial butterfly that flaps its wings on one continent and eventually causes a hurricane on another
8104988 yo no entiendo porqu el presidente saca no quiere decir cuanto esta gastando
8104989 snoop dogg trades in toxic messages of menace violence misogyny and lawlessness

8105022 we need to ensure that we learn the lessons of those two events and that we continue to strengthen an integrated process to defend ourselves against these kinds of intrusion
8105023 its critical to our mission that we are comfortable that we have a secure network that its resilient to probes and attacks and that it will be able to sustain good decision making for the nations leaders
8105024 all of those have to come together in a unified effort if we are to maintain adequate defense against those who might intrude to our networks and try to disrupt them its a big challenge
8105025 if you are going to be successful at defending it you have to have strong and close integration among the various agencies
8105026 because this is such a broad area and it touches so many different elements of our society business medical care information certainly military and economic many of those same organizations are struggling with how do you pull them together in a more coherent fashion
8105027 im not as worried that a cold war relationship is returning so much

8105044 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander our promise as a country that really fulfills the hopes of our people

8105089 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
8105090 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
8105091 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
8105092 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
8105093 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
8105094 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
8105095 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
8105096 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
8105097 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
8105098 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
8105099 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose

8105122 the fact that a minister is in his or her job is a statement that i have confidence in them
8105123 obviously this is a matter in front of the privileges committee theres a conflict of evidence the committee is in the middle of a process no doubt theyll wish to hear from mr peters and i think the matters really best left with the privileges committee to pursue at the moment
8105124 i think we really need to see the privileges committee work through the issue
8105125 these are incredibly important issues for our democracy the public have got a right to be reassured about the influence of money over politics and so i am hopeful the privileges committee can get to the bottom of it
8105126 its very clear now that winston peters has misled the public of new zealand

8105224 this civil right the right to keep and bear arms is the right that gives teeth to the peoples power to control the government and every other right bestowed upon them by their creator i will at every opportunity argue that this constitutional provision and the 2nd amendment to the united states constitution should and must be read literally neither provision includes an exception for felons the insane drug addicts foreigners dishonorably discharged veterans or persons who commit domestic violence i encourage oregonians to keep and bear arms when more oregonians defend themselves by keeping and bearing arms there will be less crime with less crime we will need fewer police officers and fewer prisons

8105244 i was recently involved in a business meeting that went sour and threatened to scuttle a good deal what happened was that the chinese party recieving the american purchaser was late in reaching his hotel the american was furious as he had a tight schedule and that they were late and threatened to withdraw his purchase the chinese party was late because they were given a vague address of a lake side hotel you see what happened was that the american gave his hotel as lakeside hotel unfortunately there were numerous hotels along the lake but the chinese were too shy to enquire which lakeside hotel earlier because they were afraid the american would lose face for having given a vague address instead they spent the morning hopping from one lakeside hotel to another looking for this american gentleman

8105345 internet ha rivoluzionato il mondo della comunicazione i giornali presto saranno gratuiti
8105346 oggi la percezione della realt cambiata si spostata a voler essere un p provocatori si pu dire che viviamo unassenza della realt a favore dei campi della comunicazione e dellimmaginazione si veda il caso della crisi dei subprime e stata la comunicazione a farla da padrone le crisi economiche esistono e sono percepite perch vengono comunicate dai mezzi di informazione solo in un secondo momento subentra la realt e prendono forma i dati reali
8105347 iniziando a met degli anni 80 sono stato il primo in italia a pubblicare libri dedicati alla pubblicit e soprattutto a gettare un ponte tra questultima e il mondo della cultura oggi le cose sono cambiate perch la pubblicit solo una parte un frammento delluniverso vastissimo della comunicazione che fatta di tante cose dalladvertising a internet dagli eventi alle relazioni sempre pi interconnesse tra le persone
8105348 beh da un lato non posso tradire la mia storia nasco come editore di comunicazione e a quel campo resto legato cosa penserebbe lei se un editore come feltrinelli si mettesse da un giorno allaltro a sfornare romanzetti sentimentali sarebbe come minimo sorpreso spiazzato per non voglio farmi scavalcare dal cambiamento dalle nuove forme che la comunicazione sta assumendo
8105349 bisogna capire il senso della trasformazione e trovare gli autori che sappiano illustrarla internet stato il motore della rivoluzione perch un ambiente aperto che non si pu circoscrivere e soprattutto perch uno spazio gratuito e questo costringer tutti gli altri media a diventare gratuiti come si fa a continuare a comprare il giornale in edicola se online si trova tutto gratis
8105350 credo proprio di s basta che come del resto gi avvenuto in un sito cinese si vedano le partite e lostacolo della tv a pagamento aggirato e poi c unaltra novit che in questi anni si imposta con forza sempre maggiore
8105351 la realt creata dalla comunicazione e questo avviene in tutti i campi dalleconomia alla politica i politici non fanno le cose si limitano a dire di voler fare delle cose o come vogliono farle e questo ha gi un potere creatore sulla realt si pensi al caso del cacao meravigliao un prodotto inesistente ma che tutti credevano reale solo perch renzo arbore ne aveva parlato in tv
8105352 certamente e poi altro esempio in negativo stata la strategia di berlusconi sul caso rifiuti si evitato di comunicare i siti di smaltimento perch altrimenti la gente avrebbe protestato e ci sarebbero stati problemi quindi si scelto di risolvere il caso dei rifiuti attraverso la comunicazione o meglio in questo caso con la non comunicazione e ovviamente chi ha compreso bene questi meccanismi riesce a essere leader nel suo settore
8105353 senza dubbio si sfornano numero professionisti della comunicazione grafici art director pubblicitari uomini marketing perch il mercato li richiede ma ancora non possiamo vantare uneccellenza universitaria dove si produce un pensiero alto e filosoficamente importante
8105354 ricordo quella di telecom italia con ghandi come figura protagonista

8105357 frankly it is going wherever the customer wants to take it
8105358 i had a frantic mother come to me the other day in tears
8105359 she told me that her son timothy invited several of his friends over into his bedroom for private prayer and devotional scripture studies what she told me next is enough to send shivers down the spine of every god fearing mother and father in our christian nation satan is in our midst my friends the devil is using olympics volleyball to lure young men into shedding their clothes flopping around and falling off off their beds with him into the pit of iniquity lucifer is turning innocent afternoon gatherings of imprecatory prayer into frenzied young masturbating baptist boys clubs
8105360 heard not the sacred sounds of scripture readings accompanied by soft sweet whispers to our heavenly father but rather a noisy television set spewing chinese gibberish tuned to an olympic volleyball match
8105361 timothys head was peeking out from under the pimpled rump of his prayer leader
8105362 they were all on the bedroom floor covered in sweat their stiffened purple tallywhackers pointing in every direction
8105363 when church security officers arrived on the scene the boys had dressed themselves and were seated quietly in the living room each with an open bible on their lap
8105364 but the devil didnt clean up his mess in the bedroom no sir his tell tale hoof prints were everywhere there were empty bottles of secular lubricant four pairs of silk panties stained with the after lust of lucifers business and what appeared to be a horse harness stuffed into timothys closet along with a case of red bull in addition security officers reported the boys had been playing with superhero toys
8105365 anything related to superheroes except for jesus is forbidden in this church officer wilkins told me he found a tantus ball toy and titanmen training tools under timothys bed and were looking into it because there are bound to be some some tantus amp titanmen comic books hidden around somewhere too the sticky giant gold rings found under timothys dresser are also suspect because the boy is probably into the fantasy book series the lord of the rings and well have none of that there is also the possibility the boys were worshipping an idol because officer wilkins found a sinister looking black silicone graven image with a bulbous head and nylon straps had been thrown out of timothys window im told the tip of the idol smelled like poopy no doubt the family dog had gotten hold of it
8105366 i have no doubt in my mind that all across america christian families are coming across scenes exactly like this
8105367 we wont stand for it in this church from this day forward any member of our congregation caught watching olympic volleyball or even mentioning olympic volleyball will be asked to pack their belongings and find a place to live where your filthy sinful disgusting depraved masturbation lifestyle is accepted
8105368 so you are saying repeat back the main points is that right
8105369 yeah i guess you are right i dont have a lot of foreign policy experience but this guy does
8105370 at the end of the day it is the president not the vice president who will be making foreign policy decisions and acting as commander in chief
8105371 on every myspace page there is a stream of activities of friends on your list i caught your obama blog
8105372 i chose biden cause he looks like he has foreign policy experience
8105373 a president has a cabinet and advisors every president has had them and will have them
8105374 oh yeah but obama never said that he was picking biden for foreign policy expertise
8105375 look he doesnt even know how many houses he owns
8105376 personally i think that it is naive to think that russia just wants peace and love and that our weapons that blow airborne warheads out of the sky is a threat to their security is a legitimate argument for invading another nation on a completely different boarder is just ridiculous
8105377 threat to their security is a legitimate argument for invading another nation on a completely different boarder is just ridiculous
8105378 threat to their security is a legitimate argument for invading another nation on a completely different boarder is just rediculous
8105379 the only thing i am going to address is mccains houses
8105380 look he doesnt even know how many houses he owns
8105381 my prediction is that neither clinton nor mccain will win the nominations of their respective parties instead of giving up however they will opt to run together on an independent ticket based on the conclusion that their total is worth more to voters than the sum of their parts
8105382 what if mccain names clinton as his running mate and she accepts
8105383 i can say to you that my words that i give you are yours to feel to keep and to be loved by i hope that this blog helps create the warmth i feel within me
8105384 dont be silly youre not fat i dont know what youre talking about

8105545 the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

8105619 investment in our own intellectual properties as particularly phil harrison and i tried to do in the last five years with singstar or with the getaway or with buzz its like a patent we can take them forward
8105620 cannot have exclusives unless theyre given millions and millions of dollars not to develop a particular game for one particular platform
8105621 a great game it takes a lot of time to develop they need a little bit of funding external development in exchange its exclusive that works
8105622 we have to accept that exclusivity is not a thing of the past but it is probably with publishers we might do a few things where we feel that we need a push here or a push there

8105640 apa yang menarik mengenai haziq ialah meskipun berusia sembilan tahun tetapi corak pemikiran dan kelakuannya sungguh matang ketika mengacara dalam segmen borak
8105641 dia juga bersikap terbuka dan tidak malu beraksi di hadapan kamera serta spontan tatkala mengacara rasa berbangga juga apabila pihak produksi iklan dapat mengesan bakat haziq menerusi program di astro
8105642 peluang bergandingan bersama uncle aznil sememangnya impian haziq sejak menonton rancangan macam macam aznil haziq terus meminta mama menghantar ke sesi uji bakat program tersebut
8105643 impian haziq itu membayangi diri saya sendiri ketika kanak kanak saya begitu meminati allahyarham sudirman sehingga menanam hasrat untuk belajar di um sama seperti sudirman
8105644 akhirnya hasrat tersebut tercapai kerana saya berpendapat untuk berjaya dan terkenal seperti sudirman saya perlu mengikut langkahnya kini haziq pula ingin mencontohi saya
8105645 buat masa ini kami hanya menerima tawaran berlakon iklan berbanding drama ini kerana proses penggambaran drama memerlukan komitmen dan tempoh yang lama perangai haziq pula tepat sahaja pukul 9 malam adalah waktu tidurnya
8105646 lagipun saya dan suami tidak mahu haziq keletihan pada keesokkan hari untuk ke sekolah bagi kami pelajaran perlu diberi keutamaan terlebih dahulu
8105647 haziq memang suka bidang ini kerana dapat jumpa artis dan masuk televisyen namun begitu haziq nasihatkan kepada kawan kawan yang ingin menghadiri uji bakat
8105648 buat apa yang uncle aznil minta jangan buat uncle aznil sedih sebab dia suka kanak kanak periang dan sporting

8105650 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
8105651 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8105652 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

8105654 cos al posto del ministro con le pinne il fucile e gli occhiali a rappresentare litalia sar una giovane promessa della politica il sottosegretario vincenzo scotti omonimo del notabile democristiano risalente al periodo mesozoico della repubblica ma talmente omonimo che proprio lui
8105655 il momento internazionale cos delicato da richiedere il massimo impegno telefonico nei momenti di relax tra un bagno e laltro
8105656 con tutto il rispetto per il sottosegretario scotti con lassenza del ministro il governo italiano ha fatto una pessima figura internazionale

8105658 ada ladang gandum yang luas didepan sana berjalanlah kamu dan tanpa boleh mundur kembali kemudian ambillah satu saja ranting jika kamu menemukan ranting yang kamu anggap paling menakjubkan artinya kamu telah menemukan cinta
8105659 aku hanya boleh membawa satu saja dan saat berjalan tidak boleh mundur kembali berbalik
8105660 ada hutan yang subur didepan saja berjalanlah tanpa boleh mundur k embali menoleh dan kamu hanya boleh menebang satu pohon saja dan tebanglah jika kamu menemukan pohon yang paling tinggi karena artinya kamu telah menemukan apa itu perkawinan
8105661 sebab berdasarkan pengalamanku sebelumnya setelah menjelajah hampir setengah hutan ternyata aku kembali dengan tangan kosong jadi dikesempatan ini aku lihat pohon ini dan kurasa tidaklah buruk buruk amat jadi kuputuskan untuk menebangnya dan membawanya kesini aku tidak mau menghilangkan kesempatan untuk mendapatkannya

8105667 pope john paul i was found dead of an apparent heart attack in his vatican apartment today leaving the throne of st peter vacant for the second time in less than five weeks
8105668 the end of his 34 day reign the briefest in four centuries stunned his 700 million roman catholic followers still grieving the death of pope paul vi on august 6

8105682 we asked chip foose to design a tough muscular street rod based on the ford f 150 fx2 sport pickup that will knock the socks off even the most hard core boulevard cruiser fan
8105683 and lets make it available in less than a year before the 2007 sema show
8105684 how the vehicle sits and how the wheels are proportioned to the body is the first essence to give it the illusion of something lower than it is
8105685 chip sketches on paper he doesnt like to use computers
8105686 the ford f 150 foose edition is the fastest truck period
8105687 and its the only performance vehicle to offer the flexibility of the pickup bed
8105688 the ford f 150 lends itself to accenting because its so recognizable as americas favorite pickup its already widely accepted because it comes in the most varieties and customers spend more on it than any other truck to personalize it even further
8105689 and its clean too thats why i drive an f 150 its great looking powerful and yet very minimalist in its design
8105690 consumers want to put their personal stamps on everything they buy from personalized rings to build a teddy bear and everybody knows that you are what you drive the foose edition is a fantastic collaboration between chip foose and ford
8105691 its a vehicle that will be embraced by all kinds of buyers not just the hard core enthusiast who really knows the ford heritage and chips track record but also people who are just into cool cars and trucks couple that with chips celebrity and broad appeal there are millions of excited consumers from his tv show and i think fords got a real winner here
8105692 chip foose is similarly reaching beyond traditional automotive audiences and will help ford trucks reach an even broader audience with the 2008 ford f 150 foose edition
8105693 sarebbe una pazzia io senza dubbio vede ch un lenzolo ma pi che di la verit da solo preferisco sbajamme in compagnia dunque un fantasma senza discussione
8105694 were honored to have chip foose join us and mac tools on the race car in las vegas
8105695 i watch overhaulin its a great show im sure the car will be a big hit with race fans
8105696 last year we ran special paint schemes in gainesville and sonoma and we won both events so were hoping for the same results in las vegas
8105697 we are thrilled to be partnering with such a well known well respected and talented designer as chip foose his insight and cutting edge style will ensure that jl full throttle is on trend for die cast enthusiasts collectors and younger fans alike

8105746 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
8105747 it is currently a violation of three separate federal laws to compel medical practitioners to perform a procedure that violates their conscience
8105748 any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
8105749 protect federally funded medical practitioners from being coerced into providing treatments they find morally objectionable

8105752 guatemala no protection no justice killings of women in guatemala
8105753 collects stories of some of the horrendous crimes against women and girls that have gone unpunished mainly because of negligence and the lack of effective investigation and prevention strategies of the guatemalan authorities
8105754 the brutality of the killings reveal that extreme forms of sexual violence and discrimination remain prevalent in guatemalan society
8105755 power inequality between men and women in the social economic legal political cultural and family spheres
8105756 forced prostitution and denying a woman the right to use contraceptive methods whether natural or hormonal or taking measures to prevent sexually transmitted infections
8105757 the discussions previous to the approval of the law made it clear that the dominant macho culture in guatemala will make it difficult to implement the law
8105758 explain the law to women organizations just as they have already done to the judiciary police public health sector and army
8105759 persistent concerns about the health of u s financial firms
8105760 we consider the u s japan relationship to be fundamental to americas position in the world and we want to make that point a point based on continuity
8105761 its not democrats or republicans its americans who must realize the crucial nature of the u s japan relations
8105762 i served in japan i know how dangerous and threatening north korea under this leadership can be
8105763 i know that the abductions issue has been a profound blow to japan and her citizens and an obama administration will be very aware of that and work with japan every way we can to strengthen our joint hands in trying to restrain and modify north korean behavior
8105764 if we treat china as an enemy she will surely become one
8105765 in our talks with them underscore the value to them and to the world if they move toward more openness and greater observance of human rights
8105766 i was always amazed how other issues seemed to take over
8105767 i hope itll be in the dialogue in this campaign and one of the things that were going to try to do is make certain that the citizens of japan hear more from us about this issue at that level
8105768 no you are going to go in there and kick some ass
8105769 thats right they dont know with whom they are fucking
8105770 oh connor this is mr black hes a business associate of mine
8105771 i can assure you that i will answer any question i can truthfully mr mackenzie but i cant promise youre going to like the answers and i can appreciate how you would be angry about our deception i would be too if i were in your position but i want to be clear with you i wont tolerate any outbursts or violence today were going to have a civilized meeting where we will discuss matters peacefully and if you try to knee me in the groin again i will genetically castrate you are we clear
8105772 yes speaking as the only one in the room without the benefit of parahuman abilities id appreciate if we kept the groin kicking and whatnot to a minimum
8105773 well i have degrees from harvard yale and m i t
8105774 i thought you were some retired golden age hero or something
8105775 i reverted the cellular matrix of the damaged area to a previously saved state its sort of like using a computer back up disk but on a subatomic level unfortunately it only works with non living matter so everyones plants and goldfish died
8105776 what was the story with those crazy plants in the hallway
8105777 just some plants i picked up on my travels the royal court on shang seven uses them as guards in their palaces
8105778 i just want to make sure i understand whats going on are we in danger of having that black hole thing in there bust loose and swallow the world and shit
8105779 so just to be sure i understand the quantumworks search engine was going to use this transdimensional technology that you developed and something went wrong and now you have an unstable breach between dimensions in that big chamber back there
8105780 and youve got hydrangea and buddhist monks stabilizing the breach but its still kind of dicey
8105781 frankly mr mackenzie i dont think you could grasp my reasoning or thought processes regarding issues like this i have a more holistic perspective
8105782 well why dont you explain it to me like im a child
8105783 three years ago i purchased a controlling share of stock in the company and brought ted and aaron on board we began the quantumworks project using proprietary technology that i had developed
8105784 dont interrupt please multidimensional technology is restrictively regulated by congress its understandable after the incident in pittsburgh but that was a terrorist act perpetrated by a dangerously ignorant man the quantumworks project is for the benefit of the human species and will usher in a new age of clean efficient energy and information management
8105785 and at the risk of sounding immodest im operating beyond terrestrial law
8105786 i have tread the cosmos transcended the limitations of space and time i watched a universe being born and have seen vast empires fall i survived a lifetime of torture in a place you would call hell and brought an entire species back from extinction i was the court advisor of gods i healed a sun and assassinated a planet i studied with the creator of worlds i held alexanders hand as he succumbed to fever i have slain dragons that eat stars and have led armies in battle i have a thousand lifetimes of experience and knowledge i have read the secrets of the universe mr mackenzie now i want to share that knowledge with my own people help mankind reach their best destiny do you really think im going to let some fickle arbitrary law stop me
8105787 ted i gotta admit man youre in pretty good shape
8105788 what were you possibly hoping to accomplish mackenzie or do you even know
8105789 okay ted whats the story with that plant what is this shit are we going to die or whats the story
8105790 i cant remember what that plant does i dont think its lethal
8105791 you dont even know what it is what kind of lame ass villain are you
8105792 you really are a fucking idiot mackenzie i dont know what q sees in you
8105793 okay will somebody kindly tell me what the fuck is going on
8105794 they should take a low profile their movements should be restricted during this period
8105795 i have spent long periods of time with him in the past two years
8105796 i try to be original and innovative in all of my designs and with this race car i wanted to create a truly unique representation of speed and power
8105797 the heat waves and flames are reminiscent of the heat that radiates off of race motors and asphalt

8105809 he does that a lot the secrets of the universe speech
8105810 i have a higher purpose mr mackenzie and im willing to break a few earth laws to reach my goal i would expect you of all people to understand your relationship with the police could best be described as adversarial yet you persist in pursuit of the greater good breaking the law every night
8105811 my goal is simple i want to bring dimensional technology to the planet to humanity before its too late think of the possibilities mr mackenzie think of the problems it would solve
8105812 and of course its proprietary technology right youd license it to humanity but at a price
8105813 yes we would stand to make a lot of money
8105814 yeah i have a problem with making money when youre doing mad scientist shit and accidentally creating black holes just to make a buck call me crazy
8105815 yes given the circumstances we think its best to suspend the project until we can figure out what went wrong and how to fix it
8105816 okay then why did you bring me onboard you must have known i was the velvet marauder i dont get why youd risk having me hanging around
8105817 to be honest we were scouting you for a project we wanted to monitor you up close see how you reacted
8105818 were interested in expanding our organization by creating a network of auxiliary heroes its similar to silver strikers affiliate program but instead of a loose network of on call agents we want to form a few regional super teams to support the storm rider mission
8105819 the regional teams would handle terrestrial threats that the storm riders might not otherwise have the time to handle it would be a good opportunity for young heroes to learn tradecraft and get some experience and provides the storm riders with a large pool of potential replacements if one of us is killed or otherwise incapacitated
8105820 we place candidates under surveillance so we can get a better idea how they work weve been monitoring you for nine months now
8105821 we bugged your house with koma probes and set up micro cameras in your secret chamber and gym
8105822 we also installed gps tracking devices in your armor and set up a video feed through your goggles for point of view shots
8105823 your equipment was all designed by hephaestus our weapon smith
8105824 wombat was under consideration for the teams as well hephaestus designed his suit and spades
8105825 that was you in the interbionics building that one time
8105826 so you were planting bugs in the interbionics building that night and i came along and screwed it up
8105827 you didnt find all the bugs i got the information i needed
8105828 theyre in league with the pomeranian government and have developed some extremely dangerous technology in their lab in eastern washington
8105829 and that robot i fought the insekt model that was a pomeranian robot that interbionics was going to use to guard their lab
8105830 hey hey you were the waiter at the interbionics christmas party the one that slipped me the note warning me about the champagne
8105831 yes and i was the one that broke into your house and stole the canister of material you retrieved from interbionics it was very helpful having a sample of that material to analyze
8105832 i risked my ass to get that canister i saved the fucking day during that christmas party
8105833 yes but im still not telling you until youre part of the team i dont share intel with outsiders
8105834 you guys spy on me jerk me around for the better part of a year and now youre holding out on me
8105835 sure what about margo is she involved in all of this
8105836 ms thompson was brought on to the quantumworks project as a further incentive for you to join
8105837 we were aware of your feelings for her and thought youd be more likely to participate if she were involved
8105838 shes an excellent project manager though quite intelligent she was suspicious of the entire program from the beginning
8105839 weve had our eyes on her for a while but direct surveillance was impossible given her powers shes been tapped to join our teams
8105840 so was she working for you during the whole hungry ghost caper
8105841 we approached her shortly afterwards to ask for her help with the unstable dimensional vortex
8105842 good for her what about the bacon smell whats up with that
8105843 well an inevitable byproduct of side slipping matter teleportation is a fairly strong odor at the destination point originally it was an overpowering brimstone stench like the devil had farted
8105844 you can imagine how a noxious smell would undermine the drama of dr quark suddenly appearing out of nowhere through a great deal of trial and error i managed to change the smell to a sickly sweet perfume odor i kept working at it and now we have the relatively discrete bacon smell im working on a nag champa scent right now next question
8105845 i mean who is he really youre dr quark hes the midnight rambler he went to m i t who is ted
8105846 i dont do the cape thing anymore im a businessman now
8105847 dude and you had those shorts and the little cape
8105848 im just trying to picture you in those shorts ted
8105849 xanadu you should combine the two looks ted and wear those short shorts with some big fucking shoulder pads and that headband
8105850 the wanderer i heard siegfried and roy sued you for stealing their look
8105851 now then if youre done antagonizing mr bradbury lets talk business
8105852 are you kidding you guys offer me a fake job bug my house and my armor and shit and just generally play me like a chump and you want to talk business
8105853 fuck reasonable you made a fucking black hole dude how is making a black hole on accident any worse than making one on purpose i mean if diabolik did this you guys would be on him like stink on shit
8105854 let me tell you quietly then i quit connor mackenzie quits the velvet marauder quits i dont want to be part of your little ant farm
8105855 i quit im walking away i dont want any part of that bullshit i dont care who they are
8105856 you could have told me why didnt you tell me
8105857 and if quark told you to jump off a bridge would you do that
8105858 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8105859 i dont know what people mean by integrity i ve always found it easier to tell the truth because that way you don t have to remember what you ve said so for purely practical reasons it is the best thing
8105860 at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you c nt
8105861 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
8105862 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8105863 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
8105864 we spent the last few weeks just cranking to get this car finished in time
8105865 i literally moved into our fabrication shop so id be on site 24 hours a day to make sure that every detail of this cars build was perfect i am proud of my crew for their hard work and dedication to detail that helped make this victory a reality for me and for ken
8105866 i wanted to create a line of high end custom audio products that could integrate into any car with any color interior whether its a hot rod luxury sedan or sport compact
8105867 what weve come up with is a design thats both subtle and impressive and i think the fd series will appeal to a wide range of enthusiasts that desire both style and performance in their cars audio system

8105870 by all criteria of modern molecular biology life is present from the moment of conception
8105871 it is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception
8105872 i have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception
8105873 to accept the fact that after fertilization has taken place a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion it is plain experimental evidence
8105874 you got me begging you for mercy yeah yeah yeah
8105875 this new new ai system seems better than the last at improving itself and running our sewage system do we feel it would be ok to implement it
8105876 with the xlrs distinctive brushed stainless steel top we have recreated a design element that was popular on the beautiful cadillacs of the past like the brougham and the biarritz
8105877 weve even incorporated badging from the early 40s to distinguish and enhance the overall look
8105878 new lower rockers parking lights integrated into the redesigned front fascia baer racing brakes eibach springs and 22 inch 2005 pre production foose design wheels help complete the transformation
8105879 ive been waiting months to beat the hell out of you
8105880 most automotive professionals specialize in either design or physical fabrication but chip foose is a unique expert of both crafts
8105881 from the initial sketch to the final product the quality of design doesnt get any better than chip foose in the exhibit we wanted to show the timeline of fooses talent development and the steps in his design process to inspire the next generation of artists and fabricators
8105882 i am truly humbled by the petersen automotive museums choice to display my career work
8105883 from an early age i was fascinated by the process and the art of design i wasnt always the best artist and had to work to hone my craft i hope this exhibit will show kids that they dont have to be perfect artists right away and can express themselves artistically in a variety of ways
8105884 mccain said although he has urged an investigation into the ups dhl deal to ensure there are no antitrust violations he cant guarantee the jobs will stay
8105885 im personally calling on john mccain to send rick davis to use his considerable influence
8105886 one of the worst job catastrophes that any community in this nation is facing
8105887 every last voter in ohio should hear over and over and over day after day after day that a vote for mcsame is a vote for murder by spreadsheet it is a vote to condemn yourself and your loved ones to death by insurance
8105888 at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you c nt
8105889 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
8105890 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8105891 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
8105892 you will see technology that has never been seen before and you will be introduced to products and games that will not only be coming first to europe but global initiatives announced first in europe

8105894 connecteast takes a strong financial position into operations with cash reserves of 306 3 million at 30 june 2008 and conservative gearing
8105895 these reserves are to support connecteast through ramp up and into steady state operations
8105896 even if your outcasts are at the ends of the world from there the lord your god will gather you from there he will fetch you and the lord your god will bring you to the land that your fathers possessed and you shall possess it and he will make you more prosperous and more numerous than your fathers
8105897 basically since last night its bounced back from its low point
8105898 its just a case where weve had a nice move over the last month with the us dollar against these currencies
8105899 its not a major market mover but its a building block for gdp
8105900 the market is worried about slowing economic growth already with economists flirting with zero to negative numbers
8105901 we want to offer the product to provide the necessary protection for families who should not be forced into moving home at a time of extreme stress
8105902 like aussie amp is a major australian brand which conveys trust and integrity and we believe that together we can deliver solutions to our customers that are not only unique but will deliver great value into the future
8105903 the complexity of many life insurance products mean that customers often fail to cover themselves adequately
8105904 amps loan cover product provides a simple and flexible process that will help our customers get the cover and peace of mind that they need
8105905 suitable planting rains in june enabled the planting of 10 000 hectares ha of dryland winter crop
8105906 additionally 4 800 ha of irrigated winter crop have been planted and sufficient irrigation water is available to meet the requirement of this crop through to harvest
8105907 obviously that is having an impact on what is going on with the market hardly doing anything
8105908 we are hardly going to have any big movers out there
8105909 a fair bit of that has already been accounted into the market
8105910 the volatility we are getting at the moment one per cent is a fairly modest day

8105922 im not asking to fight supervillains and stuff i just want to know whats going on its not fair i mean i brought the whole thing to his attention in the first place im the whistle blower here
8105923 this is why you should have as little to do with what comes next as possible

8105932 have a good one what the hell is wrong with me
8105933 a persistent obstacle in the effectiveness of civil society organizations advocacy has been constraints on staffing time and resources specifically civil society organizations frequently are under pressure to balance concept and action often without sufficient capacity or capability to undertake comprehensive research and analysis
8105934 decided that for this next critical stage of the age we would have fresh editorial and executive leadership
8105935 the editorial leadership team have my highest confidence i know they will excel in leading the editorial staff of the age to ensure the ages continuing success
8105936 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8105937 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it

8105941 i thank the voters and consider this as a very defining moment in our history this is in pursuant to the clamour and demand for change that you have seen during the march 8 general election
8105942 i must thank him najib for the congratulatory remark this should be considered as a major lesson that in any election or by election all issues discussed in the campaign must be on the political agenda and issues of politics
8105943 they have to stop the malicious and scurrilous attack or racist remark in the campaign i thank him for his kind word and i would ask us both bn and pkr to move forward and discuss on the national reform agenda
8105944 all this controversy of oath will be resolved because i have now decided to take the oath
8105945 i will take the oath discuss and meet with the pakatan leaders first and then announce the next step
8105946 there is no case as far as i am concerned
8105947 ill catch some sleep and get back to kuala lumpur
8105948 any delay will be disservice to the permatang pauh voters who have acted on behalf on 27 million malaysians who have voted for democracy justice and freedom

8105953 in the modern world of business it is useless to be a creative original thinker unless you can also sell what you create
8105954 what you say in advertising is more important than how you say it
8105955 god blesses and visits me everyday now he doesnt come down and talk to me like moses through a burning bush but he uses people he blesses and visits me though people like you right now youre my angel and i am yours god is using me right now to be a blessing in someone elses life
8105956 what is truly the most genuine and popular nation in the world
8105957 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8105958 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8105959 this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8105960 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8105961 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8105962 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8105963 this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8105964 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8105965 it doesnt require surgery so hopefully it will settle down and allow him to play in the last game but well have to work around it this week
8105966 the accused threw caroline byrne off the gap because he had the motive
8105967 it was him who didnt want the relationship to end
8105968 on one occasion the accused offered him a lucrative share deal in the uk if he didnt tell anybody
8105969 let me be clear weve conducted an intensive investigation chased down numerous leads and carefully reviewed the evidence to date
8105970 it is a very serious federal crime to threaten a presidential candidate in this case however there is insufficient evidence at this time to indicate a true threat plot or conspiracy against senator obama
8105971 reported threats hateful and bigoted though they were involved a group of meth heads methamphetamine abusers all of whom were impaired at the time and they cannot independently be corroborated
8105972 the evidence involving alleged threats does not warrant federal charges but the investigation is ongoing and we are keeping an open mind
8105973 what matters at this moment from a legal point of view the law recognises a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the racist rantings of drug users
8105974 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8105975 police have surrounded government house they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate
8105976 police will seek the warrants for our arrest today dont panic if we have been arrested others will carry on
8105977 the pads highly provocative action yesterday was completely uncalled for
8105978 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8105979 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
8105980 the planes pilot has indicated that the hijackers who number 10 or maybe more have said they belong to the sudanese liberation army of abdel wahid mohammed nur
8105981 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8105982 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8105983 we dont support putting the lives of sudanese civilians at risk in any circumstances
8105984 the hijackers refuse to free any passengers or even open the doors which have remained closed since the plane landed
8105985 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
8105986 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do
8105987 hey would you mind babysitting hector on thursday for us lisas got this thing shes dragging me to
8105988 so whats the problem its just for a few hours
8105989 believe me youre not our first choice i wanted to get that hottie in lisas book club to babysit but that was a no go were desperate
8105990 i dont know mitch hectors like hes like a little baby and shit
8105991 connor hes not like a little baby he is a little baby
8105992 but im totally irresponsible the last guy you would want taking care of your child
8105993 no lisas uncle nick is the last guy i would want taking care of my child youre not even close to the top of the list
8105994 thanks connor can you be at our house by six thirty on thursday
8105995 since were past the fourth of july and the summer season has officially started what are your plans for the summer vacations trips trips that involve reading reading plans if youre going somewhere do you do any reading to prepare do you read local literature as part of your trip have you thought about using the lt local feature to help plan your book buying
8105996 there is a technical difficulty that is being worked out ill alert you when it is all clear
8105997 my mother was born before women were given the right to vote my daughter got to vote for her mother for president this is the story of america
8105998 everyone deserves to have a good portrait made of them
8105999 the pace is slowing and it will slow down from the previous quarter we have the evidence that a slowdown has happened
8106000 we expect gdp to moderate to 8 5 per cent from previous quarter
8106001 moderation has been essentially driven by a faster pace of correction in industrial growth during april june
8106002 windows media player cannot play the file because a network error occurred the server might not be available verify that you are connected to the network and that your proxy settings are correct
8106003 their relationship was adversely affected by high alcohol abuse by both parties and also extreme jealousy and possessiveness by mr walker
8106004 this blow rendered ms morrison either unconscious or at the very least stunned
8106005 i find that mr walker then went inside the house got a knife came back outside and said to ms morrison words to the effect ive got something to show you
8106006 he then stabbed ms morrison to the left side of the neck cutting her throat from left to right
8106007 it would have been terrible if she had jumped around like a chook with its head cut off
8106008 i have no criticisms to make of the actions of police in relation to this matter
8106009 last year we averaged about fifty cents per gallon savings over retail cost
8106010 so if you use a thousand gallons that saves you 500 bucks two thousand gallons it saves you a thousand bucks its quite a bit of money
8106011 we are not an organization we are simply a group of people who got together on the same database
8106012 i also got calls from neighboring towns asking for more information
8106013 it would be nice if some of the advocate groups for the state would go out and train people how to do this
8106014 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
8106015 it is impossible to imagine an australian national portrait gallery without a portrait of bradman
8106016 police are supposed to be here to protect us and make sure were safe i might be targeted for a reason that has nothing to do with the person i am
8106017 all of us share an interest in sustaining constructive relations between our campus police and the broader harvard community in order to provide a safe and welcoming environment for all faculty students staff and visitors
8106018 how long do you have to masterplan before you actually do anything
8106019 if the coalition was in power today not one single bed would have been provided in townsville not one extra bed and they stand here and criticise us
8106020 what we are about is giving aramac a future in terms of its health services
8106021 what was the admission rate over the last 12 months at aramac hospital i believe if im right they had 12 overnight admissions thats one a month
8106022 we are investing in more beds now before the new university hospital comes on line so we are meeting and recognising the growth pressures that are occurring on the sunshine coast
8106023 a blanket ban on advertising is not the silver bullet premier bligh is looking for to solve this important issue
8106024 childhood obesity is not unique to australia and governments around the world that have tried to restrict advertising to children have found that it does little to solve the problem
8106025 we strongly believe that solutions to childhood obesity are more likely to be found when government industry and other stakeholders work in concert
8106026 they place great store in the need for living independently as long as possible in having easy access to health care services and in staying in their neighbourhood of choice and being close to loved ones
8106027 these preferences are solid and widespread and send a strong message to governments about what older australians will be demanding over the next 10 to 15 years
8106028 as the worlds last great wilderness areas disappear under pressure from human impact to have a continent with this much remaining wilderness intact is unusual and globally significant
8106029 this study shines a spotlight on the best wilderness areas to protect
8106030 we aim to make a big difference in looking after our outback
8106031 so it was pleasing the way the young guys had a real dig and finished the game strongly
8106032 we knew that every game would be a challenge and leinster have clearly got some world class players but at the end of the day this tours not about going through undefeated its about setting guys up for super 14 in two or three years time so its certainly serving the purpose for us there
8106033 rodney was very good first game back at fullback in rugby for two or three years
8106034 talk about whacky and poorly thought out legislation this must take the cake in recent times
8106035 this is a hangover from the howard era its very very surprising that julia gillard and her fellow members of the labor cabinet have come up with a punitive option which sounds good but theres no evidence to say its going to work
8106036 in fact logically you could say that its going to make things worse because youre going to have the family of a truant child slung into even greater poverty and inability to get itself well ordered
8106037 i would have thought this government had more wit and wisdom than to come up with this howard hangover legislation
8106038 ill be looking to see if theres a clause in that bill that says if parliamentarians kids play hookey have their wages stopped until they get the child settled and back into school
8106039 its absurd this is neo liberal legislation and im very surprised this government and julia gillard has come up with it
8106040 the crown and the defense looked at the evidence and decided that second degree murder was the appropriate charge at least at this point in the investigation the crown did not feel that it meets the definition of first degree murder
8106041 i can tell you that the disclosure that weve received to date is quite sparse
8106042 im expecting that the police will be preparing a substantial amount of information that we have yet to see but when and if i had all that information i dont think today i would be in a position to discuss the facts that are being alleged in this case
8106043 on a murder charge the accused is remanded automatically into jail and will remain in jail unless and until the accused makes an application to be released and if the accused makes that application to be released to supreme court the crown will formulate its position at that point
8106044 they will take the information given to them from the investigators and seek evidence we need to prove what took place
8106045 we thank the public for their co operation we always receive calls in connection with a case like this which we appreciate
8106046 no se ve bien sino con el coraz n lo esencial es invisible a los ojos

8106052 the driver could not be installed due to the fact it cant find the software to install it

8106054 poor earl when they said his name everyone stood up and clapped
8106055 i think he has surpassed the goals he set for himself and hes had a fantastic experience bronze is great
8106056 we never thought hed get this far anything can happen
8106057 he has that aw shucks boy next door thing happening which is very endearing to young girls and also to old girls

8106084 bij thuiskomst nam ik de verkeerde oprit en botste met een boom die ik niet bezit
8106085 de jongen slingerde over de weg ik moest een paar keer uitwijken voor ik hem raakte
8106086 ik trok op glimlachte naar mijn schoonmoeder en vloog over de kademuur
8106087 bij mijn poging een vlieg dood te slaan reed ik een telefooncel binnen
8106088 ik reed al veertig jaar toen ik achter het stuur in slaap viel en een ongeluk kreeg
8106089 een voetganger kon geen kant meer op dus reed ik hem over
8106090 een voetganger raakte me en kwam onder mijn auto terecht
8106091 ik zei de politie dat ik niet gewond was maar toen ik mijn hoed afnam ontdekte ik dat ik een schedelbasisfractuur had
8106092 een onzichtbare auto kwam uit het niets te voorschijn raakte mijn auto en verdween
8106093 de file was er eerder dan ik dacht dus reed ik er middenin
8106094 de onzichtbare file kwam uit het niets tevoorschijn zodat ik geen kant meer uit kon
8106095 bij mijn poging de file in te halen raakte ik vast in de vangrail
8106096 een slinkse automobilist naast mij wist zo voor te dringen dat ik er wel tegenaan moest
8106097 ik remde uit alle macht maar de file was me toch nog te snel af
8106098 omdat ik al vijf kwartier in de file stond moest er wel iets gebeuren
8106099 ze lieten me er niet meer tussen hoe ik ook waarschuwde
8106100 toen ik weer voor me keek bleken alle autos plotseling stil te staan
8106101 omdat ik wel moest uitwijken voor de file raakte ik van de snelweg af
8106102 door de mist zag ik de vangrail niet eens laat staan de file
8106103 zonder uit te kijken reed iemand voor me zomaar de vluchtstrook op
8106104 toen ik uitstapte om te kijken hoe lang de file was reed iemand mijn auto total loss
8106105 om op de kaart te zien of er een vluchtroute was reed ik tegen een viaduct
8106106 ik hield me keurig aan de maximumsnelheid maar de file niet
8106107 er leek geen kip op de weg toch stond er na de flauwe bocht een gemene file
8106108 de file ging zo snel dat ik niet meer kon remmen
8106109 na de file gaf ik vol gas maar in een onbewaakt ogenblik dook hij toch weer voor me op
8106110 de achtervolgde sprong te water en dook ondanks meermaals herhaalde sommatie niet meer op
8106111 bovendien heb ik voor mijn eerste ongeluk en na mijn laatste schadevrij gereden
8106112 ik heb zo veel formulieren moeten invullen dat ik veel liever had gehad dat mijn geliefde man helemaal niet gestorven was
8106113 mijn motorfiets moest net als ikzelf vanwege ernstige schade weggesleept worden
8106114 ik heb mijn rechter arm gebroken mijn bruid heeft haar voet verstuikt ik hoop u hiermee van dienst geweest te zijn hoogachtend
8106115 ik ben in de bocht niet ver van de plaats van het ongeluk vandaan gaan slingeren tijdens het slingeren heb ik waarschijnlijk de tegemoetkomende mercedes geramd die vermoedelijk de uiteindelijke richting van de laatste fase van de rit mede heeft bepaald
8106116 ik overreed een man hij gaf zelf toe schuldig te zijn omdat hem dit al een keer eerder gebeurd was
8106117 ik ben nog nooit van een ongeval weggevlucht integendeel ik moest altijd weggedragen worden
8106118 ik ben aan het einde van mijn zenuwen en heb ook nog met een zware castritis te doen
8106119 sedert de scheiding van mijn man wordt alle noodzakelijke verkeer door mijn advocaat waargenomen
8106120 uw computer heeft mij een kind toebedeeld maar ik heb helemaal geen kind en al helemaal niet van uw computer
8106121 toen ik de kruising naderde verhief zich daar een hek om mijn vrije zicht te belemmeren
8106122 wie mijn portemonnee gestolen heeft kan ik niet zeggen aangezien er van mijn familie niemand in de buurt was
8106123 ik reed door de weide plotseling kwamen er van links en rechts meerdere voertuigen ik wist niet meer waar ik heen moest en toen knalde het van voren en van achteren
8106124 uw argumenten zijn werkelijk zwak voor zulke vuile uitvluchten moet u toch echt een dommer iemand zoeken maar die zult u bijna niet kunnen vinden
8106125 de politieauto gaf mij een stopteken bij het zoeken van een geschikte plek vond ik een brugpijler
8106126 de voetganger had er kennelijk geen idee van in welke richting hij gaan moest en dus reed ik hem aan
8106127 ik schrijf u vandaag voor de eerste en de laatste keer mocht blijken dat u niet antwoordt dan schrijf ik u meteen weer
8106128 mijn zoon heeft die vrouw niet omver gerend hij is er heel snel voorbij gerend en door de ontstane tocht is ze omgevallen
8106129 we hebben geen inkomsten uit de veehouderij met de dood van mijn man is ook het laatste rund van het erf vertrokken
8106130 mijn vrouw stond op uit bed en viel in het glas van de balkondeur eerst was ze bij soortgelijke pogingen om op te staan tegen de centrale verwarming gevallen
8106131 toen ik op de rem wilde trappen was deze er niet
8106132 mijn fiets kwam van het voetpad af raakte een porsche en reed zonder mij verder
8106133 ik heb geen levensverzekering nodig ik zou graag willen dat iedereen echt treurig is als ik eenmaal sterf
8106134 ik wil mijn kind niet laten inenten mijn vriendin heeft haar kind ook laten inenten en kort daarna viel het uit het venster
8106135 mijn auto reed eenvoudig rechtuit verder hetgeen er in een bocht in het algemeen toe lijdt dat men de straat verlaat
8106136 ik reed achteruit een steile straat naar beneden doorboorde een afscheidingsmuurtje en ramde een bungalow ik kon me gewoon niet herinneren waar het rempedaal gemonteerd was
8106137 toen stond de kerstboom plotseling in lichterlaaie de vlammen sloegen over op de gordijnen mijn man kon echter niet helpen blussen daar hij als een bezetene op zoek was naar de polis van de inboedelverzekering
8106138 onze autos knalden tegen elkaar precies op het moment dat we elkaar tegenkwamen
8106139 alle rekeningen die ik ontvang betaal ik nooit onmiddellijk daar mij daarvoor eenvoudig het geld ontbreekt de rekeningen worden integendeel in een grote trommel gestort waar ik er aan het begin van iedere maand geblinddoekt drie uit trek deze rekeningen betaal ik dan prompt ik verzoek u dan ook te wachten tot het lot u getroffen heeft
8106140 mij dochter heeft haar voet verstuikt omdat dat stomme vrouwvolk het verdomt fatsoenlijk schoeisel te dragen
8106141 meteen na de dood van mijn man ben ik weduwe geworden
8106142 de tennisbal kwam elegant en zuiver aan geslagen door mijn dochter helaas heb ik er mijn hoofd in plaats van het racket voor gehouden
8106143 volgens de taxatie van de expert zal de schade tussen de 250 000 en een kwart miljoen bedragen
8106144 tijdens het dansen van de bekende holladihia hoppsassa sprong ik overmoedig omhoog waarbij ik mijn danspartner stevig ondersteunde daarbij kwam het kelderplafond sneller op mij af dan ik verwachte
8106145 in uw schrijven van 26 6 over de nieuwe eigen bijdrage heeft u mij allervriendelijkst tot mejuffrouw bevorderd wat echter in samenhang met mijn voornaam henk helaas aanleiding tot pijnlijke vermoedens kan geven
8106146 ik reed eerst met mijn auto tegen de vangrail sloeg toen over de kop en knalde tenslotte tegen een boom toen verloor ik de macht over het stuur
8106147 bij de kruising aangekomen had ik een onverwachte aanval van kleurenblindheid
8106148 met de wettelijk ter plekke maximaal toegestane snelheid botste ik op een vrouw die mij tegen alle geldende voorschriften in tegemoet kwam
8106149 de andere wagen was absoluut onzichtbaar en toen verdween hij ik vond er een grote kuil en bleef er zelf in
8106150 de andere auto kwam met de mijne in botsing zonder mij zijn bedoeling kenbaar te maken
8106151 in hoog tempo naderde de telegraafpaal mij ik begon te zigzaggen maar ondanks dat raakte de telegraafpaal mij tegen de radiator
8106152 nog voor ik hem aanreed was ik er al van overtuigd dat deze oude man nooit de overkant van de straat zou bereiken
8106153 ik had de hele dag planten ingekocht toen ik de kruising naderde groeide er plotseling een flinke struik in mijn gezichtsveld en ik kon het andere voertuig totaal niet meer zien
8106154 de paal raasde op mij af en net toen ik uit wilde wijken botste ik er frontaal op
8106155 toen mijn auto van de weg raakte werd ik er uit geslingerd en kwam ik in het weiland terecht een paar koeien vonden mij later in mijn gat
8106156 ik zag een treurig gezicht langzaam voorbij zweven toen sloeg de man met een harde klap op het dak van mijn auto
8106157 terwijl ik normaal door de straat reed bekroop mij het verlangen mij te ontlasten zodoende stopte ik aan de rand van de weg en begaf mij in de bosjes net toen ik mijn broek had laten zakken kwam de tegenpartij en gaf mij met zijn kieper een forse dreun van achteren
8106158 de getuigen van de aanrijding zijn tegen de achterkant aangeniet
8106159 het paard liep over de rijbaan zonder zich er volgens de voorschriften van te vergewissen of deze vrij was
8106160 de andere wagen reed dan eens links dan weer rechts dan weer naar links voordat ik met hem in botsing kon komen
8106161 kort en goed als ik het geld niet binnen acht dagen ontvang zie ik er geheel vanaf
8106162 om de botsing te vermijden stuurde ik tegen de andere wagen
8106163 mijn bruid heeft de agenten die het ongeval kwamen opnemen alles laten zien wat ze maar wilden zien
8106164 uw schrijven inzake toestemming voor een darmbad kuur is bij mij in de entree terechtgekomen
8106165 ik dacht dat het raam openstond het was echter gesloten hetgeen ik pas bemerkte toen ik mijn hoofd naar buiten stak
8106166 het glas is kapot ik stuur hierbij een splinter van de ruit waaraan u kunt zien dat ze stuk is want anders zou ze onbeschadigd zijn
8106167 ik ben zwaar ziek geweest en tot tweemaal toe bijna gestorven dan kunt u toch op zijn minst alvast de helft van de overlijdenspremie uitkeren
8106168 aangezien ik niet meer met mijn man samenleef verzoek ik u een competente vertegenwoordiger langs te sturen
8106169 laat u het mij alstublieft weten indien u dit schrijven niet ontvangen hebt
8106170 mij treft aan het ongeval in het geheel geen schuld de oorzaak was die jonge vrouw in minirok als u een man bent is een verdere verklaring overbodig als u een vrouw bent begrijpt u het sowieso niet
8106171 het had ondertussen op verschillende plaatsen gesneeuwd de rijweg was daardoor in diverse straten plaatselijk glad geworden ik wilde de auto afremmen ik probeerde van alles maar niets hielp toen knalde ik tegen de omheining en hiervan was ik meteen bewusteloos het was helemaal uit met de pret
8106172 ik trof hem vol op de ster d w z op de punt van de motorkap vervolgens veegde ik hem zijwaarts over de voorruit weg
8106173 ik ben van beroep slijter uw computer heeft echter per abuis in plaats van een l een ch op het formulier geprint
8106174 het jachtplezier is voor mijn vader noodlottig gebleken men zag hem voor een gewoon zwijn aan en schoot hem neer
8106175 will act powerfully to defeat the purposes of the whistleblower protection act
8106176 if we find that there was retaliation we do something about it
8106177 this decision shouldnt deter people from filing whistle blower complaints because they will be investigated by the university
8106178 it just seems like such an inherent conflict of interest
8106179 what possible rationale is there for exempting the university of california from whistle blower

8106246 i was in front of the front row last night
8106247 last night before i went to the floor i saw that theres a press room its lovely its air conditioned
8106248 then theres a little room off to the side and its dark and its dank were clearly not allowed to mingle with the big kids im hoping in 2008 or 2012 well get past that
8106249 other than that its amazing we have our own space
8106250 physical presence counts for a lot in 2004 there were bloggers but we didnt have a space what it says is we are here we are present in a way we havent been before
8106251 its an interesting time to meet my fellow bloggers and learn a lot more about how the sausage gets made
8106252 its fun to be part of a community thats merging into its own in the progressive community
8106253 you guys are a couple years ahead of us as far as the use of internet in politics

8106257 the access to the convention center is the most important thing if you want to be able to say you attended
8106258 but to be honest the big tent is much better
8106259 theres an obama mania in greece and europe in general
8106260 the media loves him and bloggers love him too since hes used the internet in his campaign i hope he keeps them mesmerized after the election if he gets elected when it really becomes difficult
8106261 i live in a place in alabama where i cant get cell phone access from my house and i cant use wireless internet because we dont have broadband out in the country
8106262 edwards spoke to those issues when edwards pulled out i just kind of checked out and waited to see

8106280 this is a great tool but i really dont want to share with anyone can i keep it private
8106281 he did not take the time to understand the area in which he was working its entire history not just the skeletal stuff
8106282 any time you work anywhere you have to understand this history you just cant walk in and cowboy it pull some stuff out and draw conclusions in the absence of understanding the bigger picture
8106283 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8106284 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8106285 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working using fragmentary remains again in a situation where he didnt understand variation and stepping outside his own area of expertise which i think all scientists try not to do but sometimes we do
8106286 although we have not seen the material that berger et al base their results on we can speak to the diversity and normalcy of human skeletal series from throughout the archipelago that have been excavated from several burial caves over the last decade as well as the an abundance of archaeological linguistic and historical data indicating a general continuity of cultural traits over a period of three millennia
8106287 archaeological data also do not suggest a separate isolated group evolving differently biologically or culturally although there are subtle differences and changes that occur through time
8106288 had bergers team compared their scant dental metric data with those of other regions in the pacific or elsewhere in the world they would have seen that large teeth are not uncommon in early peoples of these regions

8106298 the musician does not know that he wills what is not allowed and does not will that which is of necessity and he does not know either what is his own or what is or what is another mans but if he did know he could never be impeded he would never be hindered he would not be anxious
8106299 since this is indifferent to my virtue and vice it isnt important

8106318 that doesnt seem right at all i thought that when you became a christian jesus would set you free from the s
8106319 but if christ is in you your body is dead because of sin yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness
8106320 if the devil and god both move us by the same channels what is the difference
8106321 i have a rash on my arm oh yes i do have cancer but dont bother with that just treat the rash and ill be on my way
8106322 oh dont talk to me about intellectual things or practical matters im a free spirit i want to experience life i want to feel
8106323 i have no patience with intellectualism or emotionalism i believe in being practical i believe in action
8106324 look even you as pagans are intelligent enough to know that god does not dwell in temples made of stone how could the creator of the universe be contained by such a paltry man made dwelling place even your own greek poets recognize the fact that god is not far from anyone of us for in him we live and move and have our being you already know that much about god now im going to give you the complete biblical revelation so that you will know exactly who god is
8106325 im too sophisticated for old fashioned bible thumping organized religion
8106326 i believe in god but i prefer to imagine my own god i would rather worship god in a meadow or by a running stream than in a church
8106327 i dont need to read the bible or go to church to understand god the bible can mean anything you want it to and churches are just full of hypocrites
8106328 yes i am real i am the devil remember i am a powerful cunning adversary so youd better focus all your thought and energy on defeating me
8106329 i believe in god i believe in jesus christ but i do not believe in the existence of a personal devil
8106330 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god
8106331 there is no fear in love but perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment the one who fears is not made perfect in love
8106332 for god did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power of love and of self discipline
8106333 god i cant trust you to do what is right in my life i dont know if you really know best if you really care about me if youre really taking care of me
8106334 this is the way ive always done it why change
8106335 this is an example of why i dont want to use technology in the classroom i dont allow students to use laptops in class while im teaching they are simply a distraction
8106336 i just feel like were finding different ways to win ballgames
8106337 were kind of spoiled by now its been like that since april
8106338 i just want to get as deep in the game as i can
8106339 give the team a chance to win and put up as many zeros as i can
8106340 the way he takes the mound sets the tone for the game
8106341 playing defense behind him when hes pounding the strike zone like that it keeps you on your toes
8106342 i felt good for the first two innings and then i just got away from my game plan
8106343 i tried to battle through it but it just didnt work out a bounce here and a bounce there and that was it
8106344 we just didnt make plays that we should have we just couldnt stop the bleeding
8106345 just hopefully well continue to win the way we are as a team and finish strong
8106346 leaf followers are hoping that russian forward nikolai kulemin will be that player but kulemin has never competed in north america and may fall into the all encompassing category of toronto prospects that have been vastly over hyped through the years if he is akin to 95 of leaf hopefuls since the mid 70s kulemin will fall short of expectation
8106347 by finishing 12th and garnering the no 7 draft position in june the leafs had to trade up a couple of spots to select kelowna defenseman luke schenn projected by many scouts to be a stalwart presence behind centre ice
8106348 and though its foolhardy to compare prospects to nhl legends remember the effect scott stevens had on enemy attackers during the new jersey devils championship years 1995 to 2003
8106349 of course that will come about only after another season of failure in the nhl but how tough can it honestly be for the leafs legion of followers to suffer through one more year after four plus decades of futility
8106350 given that the leafs are halfway to the current nhl model with schenn its a rather puny investment in time and angst and its the prime reason gm cliff fletcher has obliterated the core of his roster choosing to avoid anything that resembles a quick fix for 2008 09 fletcher sees what is happening around the league
8106351 oh and have you heard the latest heap being shoveled by the gossip mongering character eklund
8106352 hey its summer itll make you watch water polo on tv and make you believe eklund you can probably do better things with your time
8106353 twitter cute what do i need that time sucker for
8106354 im charles gibson and i hope you had a good day from all of us at abc news have a good night
8106355 my wastewater treatment system is smarter than your honor student
8106356 one person on board the aircraft died and three were wounded during the incident
8106357 to pay continuous partial attention is to pay partial attention continuously it is motivated by a desire to be a live node on the network another way of saying this is that we want to connect and be connected we want to effectively scan for opportunity and optimize for the best opportunities activities and contacts in any given moment to be busy to be connected is to be alive to be recognized and to matter we pay continuous partial attention in an effort not to miss anything it is an always on anywhere anytime any place behavior that involves an artificial sense of constant crisis we are always in high alert when we pay continuous partial attention
8106358 we have focused on managing our time our opportunity is to focus on how we manage our attention we are evolving beyond an always on lifestyle as we make choices to turn the technology off to give full attention to others in interactions to block out interruption free time and to use the full range of communication tools more appropriately we will re orient our trek toward a path of more engaged attention more fulfulling relationships and opportunities for the type of reflection that fuels innovation
8106359 we will soon be holding in our hands the boxes of the game the adventure is about to begin
8106360 weve done our best to create the next great mmorp experience but its the fans that will bring our world to life
8106361 the day of reckoning approaches and its going to be glorious its time to go to war
8106362 as a life long resident of the shire i have been honoured to have served my community in this capacity over the best part of the past five years
8106363 over the past few weeks i have begun to inform local liberal party members that i will not contesting the election
8106364 the shire is the best community to live in and i have enjoyed the opportunity to put something back into the place where i live and will continue to live over my lifetime
8106365 his words to us were there would be no money for any person who opposed the sale
8106366 i have 100 delegates who will vouch for me mate this is too good to make up
8106367 there is a need more pressing by the day to question the value of the economic political and personal liberty that has been won
8106368 i felt strongly it would only be a burden to the world
8106369 the population of the world must be very quickly reduced
8106370 every time someone dies as a result of floods in bangladesh an airline executive should be dragged out of his office and drowned
8106371 humans would have no choice but to establish an earth commission for thermostatic control
8106372 inevitably one day some commissioner will suggest that their work would be more effectively done were they to concentrate on the root cause of the issue the total number of people on the planet
8106373 and with such a move the earth commission for thermostatic control will have transformed itself into an orwellian style world government with its own currency army and control over every person and every inch of our planet
8106374 as horrific as such an outcome is if we delay action to combat the climate crisis the carbon dictatorship may become essential for our survival
8106375 this is the kind of mother i strive to be
8106376 well ill have to get back to you about whether thats adequate
8106377 lets call your mom and tell her she should come get you because youre not being safe when you cross the street
8106378 you know we dont usually leave kids alone out here until theyre quite a bit older some of us find babysitters through the local college nanniesrus etc would you like the number
8106379 holy cow those kids do not sound safe in that guys care
8106380 can you please do a cut and paste so there is no email trail back to me
8106381 i thought i would take this opportunity to publicly thank councillor martin tolar
8106382 while a number of other councillors talk about holding office to help our community i can honestly say i have found that only councillor tolar was prepared to do more than pay lip service to this notion
8106383 look at this picture i painted in art class mommy
8106384 but this is a representational image of the revivalist movement and yesterday was just a bowl of fruit
8106385 travis im not gonna have these endless conversations with you

8106388 the rights of the individual to go about his or her business peaceably so long as they dont infringe on the rights of others
8106389 god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply
8106390 the right to be different to dress funny to create ugly or incomprehensible art and be praised for it to be a child at age 30
8106391 the america you and i would like to live in america of small government individual privacy the reward of enterprise and achievement freedom of speech and worship is not primarily sustained by abstract libertarian principles but by a living nation and people whose way of life sustains such liberties
8106392 our research tells us the governments plans would have significant and unintended consequences for business we dont believe the government intended to design a scheme to achieve the outcome of businesses and jobs moving offshore but that would be the outcome of the governments plans
8106393 we want to ensure that industry plays its part but that the cost is kept at a level which allows them to stay in australia rather than move to a less demanding jurisdiction
8106394 this would also transform our economy from one dependent on sunset extractive industries into a secure diverse growing economy that can thrive in a carbon constrained world
8106395 if we can still stop this it will only be by a superhuman effort to ditch fossil fuels within ten years as al gore has proposed
8106396 if the king loves music it is well with the land
8106397 music gives a soul to the universe wings to the mind flight to the imagination and life to everything
8106398 it will be a huge project to collect the evidence that can prove microsoft is monopolising the mainlands pc software market so it would be best to leave that job to the government
8106399 microsoft is not aware of an investigation by the ministry of commerce or other anti monopoly law agencies at this time
8106400 from a legal point of view it should not be a problem to prove that microsoft has operated as a monopoly
8106401 beijing may file a lawsuit if microsoft has really stifled the scientific innovation potential of smaller chinese software firms
8106402 und falls ihr nicht wisst wie ihr uns verabschieden k nnt macht ne welle

8106405 in deutschland geht ein beat um vom schicksten villenviertel bis in die sozialbausiedlung
8106406 we will be publishing the results of this survey extensively in distributed brochures the media and in advertisements run in local newspapers
8106407 of course the idea behind this information pack is an attempt to bribe candidates into supporting their proposal by asking candidates to fill in and return the accompanying survey in exchange for free advertising during the council elections
8106408 it merely a cynical and disingenuous attempt by kirrawee centre pty ltd to play politics in the shire
8106409 it gives us an idea of what the councillors and candidates attitudes are
8106410 the councillors put this on the election agenda so voters have every right to know their thoughts on the matter
8106411 we cannot say that carbon is driving climate change it certainly never has in the past
8106412 co2 is a minor greenhouse gas whereas water vapour accounts for 95 of greenhouse gases which means our oceans are the biggest greenhouse gas emitters
8106413 zonal mean atmospheric temperature change from 1890 to 1999 c per century
8106414 i swear by my life and my love of it that i will never live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine
8106415 the mind is an attribute of the individual there is no such thing as a collective brain there is no such thing as a collective thought
8106416 any acceptance of faith or feeling as a means of knowledge
8106417 no law can be sacred to me but that of my nature
8106418 good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this the only right is what is after my constitution the only wrong is what is against it
8106419 when good is near you when you have life in yourself it is not by any known or accustomed way you shall not discern the footprints of any other you shall not see the face of man you shall not hear any name the way the thought the good shall be wholly strange and new
8106420 our position is not entirely different from that of leftists in the early 20th century when they were shunned and persecuted and had to encourage themselves by supporting each other and dreaming of a better future
8106421 if the king loves music it is well with the land
8106422 music gives a soul to the universe wings to the mind flight to the imagination and life to everything
8106423 our six year old son sam would fall asleep listening to it and then be singing in the sweet by and by at breakfast the next morning
8106424 there were more songs that my wife and i wanted him and gracie and charlie to know now theyre singing along to these new takes on i stand amazed and victory in jesus at the top of their lungs and were so happy about how that affirms the decision to do this again
8106425 ive learned the lyrics of that era were more horizontal than vertical
8106426 a lot of songs from the 1700s were direct praises to jesus and thats reflected on the first hymned record but in the 1800s the message was often person to person an ive got to get my brother or sister saved way of expressing faith
8106427 if the song was upbeat wed get out a funky harry connick jr album some louis prima big band or a bob wills swing record for inspiration and swing for the fence hoping to get that soundtrack to your life vibe and if it was a slow song wed go the other way and really make it worshipful
8106428 hes the nicest guy on the planet but it still makes me nervous to call him up
8106429 i asked his wife amy grant who i know better if shed ask him to sing with me again
8106430 i grew up in the church and hymns influence the way i write lyrics but this is the music that made a lasting impression on me outside the church
8106431 to do a record like this with mercyme to break out the banjoes and horns and dobroes would be a bust thats not what we do but this gives me another creative outlet that in turn helps me have more to offer going back into whatever we do next
8106432 if the king loves music it is well with the land
8106433 music gives a soul to the universe wings to the mind flight to the imagination and life to everything
8106434 it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all

8106729 no se si recuerden que unos dias antes del 2 de julio se publico una carta en el sitio del prd que llamaba a la resistencia civil
8106730 es una estrategia que se tenia planeada cuando las encuestas se apretaron
8106731 hay que analizar el fallo del tribunal y ver que si bien hubo la famosa intervencion de fox esto fue compensado por la intervencion de mas de un gobernador incluido

8106738 we are happy that this painting of our bensenville illinois facility has been accepted by the man at work the eckhart g grohmann collection it is an honor that this donation can join the other depictions of work at this fine institution
8106739 we appreciate that cmc has shown the public spiritedness to bring this fine painting to our collection for our community to enjoy for years to come
8106740 passengers are reminded to stand away from the yellow line an average man weighs x amount of stone and the train weighs x amount of tons now imagine what will happen to your toes if the train has to go over them if the yellow line is not clear then i need to slow the train down to about 30 mph and that can delay the journey and if the line is not clear at all then i cannot pull into the station and that will cause delays on the entire london transport system please stand clear of the doors doors are closing i will not be able to close the doors if passengers are standing against them
8106741 len vandenboom is a legend at msoe it was his vision 32 years ago that enabled us to have a highly competitive 20 sport ncaa program that we have today
8106742 he has been a beloved figure as baseball coach for many years his players will miss his caring attitude and guidance in their development as productive members of society
8106743 este es un movimiento voluntario los que quieran participar bienvenidos nadie esta en contra de su volunta pero los que participen deber n apoyar todas y cada una de las decisiones si no estan de acuerdo con alguna de ellas mejor que se vayan no queremos que nadie esta a la fuerza este es un movimiento para restaurar la republica

8106749 veruit het meest geslaagd was omdat lanoye zoals gezegd een concrete stimulus nodig heeft om zijn mimetisch talent de vrije loop te kunnen laten
8106750 wie samenzweert met de werkelijkheid krijgt inderdaad soms toegang tot haar magische krachten
8106751 stand up comedy is een problematisch genre te vaak verzandt het in vrijblijvende neger homo en andere aangebrande moppen waarbij de botheid het gebrek aan talent moet verbergen dan wordt het al snel nieuw politiek correct zo grof mogelijk de vroegere politieke correctheid schenden vertel een grove racistische mop met een knipoog naar de antiracisten die mogen lachen omdat het te grof is om gemeend te zijn en de echte racisten kunnen lachen op een eerstelijnsniveau dat is geen comedy maar slecht middenstandsgewin
8106752 haar regie van het stuk van lanoye getuigt van alles wat een goede regisseur moet bezitten
8106753 het verhaal van een banale jeugdliefde en haar vertederende kracht
8106754 wat zeer irriterend is voor een recensent want hij kan aan zijn lezers niets verklaren of zijn spitsvondigheid in het ontrafelen van literaire puzzels etaleren
8106755 een teken van verloedering zoals een recruut die zichzelf plots bevordert tot generaal
8106756 de klassieke literaire jeugdliefde gaat om twee vrienden die beiden verliefd zijn op hetzelfde meisje de ene haalt het de andere verliest meisje en vriend meestal is dat de gast die begint te schrijven bij mij valt die vriend en die jeugdliefde samen de sleutel van het boek is dat ik uit liefde een vriend verlies
8106757 denk je nu echt dat dit de homo emancipatie vooruithelpt
8106758 laat me duidelijk stellen dat het geen huwelijk is wel een symbolische actie om de wetgever op zijn verantwoordelijkheid te wijzen er is nog een grote discriminatie tussen samenwonenden en gehuwden schepen s rensen zal trouwens eerst een heterokoppel ingrid van der veken en een collega journalist registreren als officieel samenwonend er zijn meer heteros dan homos kandidaat
8106759 ik hou ook wel van sm spelletjes ze kunnen seksueel zeer prikkelend werken
8106760 zelf ben ik een zeer groot bewonderaar van willy courteaux zijn vertaling is de meest accurate en bruikbare die men zich maar kan voorstellen maar op een podium niet wendbaar genoeg wij hebben een bewerking gemaakt g n vertaling
8106761 ik heb op zn minst alles in vijfvoetige jamben geschreven wat zijn goedkeuring zou moeten wegdragen
8106762 als helderheid je belangrijkste zorg is of was dan valt niet te begrijpen waarom je aan de ene historische kant tientallen verwijzingen schrapt en er tegelijkertijd aan de andere kant minstens zoveel toevoegt wat heb je aan dit soort pastiches en verwijzingen als je geen voorkennis hebt van soaps popmuziek tarantino films en andere iconen uit de hedendaagse populaire cultuur de vraag is niet of zoiets kan natuurlijk kan het de vraag is voor wie je dit soort theater dan maakt voor een publiek dat met dit referentiekader vertrouwd is voor anderen zijn deze verwijzingen net zo onduidelijk en misschien zelfs veel onduidelijker dan de historische en intertekstuele verwijzingen die in deze productie werden geschrapt wat win je door te verhiphoppen wat voeg je toe door de koningsdramas uit hun historische bedding te tillen elke sociaal economische context te schrappen en het welluidende engels dat er stond te vervangen door kan het postmoderne fin de si cle in west europa nu werkelijk niets creatievers dwingenders bedenken voor zijn klassieken dan ze door de tarantino mangel te halen kunnen wij het tragische alleen nog ironiseren het gruwelijke banaliseren als kunst emoties niet langer verhevigt maar verdunt waarvoor heb ik die kunst dan nog nodig ik heb af en toe briljante koningssketches gezien maar eigenlijk wilde ik een overrompelende beklijvende theatervoorstelling
8106763 wat in de meeste kritieken zichtbaar wordt is een discrepantie tussen observatie en oordeel de observatie is genuanceerder dan het uiteindelijke oordeel die discrepantie verraadt de immense sociale druk die dit megagebeuren op mensen uitoefent men z l dit loven al weet men niet precies waarom
8106764 een ophefmakende theatergebeurtenis omdat in de receptie van dit stuk de esthetische maatstaven van de generatie duidelijker dan ooit tevoren worden uitgedrukt als cultuursociologisch verschijnsel zijn en de kritische ontvangst van het stuk of liever het ontbreken van een kritische ontvangst een belangrijk evenement het is een van de generatie waar ik willens nillens toe behoor maar het hip hop hoerageroep bezorgt mij grote twijfel
8106765 hoe ijverig lanoye zich ook uitslooft voor de eigen of voor de goede zaak hij is altijd actief
8106766 nu voor mijn part ontploft de staat belgi maar ontploft vlaanderen ook belgi is natuurlijk historisch gezien een nogal rare constructie heel onnatuurlijk maar dat is het vlaanderen dat wij nu kennen ook als je dat gezeik dat belgi geen historisch ontstaan heeft op vlaanderen ook toepast dan schiet er geen reet meer van over als je het hele discours van de walen profiteren van ons want er gaat geld van ons naar hen en we spreken niet dezelfde taal en er zijn mentaliteitsverschillen nu eens toepast op vlaanderen leg die drie punten tussen limburgers en zuid west vlamingen dan klopt dat ook
8106767 met walschap heeft lanoye gemeen dat hij een ambivalente volksverbondenheid heeft een haat liefdeverhouding met het eigen vlaanderen dat hem in staat stelt haarscherp en uitermate herkenbaar de couleur locale van la flandre profonde weer te geven en er tegelijk de universele dimensies van op te roepen
8106768 tussen uw dichtwerk en dat van tom lanoye bespeuren wij alvast weinig continu teit
8106769 dat bewijst dan maar dat we ruimdenkender waren dan sommigen ons willen voorstellen die mensen zijn toch een beetje onder mijn toezicht begonnen en ik heb hen toch gevolgd en ik moet zeggen ze hebben nooit kwaad over mij verteld

8106781 through the new program local bands and musicians will have the opportunity to reach wider audiences in milwaukee and worldwide through our live webcast
8106782 the concept is an excellent fit with the universitys institutional philosophy as well as the type of students who study here
8106783 engineering for example adapts human and natural resources to solve the problems of society and improve the human condition
8106784 the current curriculum challenges students to explore the impact their actions or inactions have on humanity the environment and our global community our students faculty and staff already embrace the philosophy this chair will formalize and broaden it
8106785 msoe is focused on outcomes and measured effectiveness and is not afraid of accountability
8106786 robert greenleafs best test of servant leadership is do those served grow as persons do they while being served become healthier wiser freer more autonomous more likely themselves to become servants servant leadership could become the universitys gold standard approach for both students and employers the attitude is what does the world need from our students and how may we best prepare them to serve others
8106787 paying attention to the teachings of the old testament and the example of jesus
8106788 i then came back to it when we were researching our employee ownership model and a friend gave me a membership to the greenleaf center
8106789 i expect the impact of this gift to both grow and deepen with each passing year
8106790 first there will be signs of people responding interest in the idea of servant leadership at msoe will grow and it will continue to evolve the low hanging fruit picked first by those who are most interested in servant leadership will be the easiest to harvest other seeds will grow more slowly with servant leadership having its impact in unpredictable ways years into the future there is already great enthusiasm by msoe faculty and there has been excellent student input this nucleus of servant leaders at msoe will increasingly influence others the best leadership is grounded in meaningful service to others
8106791 we bought a house and moved here last year and havent regretted it for a moment
8106792 the students here are so wonderful and bright but they dont even realize how gifted they are
8106793 i made a commitment that no matter what else i did i would always teach
8106794 we dont want to view it as just an academic theory we want it to change lives
8106795 i am really happy for these three guys as this was a major goal that they were working towards all year
8106796 have a military background and are like a commanders orders to his soldiers
8106797 in the lord and in the strength of his might
8106798 i have nothing to offer but blood toil tears and sweat
8106799 if possible as far as it depends upon us to be at peace with all people
8106800 by pursuing his vocation as a leader in the field of higher education dr viets has provided his fellow milwaukeeans with a stellar educational institution in which all of us can take deep pride
8106801 to be powerful one must forsake grace to be graceful one must forsake power
8106802 religion is for those who want to avoid hell spirituality is for those who are in hell and want to get out
8106803 compassion without action is sentimentality compassion is a verb not a noun
8106804 i have one life and one chance to make it count for something and the something i have chosen is my faith now my faith goes beyond theology and religion and requires considerable work and effort my faith demands and this is not optional my faith demands that i do whatever i can wherever i can whenever i can for as long as i can to try to make a difference
8106805 if the king loves music it is well with the land
8106806 music gives a soul to the universe wings to the mind flight to the imagination and life to everything
8106807 oh well well just have to watch it again then
8106808 well the froglet was sitting quietly on my knee then he looked at me and vomited in my face
8106809 matt had another excellent performance which allowed him to qualify his third national tournament appearance
8106810 he continues to prove he is one of the elite wrestlers in the nation at his weight class i expect him to further prove this on the national stage as he is very focused on doing well
8106811 we try to get him to speed the match up
8106812 by keeping the other guy continuously moving matt wears him down and often takes the advantage however matt has only been able to use this strategy by getting himself in top physical condition if hes not properly conditioned the strategy doesnt work as matts record indicates he has put in the work necessary to be successful
8106813 our on campus displays were well received by students and visitors so i approached the historical society about reaching out to a wider audience
8106814 i think people who see the displays will be impressed with how the city of milwaukee was on the cutting edge in industrial technology and leading the nation in education 100 years ago
8106815 after several loud noises and crackles followed by deafening silence it looked like we were eliminated from the competition
8106816 but in the never say die spirit that weve come to expect from our aero teams the team immediately began organizing a plan to rebuild without even knowing the full extent of the damage they literally picked up the pieces and decided to rebuild it with 18 hours remaining in the contest
8106817 it was absolutely incredible to see what they accomplished throughout the night
8106818 the fact that we flew again and ended up surprising everyone to win the competition is a bonus the teamwork dedication and desire that these students demonstrated is much more impressive than the actual victory
8106819 im very proud of the teams effort to get this championship
8106820 performance testing of a gradient tetralatticetm heat fin built via solid freeform fabrication
8106821 the benefits of green roof systems on the milwaukee watershed
8106822 words can not explain how happy i was for matt when he defeated lycoming colleges tom snyder to guarantee an all american season
8106823 he has come so close in the past i am ecstatic that it worked out for him
8106824 greta werwath murphy was a very key individual in the development of msoe
8106825 she was a wonderful lady who served the university in many ways including vice president as the daughter of oscar werwath she was a personal historical link to our founding 100 years ago
8106826 i always wanted to study engineering but never had the time
8106827 the judges commented that msoe set a new standard in their presentation
8106828 the project is progressing well and we are excited about the environment we will be able to offer our students once the construction is completed
8106829 our new hot zones are another strong sign that milwaukee is ahead of the pack in becoming a connected city
8106830 its really a great fit since downtown is wisconsins top technology center and its most popular gathering place i expect to see a lot of people logging on to this system
8106831 i had been telling my guys all week that we would have to have everybody complete their roles if we were going to win the tournament said coach kevin morin who was named coach of the year for the fourth time
8106832 and that is exactly what they did things were not looking good heading into the final round and then the guys really stepped it up
8106833 owen and ryan both showed a tremendous amount of heart out there
8106834 owen was coming off a knee injury that has sidelined him since christmas ryan beat a very tough opponent in the finals that had previously beaten him two times this year ryan was on a mission
8106835 greg has really stepped it up this year and the results show it
8106836 select mark and cast an election ballot in 20 or more steps
8106837 im pleased with the effort we put out through the season
8106838 we had some ups and downs but looking back we had some great highlights im optimistic about the future of this team as all 22 players will be returning next year
8106839 the faculty have worked hard to build the program and to prepare for the abet visit and the software engineering students have helped to shape and improve the program
8106840 our industry partners have been very supportive and eager to benefit from what our graduates have to offer the accreditation of this program is a sign of the maturity of software engineering as an accepted engineering discipline we hope our graduates will play a major role in improving the software systems on which industry and society depend
8106841 adkins brings to msoe his strong commitment to free enterprise a successful business career and an earnest desire to share his knowledge and experience
8106842 dit il oups l ya un souci je rejoins le spot avec lucile pour essayer de shooter mais ils ne sont plus que cinq ou six warriors dans lar ne boueuse la neige est plus molle que pr vue

8106845 both of these tend to be faultfinders malicious satirists grumblers carping critics full of bitter scorn know it alls who think they have the monopoly of infallible judgment they are self legitimizing prophets in short fanatics
8106846 guardians of the temple threshold transported into frenzy by the divinity
8106847 they are ill humored as was jansenism in toto which spread like a blight for centuries over the spiritual life of
8106848 they are rigid while the catholic is pliable flexible yielding
8106849 clamor for the tangible exercise of papal authority and elevate to the status of dogma things that are not such as communion on the tongue and all kinds of apparitions of the mother of god etc
8106850 not all in the catholic church possess the balance that we have indicated by the reference to humor
8106851 only the catholic form guarantees the miraculous quality of being the freedom the sense of being a child of adventure the resilient energizing paradox of existence
8106852 were you in it for just me or were you in it for that soldier for that
8106853 go to law for a sheep and lose a cow
8106854 outstanding contributions to the enhancement and visibility of the wisconsin entertainment industry and for having make a unique commitment to musicians and the music community on a local national and or international level longtime radio personality bob reitman also won a president award
8106855 if they are on their game we could come home with some hardware
8106856 if they lay an egg we will come home with bruises
8106857 both helps complete the extensive retrofit of this facility for students and gives them hands on access to the latest generation of electrical motor drive technology
8106858 we hoped this lab could be fully equipped in time for the students return next month and this donation helps us achieve that
8106859 this is giving back and an investment in a shared vision of the critical importance of educating power electronics engineers able to help lead companies like abb into ever brighter technological frontiers
8106860 so it is particularly satisfying and important to continue to support an academic institution m1 that is graduating this level of talent
8106861 students will program the drives and operate motors that simulate real world installations and loads
8106862 beyond an introduction to the technology they drill on into the equipments performance characteristics in order to understand what control features they will be able to access modify and offer customers in the workplace this makes the distance between the academic test lab and an engineering companys application work team very short
8106863 are industry oriented to give students real world experience that distinguishes them from graduates of other universities
8106864 dtc delivers full torque twisting power to a motor at zero speed and in engineer speak that is a remarkable capability
8106865 so new that they continue to be in introduction to the marketplace now
8106866 brian comes to msoe already having experience as a collegiate head coach which will be a first for our mens volleyball program
8106867 that is a significant step for a program only five years old we are trying to further develop it as we are now entering the midwest intercollegiate volleyball association miva a prestigious conference for mens volleyball we feel brian will be able to take us to the next level
8106868 to win this award for the third year in a row and to have the highest gpa of any team that has ever won this award is incredible
8106869 the programs at msoe arent easy and that makes us appreciate this award even more once again these guys proved that if you make a total commitment to both your academic and athletic pursuits you can be successful in both
8106870 the fact that he now has an international championship to go along with his lake michigan conference championship is incredible
8106871 i am delighted that we have been able to secure an experienced professional like rai stelter to coordinate the operation of the kern center
8106872 he comes to us highly recommended and will bring great leadership to our recreational program the kern center will be the gem of our campus and rai is just the person to take on the challenge of running it
8106873 were pleased that the faa recognized the quality of our program and chose to enter into this agreement with the university said dr
8106874 it will be of benefit to both the students and faa
8106875 there is a critical and growing demand for qualified technical staff in the faa
8106876 we believe our partnership with msoe will help meet that demand
8106877 what wisdom would you try to impart to the world if you knew it was your last chance
8106878 really achieving your childhood dreams and how he worked to achieve his childhood dreams
8106879 there is a very thin line between being dismissed and becoming a field marshal in 1971 when pakistan cracked down in east pakistan hundreds and thousands of refugees started pouring into india into west bengal assam and tripura the prime minister held a cabinet meeting in her office i was then summoned a very angry grim faced prime minister read out telegrams from the chief ministers of west bengal assam and tripura she then turned around to me and said what are you doing about it and i said nothing its got nothing to do with me you didnt consult me when you allowed the bsf the crp and raw to encourage the pakistanis to revolt now that you are in trouble you come to me i have a long nose i know whats happening she said i want you to enter pakistan and i responded that means war she said i do not mind if it is war i said are you prepared i am certainly not this is the end of april the himalayan passes are opening and there can be an attack from china i turned around to the prime minister and said that the rains were about to start in east pakistan and when it rains there it pours and the whole countryside is flooded the snows are melting the rivers would become like oceans all my movement would be confined to roads
8106880 now prime minister give me your orders the grim prime minister with her teeth clenched said the cabinet will meet again at four oclock
8106881 the extension of the quiz to 16 locations is reflective of new india and the emergence of the smaller cities as key business destinations
8106882 i am very proud of both the athletic and academic achievements of this team said head coach kevin morin
8106883 we have proven that if you make a total commitment to both your academic and athletic pursuits you can be successful in both areas this team defines what it means to be true scholar athletes and that is what msoe wrestling is all about
8106884 most of the students that dont receive aid dont file for it
8106885 even if you dont qualify for academic scholarships there is so much aid out there institutional aid other scholarships federal aid grants just dont decline it
8106886 certain funds are limited such as work study and the funds go fast
8106887 at msoe we have a financial aid calculator online between october and january at www msoe edu finaid
8106888 there are some questions on the fasfa that require tax numbers from the current year
8106889 if you file for the fafsa online it will be more accurate the online version can detect mistakes and have you correct them right away its a huge time saver
8106890 in 2002 2003 there was 700 000 worth of private scholarships available for students students should start looking the summer before their senior year the money is out there
8106891 we start with the financial aid estimator and then our admissions office reminds students to seek aid by mailing fasfa reminders the student financial services office then meets with parents and students and goes through the entire financial aid package one on one
8106892 financial aid can be confusing and we want to make it as easy a process as possible
8106893 why shows like farscape firefly and odyssey 5 are cancelled
8106894 from its inception leaders of business and industry supported the universitys development and maintained a close relationship that has continued throughout its history it still is an institution dedicated to education excellence poised on the cutting edge of technology and positioned as a national and international leader among the worlds universities
8106895 in 1903 there was a great need for technically educated employees who could step into productive roles in industry
8106896 our young engineering school thrived and now the university offers bachelors and masters degrees in engineering business nursing and several specialty programs the campus grew from a single borrowed classroom to a dozen buildings in downtown milwaukee it offers programs in wisconsin through outreach efforts and internationally through exchange programs this award recognizes the efforts of many regents faculty staff students and alumni together we share our appreciation
8106897 this is a great honor to an athlete who personifies a stellar work ethic on and off the field
8106898 i dont think you can find a more deserving student athlete this is a great day for rick and the msoe soccer program
8106899 wisconsins private colleges and universities are committed to making college affordable
8106900 it is no wonder more students are participating every year
8106901 exposure to this collection will help open students eyes to the historical evolution of work from its early modest beginnings and allow them to better understand the roots of todays production processes
8106902 the beneficiaries of dr grohmanns generosity are the msoe students faculty staff and all those who will be exposed to this collection through visits to campus or through the book
8106903 it will be of ongoing value to all of msoe

8106910 you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain
8106911 your task is not to seek for love but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it
8106912 lovers dont meet somewhere along the way they are in each other all along
8106913 i truly feel that we won this competition because of the hard work and countless hours of preparation that we put into the design and fabrication phases
8106914 over the past 9 months our team put anywhere from 800 to 1 000 hours of work into this buv when we started this project our goals were to win the competition raise awareness for the buv project on campus and have fun as a team we accomplished these goals and then some

8106922 the need to recruit todays students into this new career track comes at the same time that the number of u s students choosing careers in science is decreasing theres an urgent need for new science education outreach programs that introduce students to the excitement of the molecular biosciences at a time when they are making initial career decisions
8106923 the development of this degree opens engineering up to more individuals especially those already working full time

8106954 im not so sure x could be caused by factors y or z as well
8106955 trying to bring awareness of the tibet movement is something someone in my position can do
8106956 the option of non attendance in the event that there is no resumption of dialogue between the chinese authorities and his holiness the dalai lama
8106957 given that these talks have to date proved inconclusive i have decided not to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games
8106958 but i very much hope that the dialogue between the envoys of the dalai lama and the chinese authorities will soon be pursued in a constructive way aimed at achieving results the dalai lama has always called for non violent protest and has rejected calls for tibetan independence he has instead proposed the middle way of cultural autonomy and religious freedom for tibet and has never questioned chinas territorial integrity he has the full support of the european parliament for his approach we expect that china will respect its own public commitments to human rights and minority rights announced when the decision to allow china to organise the games was taken this is a great opportunity for china to open itself up to the world and to demonstrate that it is committed to internationally recognised fundamental rights
8106959 for your mission and your people at this critical time
8106960 i hope that this letter and your meeting with senator mccain will make clear that american attention to and backing for the people of tibet is widespread and transcends the divisions of our political contest in this important election year
8106961 i urge the chinese leaders to engage in talks and make progress with his holiness representatives in addressing the just grievances of the tibetan people i urge the chinese government to release tibetan political prisoners and account for tibetans who have disappeared since the protests in march and engage in meaningful dialogue and genuine autonomy for tibet
8106962 the olympics next month should be a time for china to demonstrate to the world that it is committed to respecting the basic human rights of its people the united states welcomes good relations with china but it does no service to the chinese government and certainly no service to the people of china for the united states and other democracies to pretend that the suppression of rights in china does not concern us it does will and must concern us
8106963 this time my visit is non political my old friend now one of the candidates for president of this great country and i had the opportunity of meeting indeed i feel great great honor and he was showing genuine concern about democracy human rights religious freedom and environment issue in china in general and particularly in tibets case and i explained the up to date situation they both showed genuine concern and interest so thank you very much
8106964 thank you your holiness that is not an endorsement that is a statement of the incredible power and influence of this unique citizen of the world
8106965 threatening to boycott the ceremony may be the only way to get concrete results
8106966 if europe does not take a stand the chinese government will be able to dismiss future european union demands to improve human rights
8106967 french president nicolas sarkozy has said clearly that he will not attend the ceremony unless talks resume between the government and representatives of the dalai lama

8106970 microsoft partners however say the plans are already in place foradding new licensing options to softgrid that would make it more of a head to headcompetitor with web based applications like google docs
8106971 i was beaten for two hours with sticks and kicked all over

8106975 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8106976 its not like we can say this guy is that much better than that guy
8106977 it is my hope that the house of representatives will send a clear message that we support the fundamental freedoms of the tibetan people and a peaceful solution to the instability in tibet
8106978 it is long past time for beijing to reassess its failed policy to attack and demonize the dalai lama and show the world it can have civilized discussions as a responsible world power
8106979 if the chinese government is ever to treat its people with basic human rights it must be sent a bold and clear message that its record of violence and suppression is completely unacceptable
8106980 we urge you not to attend the opening ceremonies in beijing this summer
8106981 if the chinese do not take steps to help stop the genocide in darfur and to respect the dignity security and human rights of the tibetan people then the president should boycott the opening ceremonies
8106982 to allow foreign journalists and diplomats access to the region tibet and to engage the dalai lama in meaningful talks about the future of tibet
8106983 believes the president should evaluate the situation as it evolves and ought to keep his options open
8106984 he continues to condemn the brutal oppression that the chinese inflicted on the tibetans and protestors around the world
8106985 i wanted to commend prime minister gordon brown for agreeing not to go to the opening ceremonies of the olympics in beijing that was an important decision by prime minister brown and i am calling on sens mccain and obama to join me in my request that president bush also not attend the opening ceremonies
8106986 kyle field is as good an environment as you get in college football
8106987 from a fan participation standpoint to a facility standpoint the whole bit its a great environment
8106988 there are a lot of things we have to clean up we started making the players adjust to a lot of things that they might see during the course of the game different calls on the offensive line and in the secondary different motions or formations that they might have to adjust to things that we dont necessarily know theyre going to do but to just apply the rules and make the calls we had to stop coach and teach at some points during that but overall it wasnt a bad day
8106989 i find it odd how you celebrate the day a bunch of rebels told you off
8106990 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8106991 at the moment we are receiving very little information there are restrictions on telephone calls into tibet and coming out
8106992 the police question and beat any tibetan they want i have seen this with my own eyes
8106993 provides for no kind of demonstration or political religious or racial propaganda in the olympic sites venues or other areas
8106994 there are all sorts of organisations who would like athletes to use the olympic games as a vehicle to publicise their causes i dont believe that is in the interest of the team performance we are ambassadors of the country and we have to conform to an appropriate code of conduct
8106995 were not trying to gag athletes if an athlete gets asked a direct question they will be allowed to answer that question but there is a difference between giving an honest answer to actually going out to make a specific political point
8106996 this is something new thats what people fight wars for fucking resources

8107006 earlier mr saakashvili had told the times that russia was trying to build up forces near akhalgori only 20 miles 32km from tbilisi
8107007 we wish to make a request of the russian government in view of its invasion of georgia russia holds us government debt instruments which provide a regular flow of income to the russian government russian government funds in turn are now being used to finance violation of georgian sovereignty by russian armed forces in an attempt to overthrow a democratically elected government this puts the united states in an awkward situation on the one hand american taxpayers are not accustomed to financing aggression on the other hand to stop payment on us agency debt instruments held by the russian government would be legally problematic and might damage the credit rating of the united states accordingly we request that the russian government sell all us agency debt instruments within a reasonable time period in order to extricate the us from a situation which us taxpayers may regard as morally compromising russian compliance with this request will be appreciated

8107065 it is not good enough for the commissioners to shrug off their obligation to consider the national and environmental benefits of wind farms by saying they could be built somewhere else
8107066 apart from the three wind farms now almost complete all other projects are just
8107067 the reality is that the commissioners decision lowers new zealands wind generation potential that means we are going to continue to be reliant on the thermal generation that has played a significant role in our increasing carbon emissions
8107068 a good deal of new zealand is well suited to wind farming and there seems to be a lot of interest in clean independent energy that protects people from rising prices and blackouts were talking to some private investors to help take us through to sales there are some good people behind us including the foundation for research science and technology which just this week committed to back us for the development of a 22 kilowatt wind turbine
8107069 mr oliver needs to get his line straight on this issue as a man with a high profile in another part of public life people expect a much better level of contribution from mr oliver he has an obligation to debate the issue fairly and factually
8107070 cost effective efficient and are certainly among the cleanest ways to produce the electricity that each of us use
8107071 turbine suppliers cant ship their products out the door fast enough
8107072 we disagree with the councils assessments of the degree of adverse effects that is not a criticism of its decision making processes the evidence put before us was significantly more fulsome and detailed on those issues
8107073 we respect the environment courts decision because it comes out of a very thorough and comprehensive process on subjective matters like landscape values a different decision maker can place more or less weight on particular elements and come up with a different conclusion
8107074 this was just the kind of project new zealand needs to reduce its skyrocketing emissions and eventually achieve a 100 per cent switch to renewable energy
8107075 zealand has an abundant wind resource and utilising it together with other renewable energy sources and with increasing energy efficiency means we can stop depending on dwindling and dirty supplies of fossil fuels
8107076 renewable energy is a safe simple and obvious key part of the solution to climate change
8107077 project west wind effectively avoids pumping out a half million tonnes of co2 annually and emissions reductions from the project will save new zealand up to 26 million in avoiding the purchase of emissions reductions under the kyoto protocol 1
8107078 this is a great example of the resource management act doing its job in assessing the local impacts and the contribution that renewable energy projects can make to tackling climate change the greatest challenge facing the planet
8107079 im not considering pulling the plug that is quite wrong
8107080 secondly it is quite wrong to say this project may not go ahead we are quite confident that it will go ahead
8107081 we do have to reflect broader national policy into these decisions but its quite difficult the way the rma resource management act is set up
8107082 the snowtown stage one project will provide trustpower with a beachhead into the australian electricity market
8107083 stage one will use only about one third of the available wind farm site leaving the opportunity for further stages in the future
8107084 my clear instructions are that an expanded wind farm is not part of meridians current wind development programme
8107085 meridian soundly rejects any inference or suggestion that it has been anything other than open to this point
8107086 mr whitney has consistently played down or disputed the benefits of the project and sought every opportunity to disagree with evidence presented by the applicant and supporting submitters
8107087 could cause significant risks for new zealands security of electricity supply

8107093 enough evidence for the jury to find the defendants guilty
8107094 he wanted to stuff the money up in the toilet and couldnt find a rubber glove to do it
8107095 because you didnt want anyone to know about this so a report that omits material facts is accurate
8107096 were not going to put jokes in our police report
8107097 im not going to say i lied on my tax returns
8107098 we had absolutely no intention of doing anything with that money other than turn it in

8107102 a high alert has been sounded in the jammu due to the infiltration of three terrorists from across the international border security forces have launched a massive search operation in the entire area
8107103 it is an important find because we have found over the years several tombs that have been looted but never one that was intact
8107104 a multiple tomb in which three funeral bundles were found one has an impressive mask with the human characteristics of a woman
8107105 it is a woman because in the surrounding area we found offerings and textile items like those of a female weaver

8107110 by all means go check out some other places and then let me know
8107111 well were making our decision in about a week and a half
8107112 the pilot relayed to the aiport head that the hijackers do not want any negotiations and they have only one demand that the plane be refuelled to go to paris
8107113 the hijackers also rejected the airport request that passengers who had fainted because of inadequate air conditioning in the plane be given medical treatment
8107114 they said they belong to slms abdel wahed nur who lives in paris they had coordinated with him to meet them in the french capital
8107115 we took no part in this hijacking at all it is completely against our aims values and objectives we condemn this hijacking with a strong voice
8107116 the pilot also informed the airport director that the hijackers numbered 10 before he came back to say their number could be more than that
8107117 we had three senior members on the plane and some other people they got on and someone hijacked it
8107118 about half an hour after takeoff a hijacker demanded to go to cairo as a destination
8107119 oh im going to go for the big shot from my teammate thatll show them

8107121 i am very happy to be back healthy playing well and winning the first round is always great fun
8107122 but its been a hard year especially the beginning and it was difficult trying to get back into rhythm
8107123 i played really well on clay and grass but not so good early on in the hardcourt sesason i think the olympics doubles gold gave me a great lift and i am really inspired to do well here
8107124 do you need anything else or what there are a bunch of people behind you

8107126 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
8107127 tivo had just sort of taken off this was four or five seasons ago and because we were on friday nights most people most fans dont watch it on first run they tivo it and watch it a zillion times
8107128 in fact i dont think we ever go into space
8107129 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
8107130 under mysterious circumstances must be seen against a background of increasing pressure by chinese authorities on tibetans before the olympics the government is in fact trying to rid itself of all those social elements who might cause problems
8107131 the lack of religious freedom and the tight restrictions imposed by the chinese government on how tibetan buddhism is practiced tend to drive many monks to desperation some end up take desperate measures however in this particular case we are not sure that the two monks actually took their own lives they did not talk about it to anyone and did not leave any message
8107132 getting worse by the day as the beijing olympics approach the central authorities have given strict instructions to communist leaders in tibet who use violence and whatever means necessary to maintain security and impose the so called social harmony but this does nothing more than exacerbate the situation because if our monks can come so close to desperation the crisis in tibets population is not far off

8107162 construction of new stupas is banned tibetan devotees are not even allowed to circumnambulate temples and stupas
8107163 we were also told that monks should not be allowed to stay in our houses
8107164 theres an incredible increase in the inclination to read even the slightest incident as an attack by the dalai lama or the dalai clique on the state in other words they see these things as organized
8107165 policies to control and restrict tibetan culture and tibetan religion in an aggressive way
8107166 so these are security measures but theyre done through policy means
8107167 the sources of the problem are seen as being tibetan culture and tibetan religion that produce nationalism
8107168 i dont think theres any precedent for chinese cadres at the village level
8107169 another contingent is being recruited in kongpo and being trained to criticize the dalai lama
8107170 beijing says that tibetans are free to practice their religion but on the ground talking freely to individuals foreign journalists would see the lie to this as beijing maintains a sustained attack on buddhism by imposing control and conditions on religion

8107281 so wie die h here tierart von den untergeordneten gebilden der tiere auf dem physischen gebiete sich unterscheiden so unterscheidet sich die seele des genies von der seele des hottentotten auf seelischem gebiete
8107282 wer mit offenem geistesauge die entwickelung der menschheit verfolgt der wei dass es innerhalb des geisteslebens der menschheit ebenso eine entwickelung gibt wie innerhalb der physischen natur so wie es innerhalb der physischen natur wesenheiten gibt die im dunklen tappen und andere die im dunklen tappen und au erdem h ren und so weiter so gibt es auch im geistigen leben alle abstufungen zwischen der unentwickelten seele eines hottentotten und der genie seele eines goethe oder newton wir sehen also welch gewaltige unterschiede bestehen sowohl in der abstufung der sinnesentwickelung als auch in der skala der geistesentwickelung es gibt hochentwickelte naturen in der menschheit und diejenigen weiche sie gefunden haben wissen davon zeugnis abzulegen diese gro en naturen sind die f hrer in der geistigen entwickelung
8107283 sie k nnen ein bedeutender europ ischer bildungsmensch sein wenn sie aber zu den hottentotten ihre bildung tragen wollen m ssen sie die hottentottensprache lernen so m ssen auch hohe wesenheiten die heruntersteigen wenn sie die menschheit f hren wollen sich einverweben die kr fte durch die sie auf der erde zu den menschen sprechen k nnen
8107284 da haben wir in allem was wir als saturn rasse zu bezeichnen haben in allem dem wir den saturn charakter beizumessen haben etwas zu suchen was sozusagen zusammenf hrt zusammenschlie t das was wieder der abendd mmerung der menschheit zuf hrt deren entwickelung in gewisser weise zum abschluss bringt und zwar zu einem wirklichen abschluss zu einem hinsterben wie sich das wirken auf das dr sensystem ausdr ckt sehen wir an der indianischen rasse darauf beruht die sterblichkeit derselben ihr verschwinden der saturn einfluss wirkt durch alle anderen systeme zuletzt auf das dr sensystem ein das sondert aus die h rtesten teile des menschen und man kann daher sagen dass dieses hinsterben in einer art verkn cherung besteht wie dies im u eren doch deutlich sich offenbart sehen sie sich doch die bilder der alten indianer an und sie werden gleichsam mit h nden greifen k nnen den geschilderten vorgang in dem niedergang dieser rasse

8107286 l sst man ihn das stark merken du bist kein solch au erordentlicher kerl solche exemplare gibt es viele die das oder jenes erleben dann ist das eine sehr starke beeintr chtigung der impulse die gerade zur melancholie f hren deshalb ist es gut ihn besonders mit biographien gro er pers nlichkeiten zu behandeln

8107336 der kenner der p dagogischen psychologie und ihrer umfangreichen entwicklungsforschung steht verbl fft vor diesem kargen modell und fragt sich vergeblich wie ein renommiertes schulsystem seit ber sechzig jahren unbek mmert um die fortschritte der wissenschaft danach arbeiten kann m glicherweise liegt gerade in der anspruchslosigkeit des ger tes seine durchschlagskraft dieses kann schlie lich jeder begreifen und handhaben auch ohne p dagogische examen m glicherweise liegt sie auch in der okkulten ableitung des ganzen oder aber in der schier unbegreiflichen ministeriellen duldung und f rderung

8107354 eine waldorfschule die auf der grundlage der von andreas molau vertretenen denkrichtung aufbaut kann und wird es niemals geben
8107355 die fehlende mitgliedschaft im bund der freien waldorfschulen bedeutet z b dass es weder eine offizielle teilhabe an der anerkannten lehrerbildung der waldorfschulen noch qualit t sichernde beziehungen gibt
8107356 der ruf der waldorfschule steht auf dem spiel pr gelstrafe ist seit der gr ndung der waldorfschule verp nt diese schule in kempten der verf war immer schon auf einem sonderweg unterwegs und hat eine sehr eigenwillige interpretation der waldorfp dagogik
8107357 aber eines m chte ich sie doch bitten dass sie es recht ber cksichtigen das w re das dass wir als lehrerschaft selbst was die anderen machen durch die kinder das ist eine sache f r sich dass wir als lehrerschaft versuchen m glichst nicht unsere schulangelegenheiten in die ffentlichkeit hinauszutragen ich bin jetzt erst seit stunden wieder da aber ich habe schon so viel geschw tz geh rt wer eine ohrfeige gekriegt hat und so weiter es geht schon ins grenzenlose dieses geschw tz durch die leute hindurch dass es mir schrecklich war nicht wahr wir brauchen uns nicht zu k mmern wenn es durch alle m glichen unrichtigen fugen herauskommt da sind wir harth utig dagegen aber tragen wir nur ja nicht selber dazu bei schweigen wir ber alles das was wir handhaben in der schule
8107358 der angeklagte nicht nur t ter sondern auch opfer dieses schulsystems das keine r cksicht darauf nimmt dass ein lehrer ohne p dagogische bef higung solche kinder unterrichtet
8107359 man stellt ihm aufgaben die zu gro sind und versucht ihm klarzumachen wenn er diese bergro en aufgaben l sen muss so ist es deshalb weil er sich hervortun will sie werden sehen dass sie den sch ler nach einiger zeit kuriert haben werden wenn sie diese methoden anwenden
8107360 zum beispiel das festkleben zappelnder kleinkinderh nde mit klebeband an den schultisch das war selbst mir neu der ich schon manches geh rt habe das hundertfache abschreiben von s tzen wie ich darf nicht ist zwar ein sehr alter hut bringt aber in die moderne behinderten p dagogik einen frischen akzent auch das in der ecke stehen m ssen gegebenenfalls bis zum einn ssen geh rt dazu ebenso das ohrenverdrehen haare ziehen und berhaupt die wiedereinf hrung der pr gelstrafe in schwierigen f llen

8107363 die nachfrage nach dieser p dagogik mag frei sein und sich im bewusstsein einer widerrufbaren entscheidung bewegen das angebot selber verlangt devotion und wird nur ausgeliefert wenn es auch konsumiert wird
8107364 das aufnahmeverfahren des bundes hat meistens zu einer erheblichen erleichterung des gr ndungsverfahrens bei der staatlichen schulaufsicht gef hrt es ist mit sicherheit weit sinnvoller und der waldorfp dagogik zutr glicher wenn sich die staatliche schulverwaltung die in der regel keine vorstellung davon hat was eine waldorfschule ist so weit wie m glich in dem verfahren zur cknimmt und stattdessen auf die urteile der zust ndigen organe des bundes zur ckgreift wie dies oft geschieht
8107365 es ist gewi nicht zu leugnen da heute das judentum noch immer als geschlossenes ganzes auftritt und als solches in die entwickelung unserer gegenw rtigen zust nde vielfach ein gegriffen hat und das in einer weise die den abendl ndischen kulturideen nichts weniger als g nstig war das judentum als solches hat sich aber l ngst ausgelebt hat keine berechtigung innerhalb des modernen v lkerlebens und da es sich dennoch erhalten hat ist ein fehler der weltgeschichte dessen folgen nicht ausbleiben konnten wir meinen hier nicht die formen der j dischen religion allein wir meinen vorz glich den geist des judentums die j dische denkweise

8107375 es ist zu bedenken dass ich indirekt auch andere menschen gef hrde wenn ich mein kind nicht gegen masern impfen lasse zudem besteht ein recht des kindes auf optimale f rsorge kindern impfungen zu verweigern deren nutzen wissenschaftlich erwiesen ist ist mangelnde f rsorge

8107424 sieht man vom unzeitgem en vokabular einmal ab findet man bei steiner interessante charakterisierungsversuche kultureller differenzen die er einerseits zu erdeinwirkungen und andererseits zu kosmischen typologien in beziehung setzt
8107425 hinweis das buch setzt sich mit der geschichte auseinander insofern es sich um die inneren und inhaltlichen aspekte der anthroposophie handelt hat der autor eine distanzierte bis ablehnde haltung
8107426 das ist nur zu bef rchten es kann nichts dabei herauskommen also nicht zu viel interne ffentlichkeit f r zander anthroposophen leben vom tun es kann ihnen also nicht viel passieren wenn sie nicht gegen zander auftreten er ist nicht kompetent

8107439 hes a highly skilled forward everybody knows that but hes a hard working classy kid and hell fit right into what were trying to do here
8107440 if you look at nathans history basically from bantam right on through he has a history of scoring big goals in big games thats something you cant teach
8107441 hes learned to play the game defensively and thats what he did a lot last year with the rocket really were getting an even more improved hockey player than was here two years ago
8107442 i wanted to get a couple of more courses in and my goal is to play university hockey
8107443 i felt it was a better decision to get more ice time playing here than i would playing major junior
8107444 ive known him for years and hes always been great to me and my family
8107445 this decision wouldnt have happened without kenny he left this decision to be about me and did not try to guide me in any direction
8107446 the no 1 thing im looking for from nathan is to be that hard working competitor that he is
8107447 he has the real drive competitive spirit hes feisty wants to win and its great to have kids like that
8107448 the biggest thing ill be asking nathan to do even though hes dropping down a level from major junior to tier 2 is continue to work as hard at this level so he can dominate at this level

8107454 if god forbade drinking would he have made wine so good
8107455 beer is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy

8107472 the tibet intergroup appreciates that chinese president hu jintao has made commitments to addressing environmental issues during the october 2007 17th party congress but there must also come the acknowledgement that it is the chinese governments own failure to implement genuine autonomy for the tibetan people that denies them local communities the opportunity to participate meaningfully in environmental decision making and to contest environmental projects tibetans regard as detrimental to their cultural religious and or economic interests
8107473 we must investigate and utilise ngo governmental and international environmental programs that can be applied to tibet and that will provide tibetans with the opportunity to participate in the management of their environment
8107474 the pursuit of international recognition respect and admiration is a top priority of the chinese leadership without the cooperation acceptance and deference of the members of the international community this ambition cannot be achieved world opinion is far from being immaterial to the chinese leadership

8107484 i think the main contents of his anwars policies are sound and they do make sense economically over the long run because it should have a positive impact on malaysias competitiveness
8107485 but i do question his ability to deliver them when and if he does become prime minister given that the opposition coalition that he leads is comprised of three parties with widely differing agendas and ideologies
8107486 to unite our people and forge a clear national direction
8107487 abdullah does not have the minimal credibility needed to run the country day by day let alone to take it in the new directions we need to go in a complex world
8107488 it is time to face the music it is we who have been buried
8107489 i think abdullah should strongly consider for all our sakes to step down now
8107490 two people died in the southeast when their houses collapsed
8107491 a strong energetic and far sighted civil defense protects our people and offers them more security from disasters than in the united states
8107492 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region
8107493 given the current track for gustav and the expectation that it might enter the gulf of mexico this weekend we are making logistical arrangements to evacuate staff who are not essential to production or drilling operations
8107494 evacuations could begin as early as wednesday there is no impact on production at this time

8107498 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8107499 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8107500 its a bit of a blow but i think people are making more of a kid whos 22 years of age and has played 19 games
8107501 it would have helped our structure but having said that hes only played seven or eight games this year and we have coped ok without him
8107502 theres a fair bit of pressure on the young lad and its more unfortunate for him that he didnt get up
8107503 he was pretty devastated on monday i think its the fact hes had so many injuries and i think the best thing for him is to get his shoulder done so he can have a good pre season and hopefully get an uninterrupted next year
8107504 there are many lessons that can be drawn from the asthma epidemic and the subsequent research that led to unravelling the problem not least the importance of publicly funding innovative health research that may be at odds with current thinking and dogma
8107505 a compelling book that describes the real life events surrounding the identification of fenoterol as the causative agent behind the asthma mortality epidemic
8107506 it wasnt until i read the book that i realised how close we came to losing polly
8107507 nothing less than the fate of our country hangs in the balance

8107518 due to continued high fuel prices weak freight demand and escalating operating costs as well as a tight credit market priority will be phasing out of most of its over the road operations which include its trucking operations in farmington n y and chesterton ind we have entered into an agreement with celadon to assist in the wind down of operations and to help ensure continuity of customer service
8107519 we are delighted with the opportunity to assist priority and its customers in an orderly transition of business in this situation a strong carrier can provide needed stability for all involved and we believe celadon fits that role on a longer term basis one of our goals is to continue to broaden our customer base with quality customers and add density in our primary traffic lanes we believe that celadon can enhance service to prioritys customers through an upgraded equipment fleet excellent technology more available assets for dispatch and an outstanding safety record further celadon is a smartway transport partner with the highest score possible from the standpoint of fuel efficiency through its international operations in canada and mexico celadon can provide a broader range of service to prioritys customers

8107531 we tell local governments all disasters are local but it is important that theyre not by themselves
8107532 once the county is declared for individual assistance we will put out that 1 800 621 fema number to people who registered thats important well send an inspector out to their home to determine how much damage theyre eligible for and then we will issue them a check right away sometimes it turns around within 24 hours
8107533 we expect within 24 hours this is my hope we request the president and others who have to act on that to act on that

8107549 i didnt get into this business to do the same thing over and over
8107550 its an attempt to put my destiny in my own hands
8107551 being a producer allows me to develop material that says something to me to make movies i can be proud of
8107552 if we characterized one side as all good or all bad you could write off the film as just another piece of action pabulum
8107553 i see it as a movie about truth we wanted to tell an entertaining story but also to bring out other issues issues that usually get ignored
8107554 one of the things that being an actor affords me is to travel around the world on somebody elses dime youre getting paid to study other people other disciplines other religions
8107555 what ive found is that most human beings no matter what they believe want the same things safety for their kids protection a roof food
8107556 hes this very religious man who is never unsure of his relationship to god but that faith comes in conflict with what he sees as his duty i see him as a good guy but a good guy who has killed innocent people by his actions he really feels the burden of that hes violating one of the main tenants of his faith
8107557 pretty much left us alone to make the movie we wanted
8107558 you know if you have the money you can make whatever movie you like but successfully steering your film through the process of marketing and interfacing with the moviegoing audience thats tricky
8107559 i thought talk to me was a really good movie and maybe 11 people saw it i didnt want that to happen here
8107560 what was an appropriate gift for people who married after living together for twenty years
8107561 a root ball the tough strings of love tangled with those of dependence and habit the whole heavy mass clotted here and there with disappointment and accommodation as well as satisfaction and joy
8107562 they said to her youre not good enough for him and youre ugly
8107563 i can see why people want to keep things to themselves
8107564 dont come home a drinkin with lovin on your mind
8107565 i was just writin about what i was goin through is all
8107566 but what made those songs hits is that other women were going through the same things but back then women just didnt talk about such things a song like fist city about 80 percent of all women have probably been in that situation
8107567 usually theres a speck of truth in there surrounded by a bunch of lies
8107568 a lot of changes are made a lot of scenes are taken out or done differently just because you havent gotten into your flow of directing yet or what you like on the set
8107569 but im pretty cool with it all every set has its own vibe i just adapt
8107570 it is available now a number of museums have already purchased it including the american museum of natural history in new york the brooklyn childrens museum the field museum in chicago and the san diego natural history museum also in a short while it will be available on amazon com through oytoys com

8107591 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible im so happy we are still in a state of shock
8107592 im just staying super healthy i have moved down to the beach with tito i love being by the beach
8107593 i think im going to stay unmarried and just go for the babies im following in angelinas footsteps

8107599 i have the greatest husband hes so awesome its fun to have somebody that i love to do this with the baby is my main focus right now were both so excited i mean this is definitely the happiest moment in my life
8107600 my mom and my grandmother have given me good motherly advice but its one of those things where your mother instincts kind of kick in right away
8107601 i dont think its something well decide until the baby comes
8107602 i think if youre best friends with someone and you act like youre a kid sometimes your love will stay young
8107603 we tell each other everything and we act like kids we go to the carnival and disney world and dave and busters arcades all the time
8107604 its cool because we are all dating twins even my sister is dating a twin david katzenberg is a twin my cousin is dating an identical twin so we all date twins and we all hang out its pretty interesting
8107605 i dont think theres been any quarterback in this league that hasnt had ups and downs
8107606 theres going to be better days you have to continue to come to work with the right attitude and get better because if you dont i think thats how things tend to spiral down
8107607 i think its too easy to get negative to get down and im not going to do that
8107608 just going to take a different approach to this im still young i have to use this time to continue to grow
8107609 i certainly never did have the biggest ego you know its part of the game
8107610 im not thinking about that right now when that time comes in the off season or something well deal with it
8107611 but right now taking on this new role is what it is prepare every day and be ready to go
8107612 weve had zero discussions about alex not being on this football team
8107613 you make a lot of money too and theyre not talking about getting rid of you are they
8107614 you need quarterbacks to win games not just one you need a number of them
8107615 and i have confidence in all three of the guys itd make me nervous to lose him
8107616 we do not discuss individual benefits cases but we can confirm that all resident local families with young children are eligible for certain benefits
8107617 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8107618 nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance i want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day and think about the choices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on your life and on the life of our nation
8107619 my mother was born before women could vote my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8107620 it is the best thing you will ever do in your life
8107621 it just lights up my whole world when max laughs
8107622 being a mother just gives you a whole new sense of purpose and its just the most amazing thing i was in awe of the entire experience of pregnancy the entire journey was just incredible
8107623 in this business it gets crazy the people that you sort of have to weed through with bad intentions or ulterior motives but you have to trust your instincts
8107624 in the end know what youre in it for and its the love of music and the love of what i do so i just have fun with it and really continue to try and soul search and be myself continuously through and through

8107628 something that strikes my heart very closely is the parents and their kids and how parents take responsibility for being the role model that brought their child to this point and seeing how they deal with okay im sort of part of why youre here

8107636 we cannot see our children being killed in our villages or the killing of innocent people and our hope and strong request is to reach a new agreement with the international community which clarifies all the conditions so that in the future the fight against terrorism should happen in the boundary of law so that civilians are not affected
8107637 the afghan people and the afghan government have lost their patience
8107638 we cannot see our children being killed in our villages or the killing of innocent people and our hope and strong request is to reach a new agreement with the international community which clarifies all the conditions so that in the future the fight against terrorism should happen in the boundary of law so that civilians are not affected
8107639 the primary cause of osteoporosis is the high protein diet most americans consume today
8107640 milk it now seems clear is not the solution to poor bone density to the contrary its part of the problem
8107641 the association between the intake of animal protein and fracture rates appears to be as strong as the association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer
8107642 it is hard to turn on the television without hearing commercials suggesting that milk promotes strong bones the commercials do not point out that only 30 percent of milks calcium is absorbed by the body or that osteoporosis is common among milk drinkers nor do they help you correct the real causes of bone loss
8107643 reduced intake of dietary calcium does not seem to be a risk factor
8107644 would like to talk about nutrition as i am heavily involved in this field the vegan diet is without question the ultimate diet for health fitness energy and ethics it is the only truly cruelty free diet and is the diet of world champion athletes anyone who tells you that eating animal protein is good for you knows absolutely nothing about the human body shame on those doctors nutritionists and personal trainers who advise their clients and patients to eat chicken fish and dairy products they let down their entire profession by failing to gain independent nutritional knowledge i lecture in the us and do talks on nutrition in the uk in schools colleges and universities i also lecture to bodybuilders on the great importance of protein the soya bean has no rival containing 40 protein 0 cholesterol amp 0 saturated animal fats it is readily absorbed and contains all the amino acids needed for bodybuilding animal proteins are extremely high in cholesterol and saturated fat which should play no part in a bodybuilders diet nor any kind of athlete or person in general as this is extremely detrimental for a healthy diet to summarise the worst form of protein a bodybuilder can consume is the flesh of animals or the milk of a cow if any bodybuilders are looking for an alternative protein powder in the uk holland and barretts own brand soya isolate is superb and should be recommended for any athlete i put my physique down to my diet i have a high protein diet which is mainly soya and other plant proteins eg tofu soya milk soya yoghurt soya mince legumes plus all fruits and vegetables nut berries seeds etc i have seen bodybuilders who have trained on a meat and dairy diet and then changed to a vegan diet and the achievements have been extreme strength gains as well as muscular development due to consuming a better quality of protein the health benefits are also just as gratifying i e loss of body fat gains in energy and better skin tone to conclude there is no opposition to the quality of soya protein especially relating to a bodybuilder
8107645 although fish and fish oil capsules have been promoted for their omega 3 fatty acids as a means of lowering heart disease risk these acids have highly unstable molecules that decompose quickly and unleash free radicals free radicals are damaging to living tissues and cells but that damage can be prevented by antioxidants the kinds of fatty acids found in vegetables fruits and beans lower free radical activity while increasing antioxidant levels when you choose vegetarian foods you naturally and safely lower your risk for heart disease and other serious illnesses you get twice the level of protection every time you eat

8107649 the scale of the holocaust and the way the nazis did it maybe that would never happen again but its happening on a smaller scale
8107650 kids say that could never happen today then i start talking about sierra leone and darfur it gets the students to really think about that maybe i can get the majority of students to think about it and have empathy empathy is the key to avoiding hatred i believe
8107651 any time we can actually experience some of these things it adds to the experience we can provide for the kids in instruction
8107652 i had some really strong feelings when i was standing at birkenau thinking that my speakers were there
8107653 thats where the crematoria where the gassed bodies were burned were located
8107654 what we have been able to glean is that the journalists the canadian the australian and the somali are unharmed they have their clothes theyre getting food regularly and they may even have access to satellite tv
8107655 i cant say more than that you can understand that the group may be afraid of a possible armed mission to rescue the journalists
8107656 but the way things have gone in somalia from what we know and from what weve seen in the past thats not necessarily a bad thing that theres been no demand yet
8107657 in the case of some italian aid workers kidnapped a while ago in somalia it took seven to 10 days before any contact was made so you see were still early on
8107658 somalia is a dangerous place there are a lot of various factions and many of them have guns its a confusing place

8107663 you dont have all the data i think thats what makes the openers always exciting
8107664 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8107665 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8107666 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8107667 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8107668 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8107669 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8107670 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8107671 this is a significant racketeering case involving alleged criminal activity spanning the globe
8107672 we could not know in 1968 even that in our graduating class was the future governor of new jersey and future head of the environmental protection agency an agency that did not exist in 1968 we could not know that at another all womens college 35 miles away was a student who would be running for the democratic nomination for president 40 years later nor that her primary opponent in the primary would be a then seven year old son of a black kenyan father and white mother from kansas
8107673 yet for all of our progress we note the problem of prejudice based on race gender disability and age has not gone away in its mutated forms discrimination is more subtle less intentional and more unconscious than it was in 1968 and in an important sense more resilient
8107674 the unintended forms of prejudice unfortunately are not only learned culturally re enforced and complicated motivated by complicated psychological needs they are also built right into our normal processes of cognition
8107675 overcoming them will require an extraordinary combination of individual effort optimism self criticism and knowledge
8107676 wheaton has given you many opportunities to prepare for these and other challenges here you have learned about leadership which will never be obsolete no matter what lies ahead
8107677 over the next 40 years some of you will become public figures some will work in the frontiers of science and technology or be leaders in business and finance
8107678 what do you want to be able to have said about you in five years in 10 years or 40 years from today when you return for your 40th wheaton reunion
8107679 george eliot told us it is never too late to be who you might have been
8107680 you now enter the 40 year period during which you will live your answers to these questions i will see you in 40 years for a full report
8107681 my many years have taught me there will always be conflicts its part of human nature but i will remind you that love kindness and support are also part of human nature my challenge to all of you is to bring about a mindset of preparing for peace instead of preparing for war
8107682 it is precisely because of the al yamamah complication that i urge a halt in the drive to remove president musharraf from power the bandar crowd in saudi arabia should not be allowed to control the destiny of pakistan and that is exactly where we are headed if musharrafs removal is allowed there is a serious narco terrorist factor to deal with centered around the taliban and al qaeda nexus which enjoys continuing support from the relevant british and saudi factions
8107683 they will wreak havoc on the entire region and that does not serve u s or regional interests in the least
8107684 the bush white house is absolutely indifferent to the situation on the ground
8107685 it is looking more and more like the white house has been outright bought up by the saudis judging from some of the policies coming out of bush and company
8107686 president musharrafs regrettable retirement will only make matters worse and for that i hold president bush and the bush white house responsible any serious american president would have put his foot down and demanded that the saudis and their british allies stop the interference in the pakistan situation
8107687 musharraf was the only leader who could maintain stability in an extremely complex country like pakistan restrain radical islamists and guarantee that the nuclear potential would remain under control the so called oppositions corrupt leaders let out of an anglo american jar hate each other and are incapable of ensuring either in the view of responsible american analysts the pakistani bomb is much more dangerous than the non existent iranian one who gets it and what happens to this not quite low priority and not the least populated region this is what the united states european partners should be thinking about not about the moaning of a whipped georgian paranoid man
8107688 the whole thing was obvious to me it was obvious in the discussions i had with people that while pakistan was already a mess by this concession of dumping musharraf you actually unleash all the instabilities in the area and pakistan is a nuclear power in a sense but the more significant thing is that the whole thing was done by the saudis thats what has to be said and this thing is an anglo american saudi operation
8107689 the saudi bandar al yamamah operation is whats key here and the whole region is in trouble because the saudis are the center of the whole destabilization of the region its a saudi british operation in which prince bandar is crucial the bush family is deeply indebted in a sense to these saudi types the corruption goes right inside the united states government the bandar saudi operation and the bush connections to that are absolutely crucial
8107690 leontyev is right hes absolutely correct its just that hes left out this one part that this is a case in which the london saudi operation the bae connected operation is the key monster in this thing which is a controlling factor in the u s behavior you dont need to have a president barack obama because the real presidency is the saudi monarchy the white house is a dependency of the saudi monarchy
8107691 this is not a situation that lends itself to a military solution
8107692 has a longer track record than that he is a legendary entrepreneur
8107693 i enjoyed the opportunity to meet senator obama and discuss an issue that is americas top priority which is ending our dependence on foreign oil i assured obama that this is a non partisan campaign we discussed my plan and the opportunities to create jobs grow our economy and revitalize americas heartland by using private capital he was very engaged
8107694 who would have thought last year that me and t boone pickens would be in the same swift boat pulling the same oar the same way
8107695 in west texas pickens has begun his multibillion dollar project for the biggest baddest wind farm ever
8107696 i think its really significant that one of the most successful oil industry figures is now investing a billion dollars of his own money in windmills just this past week we saw texas approve massive new transmission lines to use wind power as a substitute for the old sic ways of producing electricity

8107705 where is the logic in spending more to prohibit cannabis than the social cost to society from cannabis
8107706 this issue needs no petition when over 370 000 new zealanders used cannabis in 2006 the jury is in the studies are done now is the time to act
8107707 does labour have the mettle to shake off the shackles of that flotilla of parasite parties and do one last bold act include the cannabis question in the referendum

8107710 we would hope that the faa will continue to discuss the matter with us in good faith as we have been doing all along
8107711 i was reading the wall street journal and they have decided preschool is harmful to children obama is wanting to form a national preschool system and we all know preschool was invented by the soviet union to make better communists the government took children away from their parents and the kids barely knew who their parents were

8107726 sev turned us on to levon helm s album dirt farmer when we were up at dovetail farm and those songs have been churning through my head ever since levon was the drummer for the band and in my opinion the best voice in their crowd since those days hes whipped up quite a reputation as the gracious host of the midnight ramble sessions a monthly musical throw down in the barn studio at his place in woodstock that has seen the likes of emmylou harris elvis costello levons daughter amy helm of ollabelle lots of stoked attendees and many other marvels this release his first solo studio album in over twenty five years was well worth the wait it came out late last year and im not the only one who thinks its really really good it won a grammy for best traditional folk album and nile loves it too what better credentials need you

8107734 you can never get too comfortable youve got to go out and still be aggressive you cant change your game plan too much but i think theres a point with teams like this that theyre never out of it its a tough team to pitch against

8107769 ibm is an important anchor tenant of the universitys technology park and ibm has attracted additional technology based businesses to ballarat professor battersby said
8107770 ibm has been a key factor in ensuring that the university of ballarats technology park is australias leading regional technology park with 1350 employees across 30 enterprises
8107771 all computer systems old and new have glitches and as i say they have been infrequent
8107772 the cfos claim that the problems with the system can be attributed to poor familiarity is rubbish its got real usability issues the other issue is that it keeps crashing
8107773 an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year old drinking age
8107774 in general alcohol education asserts abstinence in order to be compliant with the law
8107775 this has not produced constructive behavioral change among young people in fact it may contribute to dangerous binge drinking behaviors
8107776 i was a faculty member at the university of pennsylvania when a young woman due to overdrinking fell out a dorm window
8107777 its time to have a conversation about what abuses are what responsibility is and to try to bring some rationality to drinking and not make it like an adventure
8107778 all of us have been bombarded by the same e mail message which is an orchestrated move on the part of madd to complain about the stance were trying to take about the present law
8107779 i moved it all to delete most of us simply believe that the fact that one cannot drink before 21 simply encourages clandestine behavior
8107780 you can get drafted to go to war at 18 but you cant get a fucking beer until youre 21 its absurd
8107781 as a freshman you can get a drink if you want one
8107782 the satisfaction is in acquiring the alcohol you feel bad ass
8107783 when i studied abroad americans were laughed at for blackout drinking
8107784 college presidents arent out to have a more inebriated college population
8107785 i think it would be better to create social pressure rather than legal pressure to be responsible
8107786 during that time there was an increase in the problem of drinking at high school level
8107787 one of the other things we know from studies is the younger they are when they start to drink the more likely they are to develop alcohol problems in later life
8107788 ive seen no evidence that lowering the drinking age is going to result in less drinking its like the idea of getting rid of speeding by eliminating speed limits
8107789 i dont see the logic in saying that because alcohol is there among school age children we should make it easier
8107790 i think the trend is growing more and more to holding colleges liable for injuries that happen related to alcohol
8107791 fraternities are a big target most are gross negligence suits
8107792 its definitely something they pay attention to and are concerned about
8107793 that wasnt the first or second thing that crossed my mind
8107794 we enforce the law and put it in our student handbook we try to have as much oversight as we can while the students are on campus so i wasnt really worried about that liability
8107795 we are very much in favor of a discussion of binge drinking and are well aware of the problem
8107796 its not really clear lowering the drinking age will address the issue the presidents preference is to look at alternative solutions
8107797 a good public debate informed by facts and not by anecdotes
8107798 when students cant drink openly it means they are less likely to discuss drinking problems
8107799 even when i fail you i know you love me
8107800 nos ltimos anos muitos me desvalorizaram mas n o me interessa sei o que posso fazer e o que quero obter
8107801 if the democratic party was going to honestly acknowledge how it came to the point in its history that it was about to nominate a black american for president no speech would not mention lyndon johnson
8107802 the ideals that jfk so nobly represented must now be made into effective action
8107803 i was actually pleased with how we played defensively especially in the second half
8107804 we defended as a team when we had to but wed like to improve our effort when we get the ball
8107805 my boys didnt back down at all i was happy to see that
8107806 he made a lot of things look a lot easier than they were
8107807 he made a couple of fantastic saves and after he made those we didnt have any composure in front of the net
8107808 they held strong and they kept us outside and taking shots we normally pass up for something better
8107809 lexington catholics got a pretty good team and i think ive got a pretty good team too
8107810 well both be a whole lot better in a couple of months

8107820 its a way for companies that are in need of technology to find an outlet for their products we now have a mechanism for the exchange of ideas a tool of communication where anyone regardless of where they are on the globe can become a member of this network
8107821 frankly the university didnt do a lot to communicate this to students last year
8107822 i think its the drivers responsibility to know the state laws but if nobody says you cant drive on the sidewalks why would you stop driving on them
8107823 if they tell me i can park in a bike rack and the only way to get to it is the sidewalk im going to assume i can drive on the sidewalks
8107824 i know the universitys policy about tobacco but i dont care
8107825 at first it is almost overwhelming but you get used to it
8107826 hey weve got this much money that people have paid us and we dont have anything that needs it it means that we can take this money and give it back to them and not take it from them next year
8107827 the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures
8107828 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8107829 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
8107830 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder

8107840 he likes to run and hit and he plays real physical he has done a great job learning the scheme and he has a lot of natural instincts he really understands blocking schemes how to slip them and how to take them on the production in the scrimmages he was in was off the charts in how many tackles and assists he made
8107841 during the campaign we talked a lot about extending library hours just because it was something i was really really passionate about because i use the library a lot
8107842 i just thought extended hours would be something that would benefit every single student who utilizes the library and a lot of students do especially during finals
8107843 in the surveys students werent particularly interested in any bells and whistles all night cafes things like that
8107844 they just wanted a way to be able to continue their studying away from roommates and other distractions until they were completely finished
8107845 we have been trying to educate our students and fans about this
8107846 i think that will be an adjustment for more fans
8107847 the tobacco ban makes it even more imperative that we strictly adhere to sec policies
8107848 im willing to bet you people in south arkansas dont know about the ban
8107849 its been remarkably silent and it will be until that first football game
8107850 the ban is good in certain areas but i dont know about a complete campus ban

8107854 the event is a great place to meet university programs people and interact with other students
8107855 i always say there has to be a sick reason why you go through this rejection constantly if you ever ask whether or not you should be a comedian dont do it
8107856 you shouldnt have to ask you should need to do it if you dont need to do it save yourself a lot of pain and get a family and a real life
8107857 fatel has two cds out called super retardo and mini skirts and muffins
8107858 fatel has developed an endearing stage persona that makes his very funny and very raunchy material quite acceptable super retardo is hilarious stand up comedy and definitely a disc you keep around to listen to from time to time
8107859 fatel comes across as your nerdy raging hormoned nerdy little brother in his stage persona but definitely has a grown mans mind and sexual drive there is something so utterly charming and endearing about this stand up comic on stage that he can obviously hit on a female member of the audience ask her the most intimate questions and get an answer and cross what would for any other stand up comedian be the line and get away with it
8107860 i have so many different groups of people coming to the shows and everyone usually waits patiently in line after my performances and are just so incredibly cool and complimentary they really are the nicest people ive ever met
8107861 i dont mean to put down wrestling or the maury povich show or larry the cable guy but ive seen the fans of these particular entities and i think my fans are smarter and cooler
8107862 ua students should see fatels show because its the greatest comedy show of the semester thus far
8107863 the phi delta theta members and leadership were extremely helpful and cooperative in identifying the responsible individual

8107878 this revives the issue of the catholic divide between those who run afoul of church teachings and interpret them to fit a liberal view of human rights and social justice and those whose public actions are informed by church teachings on all matters of human rights and peace and justice
8107879 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
8107880 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8107881 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions or invite them to speak at our functions or schools
8107882 but now she says we got to throw our support behind obama and people get that
8107883 but just like any other political decision you get over it and go back with the party
8107884 hes got a lot to prove to me i f i had to base my vote on how his supporters have treated us id be voting for mccain

8107889 no we havent had any contact with ms hawach thats a given we dont expect contact or anything like that but the phone call my wife made to her to see how the girls were doing there was nothing there no she didnt ask to see how we fared
8107890 we always wanted that outcome for the girls to get back to their mum and they now have communication with their father as well by phone i have no regrets

8108241 but the way things have gone in somalia from what we know and from what weve seen in the past thats not necessarily a bad thing that theres been no demand yet
8108242 in the case of some italian aid workers kidnapped a while ago in somalia it took seven to 10 days before any contact was made so you see were still early on
8108243 somalia is a dangerous place there are a lot of various factions and many of them have guns its a confusing place

8108246 se entiende que el 99 de los problemas tienen que resolverse con di logo con palabras lo dice la ley claramente que el uso de la fuerza es excepcional es un instrumento que da cuenta de ense ar a los funcionarios a hacer su trabajo bien y de que uno pueda como ministerio auditarlos en su comportamiento en estas reas tan dif ciles neur lgicas

8108265 obama missed a great opportunity when he didnt pick hillary for vice president it could have united the party
8108266 now dont get me wrong ive been a democrat all my life
8108267 do you know anything about this lawsuit to prevent obama from becoming the nominee
8108268 the lawsuit was filed for a temporary restraining order but the judge denied it
8108269 its certainly on our radar screen but the mayor hasnt decided yet if he wants to weigh in on this
8108270 this is not being done in the best interests of the people of san diego
8108271 they should realize theres a new group of people coming in
8108272 by approving and awarding compensation to herself and others without authority to do so

8108289 people are saying the reason prices are falling are because of all of the foreclosures but the foreclosures are happening because the prices are falling
8108290 theyve got it backwards the prices are falling because theyre too freakin high
8108291 there seems to be no understanding of the toxic nature of this inventory
8108292 an inventory dominated by lender sellers a very motivated group of sellers means prices will be driven down hard private sellers with insufficient equity who have to sell in this environment will have no option but to apply for a short sale or be foreclosed upon
8108293 the fact that these numbers are coming in at the numbers they are thats exactly what im saying

8108581 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website

8108587 well who knows he may be announcing some new intergalactic agreement of some kind or other you never know whats going to come out
8108588 what i would like to see him do is focus on the real economic issues
8108589 hes got to tell the australian people why he wants to raise a raft of new inflationary taxes when the government already has a huge surplus when inflation is elevated and every one of these taxes will put upward pressure on inflation
8108590 the objective of good government is for government to raise no more money than it needs
8108591 i think its important from time to time that the prime minister take the opportunity at venues like the press club to outline and update our plans for the future
8108592 im not about to blow the lid on whats about to be said today but we have a clear agenda following on from the commitment we made at the last election
8108593 he says a lot but he doesnt actually say anything
8108594 there is a clear lack of strategic direction in the government
8108595 weve got a whole variety of stunts and things that are intended to manage a 24 hour news cycle but we dont have real decisions that affect australians as far as cost of living pressures real decisions that will improve the challenges with petrol and groceries
8108596 weve got no clear strategic economic direction for the rest of this term of government
8108597 what mr rudd is now trying to do is now having us believe that hes going to go to the press club to give us his direction for the country
8108598 its been a week since weve had a big announcement its about time for another big announcement the big announcement that goes nowhere
8108599 i would like to hear from the prime minister that theyre government having no more inquiries
8108600 i want action from him i want him to act to repair this situation
8108601 hes said he is going to do something about jobs hes destroying jobs
8108602 international human rights treaties and the protection of prisoners rights

8108608 the solution is not to force the artist to alter her work but instead to use the occasion of that work as an entry point for meaningful debate and discussion

8108617 he just looks like an animal he just looks like an animal
8108618 he was very respectful the whole way back didnt have any trouble
8108619 it was very horrific the way that he raped her as we believe the evidence would show the suspect did this
8108620 it feels good to bring the family closure and thats what were here to do

8108642 wahai rasulullah aku bermaksud membangunkan orang yang terlelap dan mengusir syetan
8108643 ya allah betapa kumuhnya hatiku milik mu itu selama ini telah kuaku aku sebagai milikku sungguh aku tak tahu diri kini dengan shalatku ini kukembalikan dia kepada mu ya allah terimalah pengembalianku ini dan sucikanlah kembali kalbuku
8108644 ya allah engkau mahatahu kau tahu isi hatiku kau tahu bidadari mana yang aku hasrati bila kau berkenan memasukkan aku ke taman surga mu memang akal sehatku senantiasa mengingatkan aku bahwa dia milik mu akan tetapi hati kecilku berbisik dia terlalu indah untuk kulepaskan haruskah aku lupakan dia manakah jalan yang happy ending bagi semuanya bagi engkau bagi kami bagi keluarga kami bagi masyarakat kami
8108645 ya allah kenikmatan insani yang pernah kau pinjamkan kepadaku melalui kedekatan kami berdua selalu membayangi hari hariku dan malam malamku tawanya yang renyah budi pekertinya yang santun olah katanya yang menawan suaranya yang merdu senyumnya yang aduhai parasnya yang cemerlang cintanya yang begitu tulus kepadaku semuanya begitu indah bukan ya tuhan sungguh aku penasaran
8108646 jika aku bersabar menerima taqdir dan menyambut hari akhir maka tentu allah akan jadikan dia bidadariku kelak di surga untuk selama lamanya
8108647 ya allah seandainya mengingat ingat si dia menjauhkan aku dari kebaikan lenyapkanlah dari benakku segala kenangan tentang dia betapapun manisnya namun seandainya mengingat ingat si dia mendekatkan aku dengan kebaikan peliharalah di benakku segala kenangan tentang dia betapapun pahitnya

8108656 i said at the beginning this was an historic occasion and i saw christel out of the corner of my eye thinking i was going to talk about her birthday
8108657 but this was the first time wed had a three woman panel of the court of appeals in kansas and we looked out and saw 13 men waiting to argue how often does that happen
8108658 that we have a three woman panel on the court of appeals but it took too long to happen
8108659 when we get together we can talk about things we wouldnt ever do in front of the guys
8108660 im sure you all remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home

8108677 ive visited north korea in 1999 2004 2005 and then the last time in october 2007 so i can see the dynamic of this change
8108678 in 1999 even in pyongyang people were exhausted malnourished feeble in 2004 the situation was very different the whole city looked like one big market
8108679 there was activity everywhere on streets under the bridges from the windows of apartments
8108680 there have been a lot of changes but they are very patchy its still not a transitional economy
8108681 certain segments or layers are allowed to adopt some market driven mechanisms but the majority of the economy is being artificially preserved
8108682 its the level of specificity in the ideology thats the problem for reform
8108683 if your guiding principles were vague and adaptable it would be easier but in north korea they have official guidelines on how to do proper ostrich farming how can you now say in fact thats not the right way to do ostrich farming
8108684 north koreans were taught their whole lives that the state would provide now they have to take care of themselves
8108685 a mistake of just one word can lead a north korean to be publicly executed in this society
8108686 it is impossible to resist publicly the regime the control and suppression are beyond our imagination slaughter is still being carried out in north korea
8108687 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalised the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units

8108697 bayangkan saja dengan nilai dollar yang jauh di atas rupiah akan sangat mudah terjadi arus barang keluar tetapi yang mendapat untung justru orang luar sementara pedagang dan petani kita hanya mendapat sedikit yang tidak sebanding dengan harga pasar di luar sana
8108698 bukan itu saja produksi produksi pertanian belum juga distandarkan sehingga kita hanya mampu menjual barang mentah saja saya pikir kita mesti cepat memberi pemahaman kepada usaha kecil menengah yang akan segera terbuka pasar mereka dengan ada mia ini mereka dibina agar barang diproduksi dengan standar internasional tidak asal jadi sementara itu soal packing penting sekali ini salah satu faktor penentu bagaimana sebuah barang bisa masuk ke pasar internasional
8108699 belum ada kelihatan bagaimana nantinya tingkat kunjungan dan investasi yang bakal datang atau perkiraan barang dan jasa yang bakal lahir dari sini lalu menelaah persoalan dan jalan keluarnya belum ada sama sekali
8108700 cuma yang menikmatinya siapa jangan jangan pengusaha lokal pengusaha kecil juga kalah lagi akibat regulasi yang tidak jelas inilah sebenarnya pentingnya pemerintah memikiran portal atau aturan baku untuk masyarakat ingat pasar internasional tidak bisa intervensi kecuali masyarakat kita diajak berpikir maju
8108701 jika produksinya terbatas packing tidak standar kualitas masih di bawah maka barang lain yang dibawa dari luar yang justru lebih laku di sini belum lagi kebutuhan pasokan sayur hasil pertanian dan hasil perkebunan yang jika saja disepelekan kita tidak akan dilirik sebagai sentra produksi besar akibatnya adalah mia tidak menjadi sesuatu yang bersentuhan kepada masyarakat
8108702 in a lot of cases these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which theyre helping to diffuse that situation

8108706 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
8108707 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
8108708 it seems to me everyone in the world should be obsessed with this

8108756 his words were there would be no money for any person who opposed the sale
8108757 i rang the treasurer and he flatly denies it absolutely not true
8108758 it was a question asked of him at a branch meeting about the proceeds and the treasurer made the point that if the electricity reform doesnt proceed there is no other additional infrastructure package for anyone
8108759 most city retreats of this nature are held in town to save on costs and to make it easier for interested citizens to attend so why on earth would washougal pick a location that accomplishes neither of those goals
8108760 when trying to keep costs down and public participation up why would washougal choose sunriver for their retreat location we hope to hear more details soon from mayor sellers on that point
8108761 there seems to have been some disconnect between mike and reporter dawn feldhaus nabiel the washougal city administrator made it clear yesterday that a location had not been determined i brought up the lack of a retreat location last night at workshop and reiterated that to dawn feldhaus today by stating sun river was being considered but due to cost and transparency this will not work for me we will be looking for somewhere local but a place has not been determined also mike asked for more details yet never asked any questions to begin with he could have easily sent me an e mail called me or our staff for details

8108767 we originally were approached in late november and early december and we decided to take the job because the father had actually taken the kids to a war zone
8108768 there was a kitty we used for expenses there were five to six team members but in the end i came home with a six figure debt
8108769 no we havent had any contact with ms hawach thats a given we dont expect contact or anything like that but the phone call my wife made to her to see how the girls were doing there was nothing there no she didnt ask to see how we fared
8108770 we always wanted that outcome for the girls to get back to their mum and they now have communication with their father as well by phone i have no regrets
8108771 we knew what we were doing originally the plan i had in place was to wait for a legal outcome but that went south it didnt work so we decided to stay back and go with a plan that was a lot riskier
8108772 there was not a whole lot said she put them directly in a vehicle drove out changed vehicles she talked to the girls in the back and they dropped them off to beirut
8108773 i would imagine it would be very hard for anyone subject to these sort of things to come forward

8108776 theres no loose ends being let go at this stage
8108777 i can confirm that theres no one at the school at the moment that is subject to that inquiry
8108778 at this stage were looking at 13 victims and were following up those lines of inquiry at the moment
8108779 there were three former staff member who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8108780 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8108781 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8108782 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8108783 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8108784 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can

8108845 the only difference between us and 1984 is we dress better

8108847 a cooking lesson that focused on a set of very doable recipes with a whole lot of tips history and science thrown into the mix
8108848 i dont believe in scrimping by not eating something and then going overboard by eating a box of snackwells
8108849 use what you can and throw the rest of it away
8108850 dont even use the phyllo just take the shortbread top it with ganache and raspberries and garnish with ice cream
8108851 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8108852 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8108853 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8108854 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8108855 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8108856 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8108857 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8108858 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8108859 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8108860 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8108861 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8108862 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8108863 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8108864 all you need is 200 people in the crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8108865 we all have a right to free speech in the united states
8108866 its important for her to see democracy in action free speech law and order
8108867 we came downtown to expose her to marchers and people trying to get their message to the delegates and the theyre trying to shape the country and mold the future
8108868 this is operation first casualty because the first casualty of war is the truth
8108869 we want to show how oppressive it can be for the iraq people and the soldiers as well
8108870 were going to be on him obama until all of our brothers and sisters are home
8108871 we named our collector helios 1 after the greek sun god helios
8108872 we heard about the incredible number of days of sunshine in colorado and started looking at places here to move our business
8108873 we wanted people to look at pueblo in a different light not as the stepchild of colorado springs pueblo is a nice little town
8108874 its a monster that can roast large batches of coffee in about 15 to 25 minutes i can roast 30 pounds of coffee beans
8108875 the helios 4 the fourth generation of the solar roaster is a hybrid roaster
8108876 electricity is collected in six photovoltaic solar panels when the weather is not sunny the roaster is helped with a small propane heat source
8108877 i believe that the process of using the sun to roast the coffee is not as harsh as regular big burners
8108878 mike has a lot of experience in coffee roasting and doesnt over roast it
8108879 if the celebrity issue were not hurting them they would have ignored it
8108880 this is a typically superfluous response from barack obama like most celebrities he reacts to fair criticism with a mix of fussiness and hysteria
8108881 would really have no impact on gas prices for i dont know a generation
8108882 thats brilliant politics it just has no basis in reality
8108883 obama agrees to roll call vote for clinton does that make him a sissy
8108884 as if people were watching television with the sound turned down
8108885 oops you thought i was going to kiss you and well im not

8108888 you do really good for you you are a good good person tell your parents to do the same it is very important for you guys
8108889 in a mood to come to us if they shall be compelled to give up their first love
8108890 the audience like a wild colt with a bit between his teeth rose above all cry of order and again and again the irrepressible applause broke forth and resounded far and wide
8108891 no comanches no panthers ever struck a higher note or gave screams with more infernal intensity
8108892 shouldering the symbolic fence rails that lincoln had supposedly split republicans paraded through the streets to the music of a dozen bands
8108893 we try to keep envy happy normally envy is very grumpy
8108894 that noblest of men answered him the leader of the warrior band unlocked his wordhoard
8108895 what about the instrumental and dative can be used to show possessive too and what about

8108901 in the likelihood sanchez cant go both our quarterbacks are ready to go
8108902 they both had what it feels to run this team the main concern is their confidence in handling the system it takes a long time it took mark three years it took john david booty three years matt leinart did it a little quicker
8108903 we all thought he was in big trouble but he just wouldnt hear any of it
8108904 were down to six running backs somehow well find away theyve got style theyve got speed theyve got flexiility c j gable is probably best equipped for all three phases blocking catching and running
8108905 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8108906 well then youre a bit of alright then arent you
8108907 you know ive been looking for a bird to bang the ass of off ever since my beloved heather died
8108908 hes anxious to get back to britney but mills wont let him have any peace
8108909 he expected me to go away quietly he offered me only 40 million to shut up ive never been so humiliated in my life and ive worked as a glamour model
8108910 yeah mills weve all seen the uses that you can put whipped cream too
8108911 never you mind you bastards theres one woman wholl understand me
8108912 we have checked and there is no record of a lady mccartney
8108913 first the bardot woman and now this english lunatic since my cd release they are really coming out of the wood work how you say oh la la
8108914 i am so sorry ms mills for not recognizing you when you called earlier but you introduced yourself as lady mccartney our advisers tell me that once you divorce you loose the title of lady mccartney and so there was no record of you
8108915 paul was really broken up about it you know hes lost without me
8108916 heather blurts as bruni winces i cant believe that she said that
8108917 and i think that you can help me do so much for women like us
8108918 now bruni seems mildly interested a little curious but far from sold
8108919 and not just for women oh no but also for the rain forest vegetarianism and little baby seals
8108920 eine der zuverl ssigsten warez seiten berhaupt seit jahren online 42 meist wichtige appz die zu 99 online sind
8108921 tell me about this initiative that you started what do you mean what initiative you dont have an initiative aw man thats a problem you should really have an initiative
8108922 going down into the sea with flames on one of the wings
8108923 it has been a record year for us we dont normally have a national disaster like in other parts of the country
8108924 red cross national is taking out loans we would probably take out loans or float our bills
8108925 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8108926 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our candidate
8108927 i think thats also very important to the local economy
8108928 mcclendons kind of like the van andels of grand rapids or the princes of holland
8108929 he has the resources and the motivation to help us do these things that we cant do locally
8108930 damit beenden wir die trickserei derjenigen hersteller die die pfandpflicht ber eine modifizierte rezeptur also etwa durch die verwendung von s stoff statt zucker jahrelang umgangen haben
8108931 ordnungspolitisch sinnvoll ist das nicht wenn man schon l cken schlie t dann sollten auch konsequent alle ausnahmen beseitigt werden
8108932 beim bier haben wir die gew nschte lenkungswirkung erreicht bei mineralwasser und erfrischungsgetr nken nicht
8108933 your class is 1 hour and 15 minutes and that means ive scheduled all these others wrong because theyre only an hour apart
8108934 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8108935 it is time to take back the country we love
8108936 and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8108937 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8108938 were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8108939 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8108940 republicans generally hate homosexuals so much so that we have a shortage of arabic translators because many were fired due to their their sexual orientation
8108941 there has been much talk recently about whether states should give gay and lesbian couples the legal right to marry which of the following comes closest to your position on this issue do you support full marriage rights for same sex couples or support civil unions or partnerships for same sex couples but not full marriage rights or do you oppose any legal recognition for same sex couples
8108942 im going to vote democratic because that gay person over there did and im gay too
8108943 bernice king the youngest daughter of the king family is a minister in her own right and despite her own mother and the wife of martin luther king jr
8108944 if the people through their legislatures voted that into law i would respect that
8108945 also proof of the shortage of arabic translators due to the fact they are gay ive seen you write a lot of stupid things boris but this one takes the cake
8108946 its not that the gay guy gave the money its that grampa mccain accepted it
8108947 but the gao also noted that nearly 800 dismissed gay or lesbian service members had critical abilities including 300 with important language skills fifty five were proficient in arabic including copas a graduate of the defense language institute in california
8108948 one of the republican partys shortcomings is also one of its philosophical strengths
8108949 really you dont think the repuvlican party hasnt related to evangelical christians in the recent past and promised to give them things
8108950 gays cant vote republican because republicans dont support gay marriage
8108951 first of all a cbs news story provided by boring boris relating to 6 translators and making a judgement that basically all arabs are gay is simply absurd cbs is actually see b s
8108952 but the most vocal anti family activists are evangelical republicans who try to use state constitutions to prohibit marriage and to allow discrimination
8108953 but when it comes to glbt rights the democrats have their backs on an official level much better than republicans do
8108954 we can rearrange the deck chairs after we do something about the hole in the side of the ship
8108955 obama 08 people belong to groups groups advocate for positions and candidates understood to be in the interests of the membership and the members of a group can cat their vote any way they wish
8108956 if you want to be perfect go sell your possessions and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven
8108957 we would like to see a breakthrough in the negotiations with the palestinians before the end of 2008 but i tell you that i dont see a peace agreement emerging within the next few months
8108958 those of us who claim to follow christs teaching should be ashamed entire nations are going up in flames while we watch them burn
8108959 we cant reach far enough to offer compassion because our arms are too busy holding all that we own
8108960 what will our generation be remembered for youtube wouldnt it be better if we could be known for defeating poverty
8108961 but will not the perspective that the church is always public lead straight to fideism epistemology and sectarianism sociology
8108962 in the first three months spending is up two and a half times what these so called fiscally responsible conservatives in ottawa budgeted it to be
8108963 it will simply not be credible for the conservatives to characterize themselves as being responsible with the public purse
8108964 it remains to be seen if the opposition liberals can take advantage of the governments reckless spending record in an election campaign
8108965 i find that hard to believe but im not discounting anything ill wait for my investigators to provide some preliminary findings to me
8108966 i do want to know immediately if there is a security concern regarding infrastructure
8108967 inmates are pretty ingenious and they do have a lot of time on their hands i understand that we have to look at every possible scenario
8108968 staff will be very critical in this to provide us with some feedback into what happened that night
8108969 well the wierd thing about that is no video does plays from itunes
8108970 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8108971 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8108972 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8108973 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8108974 mutating trans atlantic melting pot of styles tastes and behavior s
8108975 the hipster represents the end of western civilization a culture so detached and disconnected that it has stopped giving birth to anything new
8108976 is this really going to be different or is it just another cool thing to do which also seems radical
8108977 i dont know who i am or what im really doing
8108978 well no not quite i figure if all that talk in the new testament and our christmas hymns about jesus is king of kings and lord of lords and joy to the world the lord has come let earth receive her king is true then those are massively political claims far bigger than cute figures of speech to sooth the sin sacked soul so yeah if i believe that then that has big implications for my politics
8108979 good news ing should be sharp and clear and reasonably quick
8108980 not bogged down with all this gobbldigoop about some far flung public private dualism dualism shmuialism brandon
8108981 oh you can explain all that revolution hoo ha once theyre in the fold and have jesus in their heart just give them a very basic pitch for now the political offense of the gospel can come later
8108982 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8108983 proud supporter of barack obama she dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8108984 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8108985 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8108986 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8108987 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8108988 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8108989 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8108990 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8108991 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8108992 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8108993 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8108994 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheque stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8108995 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8108996 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8108997 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8108998 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8108999 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8109000 i want to be a silver maker when i grow up
8109001 its a team that can get you at any point so youve got to kind of be on your toes
8109002 you can never get too comfortable youve got to go out and still be aggressive you cant change your game plan too much but i think theres a point with teams like this that theyre never out of it its a tough team to pitch again
8109003 i honestly dont know how we beat him three times
8109004 hes probably the best pitcher in baseball tonight he had a good night
8109005 when doc is on the mound youve just got to scratch out a few runs and youve got a chance to win
8109006 hes one of the premier pitchers in the league i thought i pitched pretty well tonight but when youre facing halladay youve got to be in your a game
8109007 it definitely wasnt my a game or else i would have won the game
8109008 you cant make too many errors when youre facing a guy like that
8109009 in my view if don bradman were playing today he would still have an average twice as good as any other batsman in the world
8109010 with the advances in bat technology and training imagine how good the don would be today it would be scary
8109011 he is by far the best batsman ever and would still be in todays game
8109012 his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach in his time or any player who has played since its almost like he played a different game to what were playing
8109013 during my trip to play for the world eleven against australia in 1972 73 don bradman came specially to meet me at adelaide airport
8109014 i consider it the happiest moment and great honour of my life i have preserved this picture and shall cherish it throughout my life
8109015 ing samubarang gawe aja sok wani mesthekake awit akeh lelakon kang akeh banget sambekalane sing ora bisa dinuga tumibane
8109016 menawa manungsa iku pancen wajib ihtiyar nanging pepesthene dumunung ing astane pangeran kang maha wikan
8109017 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
8109018 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8109019 theyre being perceived as the evil empire theyre going to have to do some serious things to change it
8109020 i dont think today we have taken a step backwards in our preparations
8109021 perhaps we werent so precise but we had an opponent which was also playing and we had five or six chances with only the goalkeeper to beat
8109022 we lost but we could have drawn or even won
8109023 dan a da solid o n o dela filha do paulinho da viola e preciso me encontrar do candeia ou do cartola ela boa e regravou muito samba bom sabe aquela n o suporto mais tua aus ncia j pedi a deus paci ncia aquilo ainda mais antigo se n o me engano portela com jamel o
8109024 that the sinker is up in the zone a little bit and we can make him work a little bit and we can get the ball up off him and see if hes off and do some damage and score some runs
8109025 yeah its very important with sinker ballers you dont want them to get in a groove and get a great feel of their sinkers
8109026 the church must be free to be poor in order to minister among the poor the church must trust the gospel enough to come among the poor with nothing to offer the poor except the gospel except the power to discern and the courage to expose the gospel as it is already mediated in the life of the poor when the church has the freedom itsdeelf to be poor among the poor it will know how to use what riches it has when the church has that freedom it will know also how to minister among the rich and powerful when the church has that freedom it will be a missionary people again in all the world when the church has the freedom to go out into the world with merely the gospel to offer the world then it will know how to use whatever else it has money and talent and buildings and tapestries and power in politics as sacraments of its gift of its own life to the world as tokens of the ministry of christ
8109027 the kingdom of this world has already in greek become the kingdom of our god and of his christ and he will reign forever and forever
8109028 imagine a world set aright and stubbornly live that out
8109029 if mans heart is not good then nothing else can turn out good either and the goodness of the human heart can ultimately come only from the one who is goodness
8109030 the average north american person is confronted every day by somewhere between five and twelve thousand corporate messages all geared to shaping a consumer imagination the messages are all telling the same story a finite world can sustain infinite growth economic growth is the driving force of history consumer choice is what makes us human and greed is normal if we live in an empire it is the empire of global consumerism
8109031 before we can see the kingdom reality we must first repent of the old order before we can experience the joy of the kingdom we must mourn over the empire and one can never mourn if they seek to save themselves from judgment instead we must own our complicity
8109032 head for the hills when you see all this happening
8109033 i try to live like an indian as you see it is stupid of course because in our country it is the british who decide how an indian lives what he may buy what he may sell and from their luxury in the midst of our terrible poverty they instruct us on what is justice and what is sedition he looks at them a teasing but mordant grin so it is only natural that our best young minds assume an air of eastern dignity while greedily assimilating every western weakness as quickly as they can acquire it
8109034 rick you are not here to criticize or to judge you are here to wash feet
8109035 though were strangers still i love you i love you more than your mask
8109036 in a discussion of abortion itself obama wrote that government has more important business than
8109037 well i was 29 years old when i came to the us senate
8109038 joe biden has represented the state of delaware in the united states senate since 1972 when he was elected at the age of twenty nine
8109039 no person shall be a senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years
8109040 if you truly believe a pandemic outbreak is likely there is reason to believe foreign governments and the u s will clamp down and control the supply
8109041 other places in the world may have a lot of money but no amount of money will get you vaccines in the case of a pandemic
8109042 we see no reason to invest additional money of our own into the pandemic vaccine when we can wait for a foreign government that needs this vaccine to put money in
8109043 there are half a dozen economic issues today each one of which is as important as the most important issue at the beginning of most presidential terms
8109044 the artist uses wood plaster paper bark moss and selected grass planted for hay

8109054 i just want to get as deep in the game as i can
8109055 give the team a chance to win and put up as many zeros as i can
8109056 the way he takes the mound sets the tone for the game
8109057 playing defense behind him when hes pounding the strike zone like that it keeps you on your toes
8109058 i felt good for the first two innings and then i just got away from my game plan
8109059 i tried to battle through it but it just didnt work out a bounce here and a bounce there and that was it
8109060 we just didnt make plays that we should have we just couldnt stop the bleeding
8109061 just hopefully well continue to win the way we are as a team and finish strong
8109062 i dont like it i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please

8109067 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8109068 i want to be able to forgive barack obama but what happened to hillary bugs me
8109069 just remember this over the last eight years youve been falling behind
8109070 over the last eight years your lives are less secure
8109071 it is a very serious federal crime to threaten a presidential candidate in this case however there is insufficient evidence at this time to indicate a true threat plot or conspiracy against senator obama
8109072 encourage our young people to become active in politics when the national broadcaster refers to the taoiseach as biffo
8109073 as much to do with a boys comic character from the 1950s as it has to do with any reference to people from county offaly
8109074 indeed the term has been used by mr cowen himself in a humourous context
8109075 which tells me nothing really but anyway thats their response
8109076 mr kenny used the expression so called reputable insurance company as a not unreasonable reaction to the possibility that an insurance company can withdraw cover

8109085 if gustav is able to thread the needle passing through the yucatan channel into the gulf of mexico it could intensify to category 4 or 5 strength over the warm water in the gulf
8109086 if it makes it to the gulf gustav could be the first major hurricane category 3 or greater in the gulf since hurricane wilma reached category 3 strength as it steered from the yucatan peninsula to south florida in october 2005
8109087 at this moment in time the computer models show gustav as being a pretty strong threat to the gulf of mexico by early next week
8109088 producers have been working to strengthen their platforms to protect them from storm damage
8109089 the potential for gustav to become a major hurricane over the next four days depends primarily on two factors how close it tracks to cuba and the interaction it has with the island
8109090 the longer gustav stays over the warm water in the caribbean the stronger it gets and the greater the chance that it will become a category 3 hurricane by saturday
8109091 they should take a low profile their movements should be restricted during this period

8109101 if you dont like the idea of the parade dont go to it
8109102 i do have a problem with promoting pornography and sexual violence all of which this seems to promote
8109103 the most unpleasant thing is that the women involved are being used by someone to get advertising
8109104 but they needed some coaxing to get in the sitski even when they were on the mountain
8109105 there was so much action happening at all times up there

8109109 drivers are continually facing incidents where the public are cutting through fences from one side to the other at undesirable places on the rail corridor to save time
8109110 sometimes our trains run late or they could be authorised to run in the opposite direction
8109111 when driving the units my job is to concentrate on signals answer radio calls knowing the positions of stop boards at work sites sometimes this all happens simultaneously
8109112 if a pedestrian is caught in front of a train the consequences are almost always serious or fatal which isnt something any of us want
8109113 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
8109114 a movie is a one off 90 minutes a year so yes as long as it never gets in the way of the show it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic

8109126 the targets are those clubs that are part of a larger criminal operation where medical marijuana winds up being sold on the street and contributing to crime and violence
8109127 its something many activists have been looking for since the medical marijuana law passed
8109128 we only sell to patients we only get our pot in small quantities from patients who grow it and sell it on consignment
8109129 weve been on the front page of every major newspaper in the nation and have never been bothered by the feds because we are an open book

8109150 pharmaceutical firms will only fund speakers who give favorable messages on the products theyre trying to sell

8109157 we know that president obama will bring our troops home from iraq responsibly and begin to rebuild and he will have a terrific partner in michelle obama she will make a great first lady and americans are fortunate that joe biden will be at obamas side as vice president hes pragmatic hes wise and hes tough they will be a great team for america

8109290 one group donated more than 100 000 toothbrushes for distribution to the tornado victims
8109291 while everyone certainly needs toothbrushes and appreciates this persons efforts since there are only about 1 400 people in that town there are going to be a lot left over

8109300 after spending so much money on it people hate to throw it away and instead want to give it to a good cause
8109301 we keep the leotard on hand to help demonstrate to our volunteers what we cant accept
8109302 she was also nice enough to note on the lids of the puzzle boxes exactly how many pieces were missing from each and they were all missing several
8109303 its strange what people consider worth hanging on to and then worse yet worth donating to someone else
8109304 someone brought in a set of ceramic farm animals roosters and such and they were very odd looking
8109305 most of the time people put themselves in the victims shoes and want to donate something anything to help them
8109306 im in the process now of working with a man who drove quite a long distance to give us 500 pair of new florsheims
8109307 i just want my fans to know i was at my worst he was at his best and i still beat him
8109308 i was being sarcastic because i really could not believe that it went the way it did
8109309 im not a sore loser shit happens but i was hoping that forrest would be a man and come out and say you know what i didnt win that fight especially after he watched it
8109310 if he was doing drugs if he had been drunk if he had gone out there and done what he did because he was pissed off at someone that would be a completely different story
8109311 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it

8109320 at two more degrees of warming most global warming models predict that our climate system will start creating its own warming feedback at such a rate that we wont be able to stop global warming without some major league scientific brilliance we will most likely not manage the major league scientific brilliance and in any case who the hell wants to rely on a hail mary pass for the future of the human race

8109350 texas thinks the private sector will pick up the problem but as we see this is not the case
8109351 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8109352 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8109353 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8109354 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8109355 we believe the most powerful influence that drives communal politics is not race but the perception of racial economic inequality
8109356 therefore any insensitive reforms to merely decentralise political communal representation will not lead to unity but could instead be a cause of future contention
8109357 hillary can tell us to do whatever to support obama and unify but its not going to happen
8109358 when we leave here im afraid there will be a false sense that we have the unity to all march in line thats not going to happen
8109359 this is not an enviable position to be in for obama
8109360 cant live without the clintons but living with them is not a walk in the park either but they have their supporters who are both intense and wounded
8109361 these are the people in the end who will either decide that obama is fit to be the president or not
8109362 barack has said all the right things he needs to say them more often

8109365 but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president

8109384 the lpga could lose some tremendous players if its not careful
8109385 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8109386 thats why i dont think this is an overall bad thing
8109387 and i think it also can really help the players become more comfortable in the environment they play
8109388 were more of an international tour now but were an american based tour and the players need the tools to interact with fans and sponsors one of those tools is to speak english

8109424 as a result historical data relating to credit card applications from some of our customers and data from other banks were not removed we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
8109425 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was not planned to be disposed of by the company and investigations are still ongoing to find out how this equipment was removed from one of graphic datas secure locations
8109426 we take customer privacy and data security very seriously this incident is extremely regrettable and were taking every possible step to retrieve the data and ensure this is an isolated incident
8109427 it is essential that companies have appropriate procedures in place to ensure that personal records are kept secure at all times the ico said in a statement
8109428 if companies are disposing of computer equipment they must take the necessary steps to ensure that any personal information stored on the hard drive is rendered unrecoverable we are now investigating this potential data breach and will be seeking an urgent explanation from graphic data to establish what has gone wrong and the steps that are being taken to prevent a similar incident occurring
8109429 my goal is to provide an alternative not to free the mac os

8109440 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8109441 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8109442 we dont support putting the lives of sudanese civilians at risk in any circumstances
8109443 the hijackers refuse to free any passengers or even open the doors which have remained closed since the plane landed
8109444 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala

8109461 to summarise our judgement even though reading the appeal record we find evidence to confirm that the appellants were involved in homosexual activities and we are more inclined to believe that the alleged incident at tivoli villa did happen
8109462 were still seeing record patients up there that are increasing at many times population growth
8109463 what were also seeing at this time of year during winter is pressure coming from the number of elderly people that are falling sick and requiring treatment
8109464 what im sick to death of is the local mps simply apologising for what is the essence of their governments mistakes
8109465 they should be down here in brisbane screaming in parliament about what the governments not doing in helping their people in townsville in north queensland deal with the crisis their facing

8109479 there is a special relationship between the arunta alice springs and the arrernte indigenous nation for whom the ship is named and its wonderful to see sailors and officers spending a week developing a closer connection with their home port
8109480 aruntas visit to central australia will include a tour of local sacred sites and the santa teresa mission hosted by the lhere artepe aboriginal corporation concluding with participation in the annual henley on todd
8109481 this morning personnel presented a cheque to the ships chosen charity anglicare
8109482 i am sure the people of alice springs will make the arunta crew welcome and their visit is testament to the high regard arunta has for their adopted home port
8109483 the eastern portion of the fault has moved at a predictable rate and the earthquake activity associated with it has been what we would expect
8109484 but the western part of the fault has been lagging in terms of the number and size of earthquakes it seems to be straining absorbing the motion
8109485 it could mean that the fault is getting ready for a large earthquake or it could mean that the movement has been so gradual that we couldnt detect it
8109486 land stations also detected a four fold increase in the number of earthquakes along the blanco fault in 2008 compared to background rates
8109487 our monitoring may be missing a lot of earthquakes that are less than 3 0
8109488 the western side of the fault may be experiencing a series of mini quakes that we cant detect or it could be slowing creeping along in a way we cannot measure
8109489 but we cant discount the possibility that its energy hasnt been released and it will some day in the form of a good sized earthquake
8109490 you need quite a bit of vertical displacement on the ocean floor to generate a tsunami
8109491 between the land based network the hydrophones and other instruments the threshold of detection for earthquakes has definitely lowered over the past 20 years
8109492 but we still cant tell whether the western part of the fault has thousands or even millions of infinitesimal slips or it is building up to a major earthquake
8109493 i know what we have out there i cannot dive without seeing abandoned gear its everywhere
8109494 its like a jungle of fishing line around those piers
8109495 abandoned nets drown marine mammals hundreds of coastal birds suffer injury when they become entangled in fishing line or when they ingest hooks
8109496 marine mammals including the federally threatened southern sea otter are injured or killed with wounds from entanglement or with obstructed or perforated intestines from swallowed hooks and line
8109497 boaters catch ropes attached to lost traps and pots or discarded monofilament line around their propellers surfers are injured running into lost gear underwater that reefs up in breaking waves as well lost gear clutters legal fishing grounds affecting fishermens ability to safely and efficiently deploy their own gear and in some cases damaging their nets
8109498 we have detected an insidious foreign hand in the parallel market for foreign currency
8109499 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8109500 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8109501 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8109502 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8109503 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8109504 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8109505 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8109506 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8109507 noaa is looking forward to taking a significant step in our efforts to protect right whales
8109508 our scientific analysis shows that a 10 knot speed limit in critical areas will significantly reduce the threat to these endangered marine mammals
8109509 the measures outlined in the preferred alternative represent a weakening of the regulations proposed by the bush administration
8109510 of primary concern is the governments plan to have final regulations go away after five years unless additional rulemaking is completed this sunset provision would come at a time when shipping traffic is expected to dramatically increase on the east coast
8109511 large commercial ships are not a primary cause of unnatural mortality of atlantic right whales
8109512 only those parts of the proposed regulation where the scientific justification is lacking
8109513 the industrys objection is that there is no scientific basis in the record of this rulemaking for imposing a 10 knot speed restriction within 30 nautical miles nm of east coast ports in the entire mid atlantic range from new york to savannah georgia this is the coastal range where the science is the weakest and the economic impact is the greatest
8109514 the bottom line is that this critically endangered species needs our help
8109515 the preferred alternative is a balanced approach grounded in science that would significantly enhance our ability to protect right whales but it would also take into account concerns about the safety of ship crews and the impact on an important segment of our economy
8109516 the environmental impact statement provides a preview of the measures that will be in the final regulations for the shipping industry to follow but it does not tell us when the final regulations will actually be published
8109517 until the final rule is published there continues to be no protections in place for right whales
8109518 while the bush administration has stalled the rule for well over a year at least two endangered north atlantic right whales have been struck by ships
8109519 yet still today we continue to wait for final regulations to protect an endangered species from its greatest threat

8109522 weve found sharks inside highly protected areas like the cod hole dead on the bottom with their tails cut off so the fishermen have just got upset with the animals pulled them up and killed them
8109523 hes in pretty good shape hes being detained as a matter of course as under honduran law he was associated with the woman who died
8109524 hes being held for questioning because the hondurans want to ascertain exactly what happened that night
8109525 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
8109526 i dont think you could measure this by other non lethal means
8109527 lots of dead bodies will provide robust data so if you kill lots of whales then you will get some information the question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed scientific whaling is not about science and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it

8109529 said jill stanek a nurse in the chicago area who writes an anti abortion blog
8109530 jill stanek an illinois nurse and anti abortion activist wrote on her web site
8109531 system codedom compiler codedomprovider createcompiler is obsolete callers should not use the icodecompiler interface and should instead use the methods directly on the codedomprovider class
8109532 there are 18 million cracks in that highest and hardest glass ceiling
8109533 i just want you to know that it really is okay if rigel stays in my class
8109534 you are not going to lay the blame for this on me
8109535 with so many other opportunities closed to young black kids if somebody makes you look bad with a shake and bake move then youve got to come right back at him with something better something more stylish its all about honor pride and establishing yourself as a man
8109536 the black game by itself is too chaotic and much too selfish white culture places more of a premium on winning and less on self indulgent preening and chest beating
8109537 in basketball and in civilian life freedom without structure winds up being chaotic and destructive
8109538 with failure the dark necessity of circumstance and personality stand out and the chain of events leading to despair death and perdition can be traced back to the first false step but success is too mercurial too volatile to be disciplined by causality it seems to possess no roots no history it merely exists blooms and dies
8109539 it was good for him to be back but he was out there only a short time so i doubt i can play him in the game
8109540 sowas hab ich jeanluc fr her auch mal geschrieben so ein

8109542 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8109543 i just took it as a strained reference something that she felt that she had to put it in
8109544 it was something like the i approve this message line in campaign ads something that has to be said
8109545 now concerning food offered to idols we know that all of us possess knowledge this knowledge puffs up but love builds up if anyone imagines that he knows something he does not yet know as he ought to know but if anyone loves god he is known by god
8109546 i was lobbying him because we want to make sure we get some people into kentucky to help our candidates
8109547 we want to make sure were at the top of their list
8109548 the other is the open seat in the 2nd congressional district
8109549 sen biden the vice presidential candidate has strong kentucky connections
8109550 hes traveled in kentucky campaigned here and helped our party raise money
8109551 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
8109552 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
8109553 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
8109554 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
8109555 i want a requirement that all fish caught in norwegian waters also by foreign vessels must be taken to port regardless of which final port is used we will introduce new requirements for instance as a condition for obtaining licenses to fish that vessels wishing to fish in norwegian waters cannot discard valuable fish caught here moreover in connection with the annual quota negotiations between the eu and norway this autumn we will demand further binding measures to reduce the discard of all joint stocks
8109556 over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8109557 we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8109558 the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8109559 what the speaker had to say about theologians and their positions regarding abortion was not only misinformed it was also and especially utterly incredible in this day and age
8109560 we are blessed in the 21st century with crystal clear photographs and action films of the living realities within their pregnant mothers
8109561 no one with the slightest measure of integrity or honor could fail to know what these marvelous beings manifestly clearly and obviously are as they smile and wave into the world outside the womb
8109562 in simplest terms they are human beings with an inalienable right to live a right that the speaker of the house of representatives is bound to defend at all costs for the most basic of ethical reasons
8109563 should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
8109564 her views on when life begins were informed by the views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8109565 it does not make sense to go back and defend things that were done centuries ago out of the wisdom of the people who lived then
8109566 grew out of the lack of the scientific data we have today that clearly shows an embryo is human
8109567 if you let an embryo come to term it will be a human not something else
8109568 its my role as a bishop to teach the faith
8109569 it is not the role of someone in public office
8109570 what struck me was this was an attempt to begin to interpret the catholic faith and to teach people and thats the role of bishops
8109571 regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them

8109598 went on to become a united states foreign service officer proudly representing america in places like turkey and india and pakistan where i was born
8109599 decades from now another young boy will go into a home in a remote village in a faraway part of the world and there hanging on the wall will be the portrait of another american president who again made america a beacon of hope in the world
8109600 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
8109601 every day in the gulf coast league youre liable to see something youve never seen before
8109602 our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion
8109603 i wouldnt mind if they would just take one and eat it but they just take one bite out of a peach and move on to the next
8109604 do you remember how the squirrels would steal corn from the garden and go up into the tree and eat it just looking at you
8109605 i just feel like were finding different ways to win ballgames
8109606 were kind of spoiled by now its been like that since april
8109607 i just want to get as deep in the game as i can
8109608 give the team a chance to win and put up as many zeros as i can
8109609 the way he takes the mound sets the tone for the game
8109610 playing defense behind him when hes pounding the strike zone like that it keeps you on your toes
8109611 i felt good for the first two innings and then i just got away from my game plan
8109612 i tried to battle through it but it just didnt work out a bounce here and a bounce there and that was it
8109613 we just didnt make plays that we should have we just couldnt stop the bleeding
8109614 just hopefully well continue to win the way we are as a team and finish strong
8109615 i dont like it i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please
8109616 its happened thousands of times thats part of the game
8109617 its a team that can get you at any point so youve got to kind of be on your toes
8109618 you can never get too comfortable youve got to go out and still be aggressive you cant change your game plan too much but i think theres a point with teams like this that theyre never out of it its a tough team to pitch again
8109619 i honestly dont know how we beat him three times
8109620 hes probably the best pitcher in baseball tonight he had a good night
8109621 when doc is on the mound youve just got to scratch out a few runs and youve got a chance to win
8109622 hes one of the premier pitchers in the league i thought i pitched pretty well tonight but when youre facing halladay youve got to be in your a game
8109623 it definitely wasnt my a game or else i would have won the game
8109624 you cant make too many errors when youre facing a guy like that
8109625 we understand that sometimes people need medical attention after their doctors office is closed leaving the emergency room as the only option even when its not an emergency
8109626 the new medwell should help when these situations arise by offering another option
8109627 the remediation project is still ongoing from an oil spill years ago on the davidson property a gas station
8109628 so i thought you might let your readers know speed cameras seem to be popping up all over the city i got a ticket from one on park place somewhere between princeton and irving by the old soldiers home usually there is a sign but i either missed it or there isnt one im starting to suspect there are more in places i am not aware yet updated so i just drove down park place and cant find that camera im wondering if it was a temporary thing or what but i definitely got a speeding ticket there from a camera maybe your readers know what is up

8109643 these findings are important as the data suggest treatment with angiomax provides similar protection against ischemia and death over standard therapy at 1 year furthermore at 30 days we saw angiomax reduced major bleeding multiple studies have shown a significant association between bleeding complications in acs and pci with mortality
8109644 the data from the acuity sub analysis suggest treatment with angiomax is an attractive antithrombotic therapeutic option for patients undergoing pci
8109645 these data at 1 year show that angiomax continues to demonstrate safety and efficacy for a full year following a patients angioplasty this is just the latest analysis from seven major randomized trials in nearly 25 000 patients consistently demonstrating angiomax offers improved outcomes for angioplasty patients compared to standard therapy
8109646 additionally angiomax may help reduce hospital costs particularly because of the reductions we have observed in major bleeding complications with approximately one million pci procedures performed in the u s per year incremental cost savings may result in substantial overall savings to the health care system
8109647 the presentation by professor thompson is expected to report data from the completed phase 1 clinical trial as well as providing an update on the current phase 2 study
8109648 professor thompson is one of the worlds foremost authorities on melanoma treatment and the global lead investigator for our pv 10 clinical trials
8109649 we announced recently that the first twenty five percent 20 of 80 of melanoma subjects have been treated in the phase 2 study with enrollment continuing at centers in brisbane and sydney australia and at the m d anderson cancer center in houston tx we expect to announce additional sites in australia and the u s in the coming months
8109650 we never considered that interferon alpha could be a major player in early type 1 diabetes
8109651 a normal process programmed cell death causes a normal response
8109652 but it does this in such a way that in a small subset of the population it starts them on the road to type 1 diabetes
8109653 the link between nonmelanoma skin cancer and increased risk for many different types of cancer may provide valuable clues to advance what we know about the causes of cancer
8109654 right now we do not understand why this link is present but it suggests that skin cancer may be a marker for a characteristic likely a genetic characteristic that increases overall susceptibility to cancer this certainly makes nmsc seem to be a more important part of ones personal health history than we previously thought
8109655 sf1126 could have additional impact in treating cancer where bv8 is an important component of angiogenesis
8109656 in addition to targeting angiogenesis sf1126 blocks key targets involved in tumor growth including mtor dna pk pim 1 and plk 1 this adds another layer of versatility to what sf1126 can do as an antitumor agent
8109657 its a dirty game and nobody is willing to clean it
8109658 i want to be able to honor the public trust
8109659 we want cme to be unbiased and science driven and we dont want it to be influenced by marketing we want our educational activities for whomever we are serving whether its our own faculty or our colleagues in the community locally or globally to be true to the science and the evidence and not be influenced by any kind of financial industry support
8109660 bias either by appearance or reality has become woven into the very fabric of continuing education
8109661 under the present system in many circumstances a cme course will be held only if a commercial company is willing to sponsor it
8109662 while for profit enterprises may occasionally engage in philanthropy it should not be surprising that the core motivation of pharmaceutical and medical device industries in supporting cme is to market their products and services
8109663 this leads to a cme curriculum which is at least in part designed to address market needs rather than being entirely focused upon improving performance of practicing physicians
8109664 clearly it would be preferable for stanford faculty to design our cme curriculum solely based upon the needs of our learners as they seek to address the health care needs of their patients
8109665 we all agreed it is inappropriate for industry to influence content
8109666 if industry really wants to enhance the education of clinicians they should be given the opportunity to do so
8109667 but we wanted to create a situation in which they had no effect on the choice of topics or their content so were happy to have industry support as long as it is provided without strings or expectations about the course content
8109668 really brings control of cme curricula back to academic medical centers
8109669 one of my hopes is to make stanford a destination so we can hold cme programs here leveraging the wonderful cultural attractions on campus
8109670 i think right now industry is under a lot of pressure in its use of marketing for education theyre re examining their role in cme as well
8109671 as we take this step my hope is that other institutions will start to follow suit i think the climate will change dramatically to enforce that if institutions do not take greater responsibility there is going to be a mandate whether its one that we initiate or one that is imposed that frees up these intertwined interactions of academia and industry around medical education

8109678 that equals to about a medal and a half for each hour he spent in combat there were infantry guys grunts on the ground who had more than 7 000 hours in combat and i can tell you that there were times and situations where im sure a prison cell would have looked pretty good to them by comparison the question really is how many guys got that number of medals for not being shot down

8109755 since citibank commercial cards were launched in 1990 the cards have won wide recognition in europe and north america as taiwan powered by the cards strong economy have always played a crucial role in the asia pacific region we decided to introduce commercial cards into the taiwan market in 2008 this will allow taiwanese businesses in step with their asian or even global competitors to enjoy the benefits and convenience brought by this mature business payment tool and sharpen their competitive edge worldwide
8109756 the global business credit card market is expanding by an annual cagr of 10 showing that the product is well recognized as citis customers repeatedly ask when commercial cards will be available in taiwan we have greater confidence about the cards potential in the local market backed up by citis financial expertise accumulated over the past century and 20 years of experience in promoting commercial card globally we believe the cards are not only the convenient and transparent business payment tool worldwide but also part of our long term commitment to taiwan

8109772 we will be fighting for forty years reading those words at the end of norman mailers 1968 miami and the siege of chicago you cant help but feel a chill at that years political conventions the gop performed its lazarus act on richard nixons political career in miami and the democrats appointed hubert humphrey as the public face of their self destruction in chicago while in the streets outside mayor daleys storm troopers brutalized protesters and anyone else in their path these were socio political events begging for the exegesis that mailer that dogged visionary could bring them wrong as often as he was right mailer seems so brave precisely because he was so ready to risk looking foolish
8109773 in 1968 esquires correspondents in chicago were william s burroughs terry southern and jean genet the very possible election of barack obama would bring some sort of arrest to the worst impulses of the republic that mailer sees gaining momentum here the fight for journalism goes on

8109810 all of the lines of inquiry that have been presented to us have been explored and are being investigated

8109817 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8109818 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8109819 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can

8109837 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8109838 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8109839 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8109840 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8109841 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8109842 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8109843 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past

8109860 you keep forgetting things or you pretend to i can see there might be a positive side to this willful averting of the eye ignoring the bad things makes it easier for you to carry on but ignoring the bad things makes you end up believing that bad things never happen you are always surprised by them it surprises you that guns kill that money corrupts that snow falls in winter such naivety can be charming alas it can also be perilous blame someone else thats always your first instinct and if you cant blame someone else then start claiming the problem isnt a problem anyway rewrite the rules shift the goalposts simple case of mistaken identity problem disappears

8109869 we must not say that an action shocks the common conscience because it is criminal but rather that it is criminal because it shocks the common conscience we do not reprove it because it is a crime but it is a crime because we reprove it
8109870 the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena who strives valiantly who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat

8109885 there was some sort of miscommunication i think between their agent and people on my side
8109886 anyways i just assumed that they canceled us and id never hear from them again but in fact they did actually intend to have us this year
8109887 they didnt just cancel my concert they cancelled the whole event

8109892 all computer systems old and new have glitches and as i say they have been infrequent

8109909 es importante que entendamos que el museo es un legado a puerto rico en l hay un espacio para aprender crecer y descubrir un mundo que quiz s muchos no tienen la oportunidad de conocer
8109910 all se aprende de matem ticas ciencia m sica de todo a trav s de las pinturas tambi n se puede conocer sobre las maravillas que puede crear el ser humano y de esa forma se inspira al p blico a hacer esas maravillas
8109911 uno de sus legados m s importantes fue la recontextualizaci n de la universidad para servirle a las transformaciones que puerto rico comenzaba a experimentar l se adelant a esas transformaciones y nutri el paso de la upr hacia los cuadros que la isla necesitaba de profesionales artistas y cient ficos
8109912 cada recinto trabaj su propia propuesta de actividades lo importante es que den las l neas principales del trabajo del rector ben tez y que se convoque a la reflexi n sobre ellas

8109918 we need to let the franchise rest for a while
8109919 if someone rides up to a convenience store with a sawed off shotgun and a prior record im not intimidating anybody by calling the cops if this republican campaign is going to be run in mccarthyite fashion by lawbreakers in an illegal way they are going to pay a price
8109920 why would barack obama be friends with somebody who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8109921 if you cant get excited about voting for mccain these are the kinds of ads that get them excited about voting against obama
8109922 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan
8109923 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8109924 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8109925 and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8109926 the only thing theyre going to do is in old brooklyn terms rabbit punch every day and obama has to show the american people that he can rabbit punch that he can be in that street fight
8109927 i think there was a reluctance initially in the obama campaign to engage in that i think they now realize they have to
8109928 a lot of people came here just because they wanted to celebrate hillary
8109929 we get criticism because theres this idea that the election should move on and just leave her behind were not going down that quietly
8109930 and that is especially important for us to believe on this day because were meeting on a historic day
8109931 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me who knocked on doors and made those phone calls who got into arguments from time to time who contributed so generously to work as hard for barack obama as you did for me
8109932 so lets devote all the passion and the energy we have and theres a lot of it
8109933 it just makes me upset because hillary would have been the perfect woman to do this job
8109934 im a democrat first but its just difficult to get over
8109935 i hate obama so much that im going to devote as much time to mccain as i did to hillary
8109936 obama has nothing he has no experience the democratic party doesnt care about us you couldnt treat clinton any worse
8109937 hillary got a raw deal right we dont want obama right it seems like were on the same team
8109938 hunter biden met with the obama senate office not with senator obama
8109939 its hardly surprising that a senator from illinois would fight for investments in mercy hospital thorek hospital and st xavier university right in illinois or that hed be joined in that effort by a republican colleague representative judy biggert
8109940 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8109941 the confusion here is between john mccain rhetoric that no ones love of country should be questioned and the reality of his campaigns daily false personal and detestable attacks on senator obama
8109942 but its not a surprising tactic from john mccain who is offering four more years of karl roves playbook to distract from his plan for four more years of george bushs failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8109943 it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
8109944 confidence itself and confidence in ones country are not the same
8109945 when they talk about our country it is not with distrust or disdain but with respect and affection they do not resent or resist americas democratic influence in the world they thank god for it
8109946 of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8109947 if i catch senator obamas drift then our failure to lead by example was the liberation of iraq
8109948 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8109949 the teams access to ufo evidence is unparalleled and their expertise allows them to quickly identify bogus claims of ufos
8109950 we are looking at an australian ufo episode for the next season thats for sure
8109951 if i can spot the ufos i will point them out to them
8109952 they dont know what i know i know too much
8109953 we need to let the franchise rest for a while
8109954 we need to let the franchise rest for a while
8109955 actually i think all teams should have domes wouldnt have the rainouts thats what i believe
8109956 we blocked them because one is an anti bankruptcy site and the other is a rag of a newspaper
8109957 people have been kind of up in arms but it seems like a fairly common practice
8109958 i do commend him for not singling out one particular site
8109959 with this bankruptcy filing the city declared war on its employees and our contracts
8109960 now they want the opposition with our hands tied behind our backs and gags in our mouths
8109961 weve talked to the press about factual stuff were not making things up
8109962 tanner is muzzling the employees under the threat of being fired
8109963 the university has now cleared the most significant legal hurdle
8109964 were one giant step closer to being able to begin construction
8109965 whatever we have to do we will do to maintain the injunction
8109966 if the court takes a year to make a decision the injunction will stay in place for a year
8109967 why the hell did we get this thing this is rediculious

8109977 take away the dross from the silver and there comes out a vessel for the smith
8109978 therefore since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us
8109979 blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life which god has promised to those who love him
8109980 thy hand bestows blessings thy power averts evil i bring my tribute of thanks for spiritual graces blessed be my sovereign lord
