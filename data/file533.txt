5330014 your honor i have checked my records and i did give this man brains what he did with it only man knows as far as my records are concerned he hasnt used his brain since the second grade
5330015 i also gave this man other talents and abilities along with an instruction manual so he would know how to use them according to my records he has never read the instruction manual as far as i can see he has used his talents and abilities for selfish purposes and not to glorify me

5330029 the neuroscientists idea of a game is rock paper scissors which is zero sum whereas economists have focused on strategic games that produce gains through collaboration
5330030 from moment to moment the hedonimeter varies the delicate index now flickering with the flutter of the passions now steadied by intellectual activity low sunk whole hours in the neighbourhood of zero or momentarily springing up towards infinity
5330031 economics became a deductive science because we didnt have the tools to gather information inductively now better statistical tools and neuroscience are opening up the possibility that economics can become an abductive science that combines elements of deductive and inductive reasoning
5330032 curiosity about neuroscience among economists has outstripped what we have to say for now
5330033 blood flow is an indirect measure of what goes on in the head a blunt instrument
5330034 in many areas of economics it will dominate because it works
5330035 we are nowhere near the demise of traditional neoclassical economics
5330036 these traditional economists may be more impressed by brain evidence than evidence from psychology

5330050 based on the experience of countries like spain portugal greece and south korea emigration usually slows when income per person approaches a threshold level in relation to income in the richer countries where the migrants are heading
5330051 for migrants looking to go to western europe and north america this would imply a threshold level of 6 000 7 000

5330061 hopefully ill be selected for that game because it should be a good match and im keen to get as much game time under my belt as possible before the start of the season
5330062 there are still a few things we need to work on and weve got the games this week to do that but we also showed what we are capable of on friday we scored a great try in the second half and the boys are really excited about how we want to play the game this season
5330063 clearly we still need to get a bit more consistentcy in our play and also making sure we retain possession a lot better but there were lots of positives from the game to take into this week

5330071 this is a decision that broadcasts weakness and complacence with the current situation
5330072 prisoners are happy for everybody who is released especially if they conducted attacks inside israel and killed people
5330073 the government will make every possible effort for the release of prisoners from israeli jails

5330077 we havent simply come up with a list of plays and slotted people in we have encouraged artists to come forward with their own dream projects we see our responsibility as supporting those artists to help them fulfill their dreams and visions this is the best way to serve not only them but our audiences the key to creating transcendent theatre is having passionate people at the helm of each production
5330078 from one of canadas most celebrated writers will be announced at a later date along with titles and details of these projects
5330079 its important for us as a classical repertory theatre to have living playwrights in our midst
5330080 it helps keep us honest in our approach to the classics reminding us that our productions must speak to burning contemporary issues and the important subjects of our own times contemporary writers can gain a great deal in turn by having their works produced alongside the great plays of dramatic literature the classics feed and inform new plays just as our own writers help us to focus on the pertinence of the classics

5330095 although we think the term stagflation greatly exaggerates the pain in the us economy at least relative to the 1970s when it was initially coined it certainly describes the feel of the past weeks economic data
5330096 inflation surprised on the upside while sentiment remained poor credit conditions tightened and domestic economic activity flagged the only bright spot in the economy is the massive improvement in trade with the rest of the world
5330097 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5330101 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5330102 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5330103 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5330118 i think its fair to say that bob has never been afraid to embrace controversial issues or positions and always had a knack for turning his actions into ink
5330119 the curse is that people view him as being this bombastic character who really is more thoughtful and has a greater degree of moderation

5330193 but once you have a trial use by the consumer of this service there is very high customer satisfaction
5330194 we see clinics as an emerging industry and we expect to see continued changes and evolution in that space but i can tell you that we are excited about the strong interest that we are getting from hospitals and health care systems
5330195 the bottom line is that its difficult to first of all get this idea across and make people aware of where these locations are and then finally to feel comfortable to actually get their health care in a retail store
5330196 i sprayed a lot of it when i was on the podium but there was still loads left and ive filled two 750 bottles and 500 bottle we went out for a pizza to celebrate because it was such a good win capodarco is a huge race in italy and is held in memory of fabio casartelli who won the olympic road race in barcelona and who died in the tour de france

5330198 i suffered at the start of the season because the racing is so much faster here i remember spending a lot of time in the gruppetto at the giro delle regioni stage race and it wasnt nice but ive slowly improved ive learnt a lot from working and watching ben swift
5330199 i was part of the 27 rider break that formed on the flat roads with about 80km to go but the gap kept coming down because people were messing around i attacked and ended up on my own after the climb at first i didnt know what to do because rod was too far away to speak over the radio i decided to ride steady and then eventually rod told me there were some other riders coming across
5330200 the aussie simon clarke was one of them with a team mate and there was a russian as well the other aussie worked on the flat and then sat up on the final climb to the finish we did a few turns each and then the russian got dropped clarke really wanted to win but i called his bluff by pretending to be tired he thought hed win took the bait and lead up the climb but then with about 500 metres i went passed him and gapped him winning was awesome
5330201 me and ben put our trophies under a montage of photographs in our bedroom in the apartment and now its getting pretty full

5330210 the nuclear arms race left us with 16 major and 100 minor sites all around the country that need to be cleaned up
5330211 the russians were making more of this stuff nuclear weapons than the us so we had to make more too
5330212 dealing with this issue has been a race against time for awhile now
5330213 theyre all going to leak within a matter of time and the government needs to face that reality
5330214 preventing further contamination and getting contamination from the groundwater is a top priority in the clean up

5330251 to retain an unbroken presence on the newsstand for the last six years is a testimony to the dedication and hard work of all the people who work and support the magazine it seemed entirely fitting that we should therefore do something special to celebrate our 50th edition and since we have always had a top quality photography in the magazine since issue 1 producing four covers for our readers seemed particularly appropriate
5330252 i think after 9 11 my friends we should have told americans to join the peace corps expand the military serve a cause greater than your self interest
5330253 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5330254 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
5330255 i have to tell you up front both of these guys are my friends they both care deeply about america they are both patriots
5330256 they have very different ideas on how america can be strengthened
5330257 i was so obsessed with me and the reasons i might be dissatisfied i couldnt focus on other people
5330258 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage

5330263 they achieved a revolution now the russians are coming in there in an act of aggression we have to not only bring about cease fire we have to have honor
5330264 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5330265 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5330266 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5330267 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5330268 solving big problems are not going to be easy we are all going to think about how we using things energy wise if we pretend like everything is free we are betraying the tradition of america
5330269 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
5330270 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5330271 a union is between man and woman between one man and one woman
5330272 whatever you do for the least of my brother you do for me

5330287 i was wondering if you have accepted jesus christ as your lord and savior
5330288 i have deep religious beliefs and values i had experiences in my life where i had to rely on god not to get me through another day or another hour but another minute
5330289 i also believe that talking too much about ones faith and religion in my view is something between me and god
5330290 i have attended north phoenix baptist church for many years and the most important thing is that im a christian
5330291 i dont have anything else to say about the issue

5330305 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognizing the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5330306 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5330307 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5330308 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5330309 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5330310 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved
5330311 not a warm and fuzzy environment where people sing kumbaya around the fireplace
5330312 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5330313 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5330314 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people
5330315 normally the people you find at the core of open source projects are professional software engineers these guys know how to run software projects
5330316 a compelling interest in protecting both the secrecy of information important to our national security and the appearance of confidentiality so essential to the effective operation of our foreign intelligence service
5330317 the replacement of systems does not automatically equate to new software market growth

5330342 one of the central errors westerners are constantly assaulted with is the use of this term jihad
5330343 the central jihad for all of us is to constantly improve and be the best we can be and try to adhere to some very pure ideals
5330344 islam values life above anything we are taught in the quran that mans right to life exceeds even gods rights on man
5330345 the book is important because in this country in the sound bite generation stereotypes pretty much prevail
5330346 when americans in general think of muslims really the radical islam aspect of it comes to mind where we think this book is really important is that is humanizes muslims and builds bridges between the two cultures
5330347 you see so very few articulate moderate voices coming out where are the movies where is the music where is the poetry where are the books to counteract some of this violent ideology
5330348 in a thoughtless flourish i found myself now subject to the laws of saudi arabia decapitation included

5330363 we are working at the ultimate edge of what is possible progressing toward advanced next generation semiconductor technologies
5330364 this new development is a critical achievement in the pursuit to continually drive miniaturization in microelectronics
5330365 leading edge complex high speed ics create very challenging ic package designs both from a physical implementation and a signal and power integrity aspect
5330366 with todays focus on product miniaturization increased designer productivity and efficient pdn design we feel that spb16 2 will help designers better address their design challenges
5330367 with wirebond packages becoming increasingly complex the designer is being challenged to design in dfm compliance in order to avoid manufacturing issues
5330368 by joining forces we can now deliver dfm proven loop profile libraries to the design communitys desktop
5330369 this new release provides significant enhancements to our ic packaging and sip technologies and were glad to see companies such as bayside design benefiting from its use
5330370 we are committed to evolving our technology and building relationships with key design chain players in order to maintain our leadership role in helping designers meet and exceed their design goals

5330378 you cant produce your product in one country and sell it in another you can do it with laptop computers but you cant do it with a game
5330379 its hard to get people interested in a baseball team on the other side of the world
5330380 where they are going to sell their cars in the future
5330381 weve got to find a way to get more games
5330382 the only way you could do that before was to get on a field you can do that all digitally
5330383 all the clubs agreed to take a look at this over a long period
5330384 the clubs are still keen to see us developing some kind of international strategic play i sit here not knowing in what variant it will come back but it will come back
5330385 we hope theyll be interested in our sport if theyre going to be interested in our sport we hope theyll be interested in us
5330386 the propensity to truck barter and exchange one thing for another is common to all men and to be found in no other race of animals
5330387 normally theres 120 players from away and 60 from the amherst area
5330388 these guys get approached to sponsor a lot of events
5330389 so for them to take on this challenge is greatly appreciated
5330390 people come here from away and stay here and eat here
5330391 so its good for the community and its good for all the businesses in the community
5330392 i think our club champion mitchell roy has a good chance and mark gould and gary carter will be in the mix
5330393 the loss means we will host the first playoff game this friday night at the winston field in amherst
5330394 doc dylans are the five year running defending champions but this year they finished in fifth because theres a lot of strong teams out there this year
5330395 if you win friday you play a game on saturday if you win saturday you go to the final on sunday
5330396 we found ourselves down 3 0 in the first half but came back to win the game 5 3
5330397 i put all the blood the sweat you name it all the time into competing working out now its time for me to go out there tuesday and shine
5330398 i waited and waited donovan bailey and i were over there chatting and he said im a pretty confident guy i think youll get through so when he said that i was pretty convinced i would get through
5330399 being out there blind the whole race was tough but its the olympic games im blessed to be here if they made me run in the first row of the crowd i would have done that too
5330400 i dont think it was serious but i didnt want to go and risk any more damage turn a strain into a pull because i felt a little discomfort coming around the corner there so i just eased up
5330401 our door is open to negotiation and the movement will be called off only if our demand is fulfilled
5330402 we are not launching an agitation against any industry we only want to hear about the return of the 400 acre of land
5330403 buddhadeb should accept my challenge that it is wrong information or otherwise he should resign
5330404 if the government is really interested to set up the nano car plant it should build it on the 600 acre and start searching for additional land for ancillary industries elsewhere
5330405 i will never compromise on peoples movement i am ready to shed blood rather than bow my head
5330406 how the vacuum is handled by the civilian government how much control they can exercise on the radical elements remains to be seen
5330407 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5330408 india will continue to have an amicable relation with pakistan in the days to come
5330409 after four good years in which india had high hopes for the peace process in the last four months the opposite has happened
5330410 musharraf was seen by india as decisive and ready to engage compared with the chaos and division of the last few months
5330411 the isi enjoyed greater autonomy since musharrafs wings were clipped
5330412 once he is removed from the scene isi may have even greater autonomy
5330413 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view
5330414 but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on pak istan afghan border but clearly our side of the border too
5330415 grassroots opposition to the liberal carbon tax is growing as evidenced by this cool new site
5330416 dyfed powys is a very high performing force and want im keen to do is build upon the solid foundations that already exist here
5330417 clearly ive got some areas i want to concentrate on one in particular is to make sure that we concentrate on the minor crimes as well as the more serious crimes
5330418 im sending some very very clear messages to our staff about the levels of service dress and presentation that i expect from them at all times
5330419 im particularly keen to use technology to minimise some of the problems of geography that is a major issue for us such a large area limited resources managing that to public expectations is a constant challenge
5330420 also through proper communications we can make sure we can send cars to where they are required
5330421 we want to increase the visibility of our staff and perhaps the main thing we can do in that area is make sure they are sent to the right incidents
5330422 our police community support officers pcsos are vital to improving visibility across the force area and we want to make sure they are out nearly all of their time
5330423 if at all possible we will seek to increase their numbers in forthcoming years
5330424 in my first three months here there have been three murders and some very very serious offences and ive been very pleased to see we have the staff with the skills and the expertise to deal with those issues
5330425 one of the core issues for us at the moment is 60 of the people passing through our custody suites have a form of drug problem or certainly have drugs in their system at the time of arrest
5330426 at the moment we have not got access to treatment or support services for those individuals
5330427 i think what needs to happen is politicians and the government need to rise above party politics so people can be supported and helped
5330428 otherwise we will just be arresting people releasing them and seeing the same people come through custody time and time again
5330429 this order reflects the growing excitement around our new learjet 85 program in latin america and worldwide
5330430 the learjet 85 jet is the latest example of how the evolving learjet aircraft family is well suited to respond to the changing needs of latin american operators
5330431 we want to offer our customers the best business aircraft possible and we believe the learjet 85 aircraft will meet and even exceed their high standards
5330432 we are reorganizing our styrenics business to improve its future success and give us new options outside of basf
5330433 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
5330434 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
5330435 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
5330436 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
5330437 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
5330438 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 per cent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
5330439 millions of people depend on freshwater fisheries as a major food source
5330440 freshwater food stocks can provide up to 80 per cent of dietary protein for the 60 million people of the mekong basin for example and thats just one river
5330441 freshwater systems are home to around 40 per cent of all the species on earth
5330442 and our impact is shown by the fact that we are losing these species faster than any other
5330443 a global treaty for co operatively managing rivers and lakes that cross or form borders is still languishing in limbo more than a decade after being approved by a clear majority in the united nations
5330444 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on
5330445 maintaining the health of freshwater ecosystems has to become one of the major aims of freshwater management generally
5330446 we are also concerned that the world continues to mainly discuss adaption to climate change rather than doing it
5330447 we have been doing it all over the world and we have found that that improving the health of freshwater ecosystems now makes a great contribution to improving their resilience to climate impacts in the future
5330448 it is ironic that currently it is not foresight and planning but major natural disasters that lead to significant efforts to repair damaged rivers and wetlands foresight and planning now will reduce the risk and damage from future extreme weather events while having many economic social and environmental benefits
5330449 even this tiny proportion however would be enough for humans to live on earth if the water cycle was properly functioning and if we managed our water use wisely
5330450 scrap tires along the u s mexico border pose major health threats for the millions of border residents
5330451 with the support of both of our countries we can prevent the creation of additional scrap tire piles and clean up our border communities
5330452 we welcome ea into our formal process and look forward to demonstrating to their board the significant strides made by take two since they last undertook a detailed review of our business in early 2007 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate and undervalued world class entertainment franchises and our strong operational and financial performance

5330569 we are all rednecks up here we dont carry it around as a badge of shame we carry it around as a badge of honour
5330570 id suggest cr molony go off to school somewhere and get educated about what responsibility he holds on behalf of the community etiquette school perhaps
5330571 what do these sorts of statements say about our community its horrifying that in this day and age a public figure would say such things what era is he living in
5330572 but hes correct in saying there is a gender imbalance there are a lot of young men in town who would love to have families and would love to have a partner
5330573 mount isa has a lot more going for it than just its male versus female population ratio

5330589 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason
5330590 the party needs to face the fact that without hillary clinton on the ticket the democrats will probably lose
5330591 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred
5330592 they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that
5330593 its not something that i would have recommended but theyre trying to bend over backwards as far as they can to accommodate her
5330594 i think the roll call will be a cathartic moment
5330595 there will be a lot of people who will say oh what might have been and will vote for obama but there will be a lot of tears
5330596 were not going to win by pretending problems with barack obama dont exist he has a huge problem connecting with ordinary americans who think he doesnt understand me he is not modest he is arrogant he radiates elitism
5330597 it is not disloyal to raise legitimate questions about barack obama
5330598 he started running for president before he even set foot in the us senate
5330599 no matter what he says he has not explained properly why he sat next to reverend jeremiah wright his former pastor for 20 years he talks about an end to partisanship but he has no record of reaching across the aisle for any purpose
5330600 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
5330601 barack obama can use the words the american dream but they dont resonate
5330602 he magnified the problem by going to berlin and calling himself a citizen of the world
5330603 he has provided her with a pittance compared to what the clintons have given obama
5330604 her debt could have been cleared within 10 days its ungracious
5330605 barack obama would not stand up and say its outrageous its not permissible and speak up for him
5330606 but ultimately he understands what he has got to do in terms of supporting the candidate and the party
5330607 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
5330608 ignores her students mostly a very false personality and especially when handing out praise incredibly patronising and not very bright

5330614 the challenge facing us is pretty realistic in terms of the difficulties soldiers are facing in the battlefield today what we needed was a system that could look high and low and present as complete a picture of the environment as possible
5330615 combining the autonomous ground vehicle with the small uav and the blimp has enabled us to do just that and we are very confident that the technologies weve used will meet the demands of the challenge
5330616 we have a long standing relationship with mira which has been instrumental in helping us develop and test autonomous technologies effectively we are extremely pleased to be supporting their grand challenge entry and believe the team has devised an elegant solution capable of performing well at copehill down

5330627 it is one of queenslands great regional cities and individuals and families continue to move there for employment and lifestyle opportunities and if they fall in love while theyre there good luck to them
5330628 it could be the type of person attracted to farming are those that want to work in isolation theyre introverted a whole heap of things that might be correlated with depression so theyre vulnerable
5330629 we could also hypothesise that theres less help seeking services in rural areas
5330630 if we are serious about reducing global greenhouse emissions the nuclear option is one we cannot ignore
5330631 the biggest gains in cutting greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in the shortest possible time and at the lowest cost and least economic risk will come from nuclear power
5330632 its a black and white answer or should i say black and yellow answer clean coal and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future base load clean energy mix

5330643 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
5330644 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
5330645 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
5330646 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
5330647 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
5330648 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
5330649 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
5330650 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
5330651 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
5330652 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
5330653 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
5330654 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
5330655 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
5330656 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
5330657 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more

5330661 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
5330662 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
5330663 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
5330664 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
5330665 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5330666 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5330667 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5330668 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5330669 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5330670 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5330671 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership

5330776 the treadmill was easy to assemble and only required a phillips head screw driver there is one included but a normal one is better the machine has worked well and is easy to move in front of the tv for the early morning routine
5330777 this arrived within just a couple weeks perfect condition it is excellent and easy to use one problem that is minor is that the hand grip pulse reading does not work at all once out of every 20 times it might work briefly the polar strap on pulse transmitter works excellent though the fan is rather stupid and unnecessary but you dont have to turn it on the programs are good to very good
5330778 i am very pleased with its performance and it is easily the equivalent of the best treadmills i have used in professional health spas
5330779 the bowflex series 7 was listed 1 on consumer reports when i purchased mine two months ago and i have been extremely happy with it
5330780 i read many of the great reviews about this product before purchasing it it worked well for the 1st month and then electronics failed now these things do happen even to good products the replacement of the parts is covered under the warranty
5330781 the one feature that influenced my decision to buy this unit was the built in fan it has three speeds even on high it doesnt move much air at all so we will have to get a fan anyway dont buy based on the fan
5330782 finally resolved the broken fan problem i had to disassemble the entire console and replace the broken fan took about 30 minutes i should not even had bothered getting the replacement fan because it is absolutely useless
5330783 the console is pretty weak the main text area is 2 characters which makes it awkward to read messages as text scrolls by i really dont understand why the couldnt have made it 3 or 4 characters which would have made a big difference i dont really care much about the console for my personal use but if you are used to big displays like you see on gym machines you will be very disappointed in this aspect

5330837 sebagai suami dia perlu bersedia dan sentiasa cuba meluangkan masa mendengar apa juga perkara yang hendak diluahkan oleh pasangannya
5330838 sekurang kurangnya dengan cara tersebut banyak perkara boleh diselesaikan secara baik
5330839 di kalangan isteri yang sudah mengenali keluarga suami mungkin masalah ini tidak dianggap besar malah apabila mereka berpeluang tinggal serumah secara tidak langsung merapatkan hubungan sesama mereka
5330840 dari segi penjagaan anak juga turut mendatangkan masalah kepada pasangan ini apalagi terdapat tiga pasangan tinggal serumah
5330841 anak anak mungkin menjadi punca pertelagahan sesama adik beradik atau ipar duai masing masing mungkin menyimpan rasa kurang menyenangi antara satu dengan yang lain
5330842 seorang wanita seharusnya bersedia menghadapi sebarang kemungkinan sekiranya suatu hari nanti mereka terpaksa tinggal bersama mertua selepas berumah tangga
5330843 selain bertolak ansur dan hormat menghormati antara satu dengan lain sikap sabar adalah antara kunci bagi mengelakkan timbulnya konflik yang berpanjangan antara menantu dan mertua
5330844 sepatutnya kita di pihak menantu kena menjaga hati mereka tetapi kita amat berharaplah agar ibu bapa mertua juga matang dan tidak melihat menantu sebagai lawan
5330845 suami seharusnya bijak meletakkan ibu dan isteri kepada kedudukan yang sepatutnya bagi mengelakkan pertelagahan sesama mereka berlanjutan sehingga menjejaskan hubungan kedua belah pihak
5330846 ini semua terpulang kepada kebijaksanaan seseorang menghadapi dan menyelesaikan konflik yang akan dihadapi oleh mereka apabila berada di tengah tengah keluarga mertua
5330847 sekiranya menantu faham akan tanggungjawab dan peranan mereka begitu juga dengan ibu atau bapa mertua tidak akan timbul masalah yang boleh menjejaskan hubungan sekeluarga
5330848 seharusnya isteri memikirkan tanggungjawab yang perlu dipikul oleh suami dan tidak terlalu mementing diri atas pelbagai alasan seperti tidak bebas dan sebagainya

5330853 green lean and sustainable the new era of automotive recycling
5330854 the launch of this training tool is another major achievement for urg
5330855 it fills a crucial need and we expect it to be used extensively by recyclers as well as others in the collision and repair and insurance industries the automotive recycling industry is changing dramatically and its important for everyone to understand who we are today automotive recycling is green it is sustainable and it is very cost effective our quality is top notch and the use of our original equipment oe recycled parts means the insurance industry body shops and the end customer all need to know that they are getting best in class when they buy recycled this presentation does that and more
5330856 the ara is excited about this opportunity and wholly supports and endorses this presentation we enthusiastically encourage everyone to view it and use it the ara will be using this training tool as a component in a comprehensive nationwide legislative program designed to help elected officials and others in government understand what we do in the automotive recycling industry
5330857 the recycling industry has an exciting story to tell regarding the innovative advancements that have been made over the years consumers today should understand that best in class recyclers run their operations with highly trained personnel who use sophisticated models and provide top notch customer service many recyclers are dedicated to green initiatives by processing salvage in an environmentally friendly manner this has the added benefits of increasing the supply of alternative parts reducing the demand for original equipment manufacturer oem parts which in turn reduces the amount of material added to our landfills
5330858 this presentation will help improve the understanding and use of recycled auto parts
5330859 this training tool is important to asa because it will give us the ability to improve communication between our members in the repair industry with insurers and automotive recyclers we all share a common goal of improving the repair industry and now weve got a great educational tool for everyone
5330860 the damaged vehicle repair industry is on the front lines when it comes to dealing with consumers and the use of recycled auto parts
5330861 most of our customers need more information about the benefits of recycled auto parts especially the green and cost savings aspects this presentation will be a great tool for helping us in the repair industry have the information we need to get the message out
5330862 we will directly benefit from the widespread use of this presentation
5330863 in this tight economy the cost effectiveness of auto parts recycling makes more sense than ever not only that but its green its sustainable and it just makes good business sense the urg advisory group is in the right place at the right time with this training tool
5330864 this training tool is a great first step in bringing the recycling industry together to continue to develop the best practices and standards our industry can use to drive awareness in the collision and mechanical repair markets i predict it is going to be used widely
5330865 green lean and sustainable the new era of automotive recycling
5330866 what we are really trying to do with this presentation is get everyone up to date
5330867 most people still conjure up an image of the old fashioned junkyard when they hear about automotive recycling its important to change that misperception and understand that our industry is green lean and sustainable the urg advisory group has worked hard to produce an outstanding training tool and we invite anyone interested to contact us for a copy

5330869 since its founding 40 years ago gutmann has developed into one of the leading specialists for vehicle diagnostic systems for hella the foundation of the joint venture with the name hella gutmann solutions is an ideal partnership and the optimum further development of its own activities in the field of technical data and control unit diagnostics which we started successfully with hella dds
5330870 since even the simplest repairs cannot be carried out without diagnostic competence it is important to occupy this strategic field with a strong partner like gutmann we have been very successful in doing so
5330871 with hella we have found a partner that suits us very well both in terms of strategic orientation and corporate structure the international hella sales network offers the possibility of further accelerating international expansion and of placing our competence as a partner of garages on a broader basis
5330872 everything from a single source supplier for garages in the case of data test equipment spare parts training and hotline this means that the complete garage process is supported in an optimum manner
5330873 real life safety is the key to our safety philosophy when it comes to preventive safety we have the same approach as when we develop protective systems in other words that our research and technical development focus on areas where new technology can create significant results in real life traffic
5330874 we do not monitor human behaviour which varies from one person to another but instead the effect that fatigue or decreased concentration has on driving behaviour our technology is based on the cars progress on the road it gives a reliable indication if something is likely to go wrong and alerts the driver before it is too late
5330875 we often get questions about why we have chosen this concept instead of monitoring the drivers eyes the answer is that we dont think that the technology for monitoring the drivers eyes is mature enough yet
5330876 this is a positive side effect of our concept and this is possible since the feature evaluates driving behaviour rather than human behaviour
5330877 it is of course always the drivers responsibility to take a break when necessary but sometimes you might not realise that youre not alert enough to drive in such situations driver alert control can help the driver make the right decision like taking a refreshing break or a nap before the concentration level becomes too low
5330878 what new evidence how can there be new evidence now she died months ago she was cremated her rooms not even a crime been living there for weeks what could you have possibly found

5330885 at the time of the murder i was asleep in my bed while my roommate was asleep in hers i woke up to the sound of screaming and ran down the hall to find the president of my dorm dead on the floor of her room thats all i know now why dont you go interview someone with oh i dont know a motive
5330886 looks like youre going back to where youve always belonged
5330887 but when i single handedly delivered the crom a check for over five million dollars to use as he pleases he pretty much intimated that i can do whatever i want around here
5330888 dont make it worse by getting all pathetic and whiny about it
5330889 dash was and is mine and even if we had been broken up you dont go there not with a friends ex

5330913 the sudanese government remains responsible for massive atrocities in darfur
5330914 to suspend the icc investigation in response to khartoums outrageous threats and empty promises would be to betray the victims in darfur
5330915 there has been no improvement in the situation on the ground in darfur nor in the behaviour of the sudanese government that would in any way justify such a suspension at this time
5330916 the peacocks the buffalo and even the rhea a south american bird that resembles an ostrich disappeared
5330917 the hyaenas became vegetarians the zoo was depopulated and even the tigers had only sweet potatoes and a bit of cassava to eat

5330921 just like every other developer we signed up for the program and downloaded the sdk even though there were some specific clauses in the developer agreement that said you cant write gps navigation applications

5330923 we will have to look more closely to apples strategy before we can say more about what kind of opportunities this will bring us
5330924 when i spoke to apple they didnt say such applications would be prohibited
5330925 what is clear is that there arent any available yet
5330926 dhanani said telenav has proceeded ahead with its gps program telenav navigator for the iphone and found that it works quite well on the device
5330927 hard to say because apple does have to update their agreement for navigation to happen
5330928 we figured its a big category navigation and apple will change their stance because theres going to be a lot of consumer demand for it

5330974 columbus and mercedes discussed compatibility issues between columbus ranger and mercedes vehicle computers mercedes executives received detailed specifications of the ranger and examined a customized ranger demo covering the stuttgart region prepared specifically for mercedes i am pleased to state that mercedes was impressed with our product and asked columbus to address several additional issues to facilitate the integration of the ranger in mercedes vehicles we agreed to meet again to promote this issue further
5330975 leading auto manufactures such as mercedes benz are looking for navigation solutions for the in car pc system fitted in each new vehicle our product ranger clearly meets this need for an off road navigation solution particularly for truck and 4x4 cross country vehicle drivers
5330976 these contacts with mercedes benz are a critical element of our strategy to establish ranger as the leading off road navigation solution integrated in new vehicles we are optimistic following the initial trial results and look forward to working with mercedes benz as well as other leading global auto manufacturers
5330977 it won the first race at watkins glen in 1948 and though the cars been driven quite a bit its never been wrecked ive always been an alfa fan so winning at pebble beach just doesnt get much better i cant wait to take it back on the road real soon
5330978 it takes an amazing level of elegance for a closed car like this alfa to win here
5330979 it requires the ultimate in style grace and proportion this car has all of that it has exquisite lines balance and all of the excitement that only an 8c alfa can provide
5330980 the pebble beach concours has truly become the worlds concours in addition to enthusiasts sponsors and media from around the globe this year we welcomed exotic historic vehicles from as far away as hong kong monaco germany and brazil
5330981 this is an m47 patton tank engine with twin turbos it has 1 600 horsepower and weighs about five tons
5330982 thats not really much when you consider the engine is meant to move a 120 000 pound tank maybe you build cars like this when you have more money than brains but ive driven it to work and its gotten up to 145 mph at the gm proving grounds
5330983 actually most people dont know this is really a hybrid it starts off running on gas then you get on the freeway and it runs on even more gas
5330984 and the best news of all with the 1 million plus we raised for our charities this year the pebble beach concours has now contributed well over 11 million during the events history

5330996 wow we dont know what it is but its great
5330997 this place makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside like a gathering of impossibly soft pink bunnies
5330998 we are putting a key performance indicator to the advertiser we say if you spend 10 000 with us we will guarantee 30 000 of coverage
5330999 sales journalists would write the pitch so theres more knowledge of how the editorial would look and hence more trust
5331000 besides prostitution the oldest industry in the world is probably publishing this traditional industry now faces its greatest threat and common wisdom says its the internet invasion
5331001 however the actual challenge comes from within as the industry views the interests of readers and advertisers as opposing
5331002 nobody would be able to buy a better review period if a product is not up to scratch that is what we would write about in the review
5331003 of course there is a risk that journalistic integrity will be compromised but the risk is no higher than with a journalist being sent on an all expenses paid trip who is asked to write about it is there full integrity there
5331004 i would like to emphasize that we have a team of sales journalists and an editorial team the editorial team operated independently of the sales journalists however the editor has final say over the content that the sales journalists produce when it comes to editorial integrity the editor is the last layer to ensure that what is printed is in keeping with our editorial objectives
5331005 when journalists are paid to write for clients they could face potential conflict of interest that of being an employee of their news agency vis vis earning outside monies
5331006 the line of ethics is problematic sales articles should be done by public relations professionals
5331007 as soon as you have a commission the impetus is there to sell advertisements
5331008 ive written here join me luke embrace the dark side and we will rule the universe as father and son it seems to be going in that direction
5331009 i dont see how you can maintain the journalistic integrity
5331010 they were not supposed to make love these were two contradictory jobs which were supposed to have dynamic tension and fight each other the ceo produced the money whilst the editor in chief spent it
5331011 when we have 900 products obviously advertisers who pay more will be given better positioning
5331012 a watch is a watch im not sure how much journalism is involved in featuring a watch
5331013 there are two types of writers one that wants to win a pulitzer prize and one that is very good in sales
5331014 i realise the implication of a sales journalist but this is where the world is going
5331015 by creating the sales journalist we are just being more forthright in our approach
5331016 mica is well aware of the fact that internet and new media technology have evolved by leaps and bounds since we introduced our light touch approach in 1996
5331017 hence our response to the internet was to take a balanced light touch approach
5331018 to keep up with the fast evolving new media landscape we have been reviewing our light touch approach and are considering how we could take a lighter touch approach we have appointed the advisory council on the impact of new media on society aims in april last year to study the new media and how best to refine our regulatory framework

5331027 i think the music industry is about to enter into a golden age its wonderful i dont think record companies need to sell cds major labels need something cheap that they can sell bulk of or theyre going to go under small companies like myself that kind of evolved to be the cockroaches in the music industry to survive on meager sustenance were going to be fine were the ones who will be left when the whole thing craters music consumption is up its cd sales that are down my kid doesnt have a single cd not one
5331028 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5331029 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5331030 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality and its definitely a sensual album
5331031 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5331032 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5331033 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5331034 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say
5331035 i would say that an official girl is someone in a relationship

5331042 tras esa investigacion fue posible confirmar que las instituciones valoran mucho los provedores que entregan un servicio eficiente y un excelente servicio de atencion al cliente por ese motivo es critico establecer y ampliar el canal de registro a traves de distribuidores autorizados como dattatec com en argentina e interplanet en el pais mexicano

5331049 there are excellent throwers here who have been to tons more olympics than i have i dont have as much experience as they do its an awesome feeling to have the peace of mind to come back with the gold medal
5331050 i really hope it will set a precedent for the u s team
5331051 we need as many gold medals as we can get i was shocked when someone told me it was the first gold medal in track and field for the usa i hope its not the last it better not be the last

5331053 its an honor to be mentioned in the same breath as edwin moses

5331080 maybe take up as outlined above with no measles vaccination boys only mumps and rubella for girls would chew deeply into the profit margins
5331081 last summer there was a news report of a doctor who came down with mumps several times
5331082 here are the stories about mmr as a cocktail vaccine it is possible to have each component of the vaccine separately here are my comments as your doctor the choice is yours
5331083 but isnt mmr less expensive than the three vaccines given separately
5331084 and how does not vaccinating for measles then vaccinating only half of the population for mumps and rubella keep money away from the pharmaceutical companies

5331151 eu sempre quis fazer um livro relacionado ao rock escrevi muito para jornais de s o paulo e uma coisa que eu sempre tive em mente era uma hora reunir todos meus artigos e a partir disso fazer um livro

5331153 procurei ser imparcial e n o puxar sardinha para o meu lado para as coisas que gosto mais acredito que consegui falar de expoentes e coisas legais do rock sem ser tiete tamb m n o quis ser cr tico n o era o intuito do livro
5331154 foi dif cil escolher quem ilustraria a capa entre tantos cones mas acho que foi uma escolha feliz tem o raul seixas representando o rock brasileiro a bjork e a janis joplin representando as mulheres o jack white que eu acho importante nessa nova gera o se eu pudesse colocar mais fotos na capa eu colocava um dilema morrisey eu adoro e n o entrou robert smith tamb m quase entrou que s o figuras emblem ticas ai coloquei o ramones para representar os anos 80 e o punk

5331179 right now id stack our prospects up against anybody elses
5331180 we just think hes the all around type of center that we have been looking for that we dont have
5331181 hes a player that can play in all situations he has good offensive instincts and hes shown that hes a guy that can play defensively and hes shown that he has good size hell be a big strong center which is something we have been coveting
5331182 he made the adjustment from northern michigan and learned about longer schedule and stronger players
5331183 he has good offensive skills and is rounding out his game now the offensive skill set is in place for him and with all that hes learned he could make a big jump were hoping for him
5331184 he makes the people around him better with the way he sees the ice and can make plays his scoring needs to pick up a bit in terms of pace but he can play up to the pace so we think hell move up to the american league next year and the higher tempo will help as he gains leg strength his skating skills will come out
5331185 i think hes in a good situation at notre dame
5331186 his game is only going to continue to develop there
5331187 he had a really good year and jumped up in his production
5331188 hes a good two way guy thats the core of his game he kills penalties blocks shots and has a physical aspect to his game he blossomed on the offensive side this year and should take on more of a leadership role at wisconsin its a year by year analysis with him
5331189 he didnt produce quite as much as he could have his sophomore year but he did score 20 goals as a freshman
5331190 expectations might have been too high but he finished the year strong
5331191 we have him signed and hell be in training camp
5331192 i really believe he will make the predators this year i think he can really be on our team
5331193 the one thing we have never done is rush our prospects because were concerned about them being solid players for us five six seven years from now
5331194 were in a fortunate situation with our d that we dont have to force our guys it would be great if he came in and pushed but our plan right now is for him to go back to vancouver and go back to world juniors with the u s
5331195 our hope is hell push in training camp but if he needs more time so be it
5331196 cody is a big rangy guy who shoots and passes the puck extremely well he learned a lot in terms of the defensive side this year in milwaukee and made strides were looking forward to him coming to camp
5331197 he got good experience playing in a mens league in germany and he was mature coming over
5331198 he had a good year for us but had a groin injury late in the year he was probably our most reliable guy in milwaukee this year with his two way game we definitely see him in our plans
5331199 he has one more year in plymouth and i think with a year under his belt as a starter there and knowing how to carry the load it will pay dividends for him
5331200 i would say hell certainly be in the running for team canada
5331201 he had an excellent year at tri city i think he led the league in wins and played 90 percent of their games he was a real workhorse for them much the way carey price was there are similarities there with his size and his demeanor he doesnt get rattled by much he takes away a lot of net and controls his game pretty well
5331202 we really feel confident that hes ready to play in the nhl hes got future starting possibilities
5331203 we really feel confident that hes ready to play in the nhl
5331204 dek is a little different in that he didnt play junior
5331205 hes a little older because he played college hockey but lets not write him off at all dek is a pro now and hes ready to be a pro i think hes a sleeper
5331206 i think murderklok brings up a very valid point games although the common consensus is that pc gaming is dead there are plenty of gamers out there who use pcs

5331212 no they do it in the way youve spent years learning turns out linux cant beam how to documents into your head either

5331216 linux doesnt need to screw up to require the command line it can sometimes crop up as the only way to install certain things

5331224 linux doesnt offer anything visible or pressing of value to those users that warrants the effort of switching to linux from windows
5331225 linux doesnt offer anything visible or pressing of value to those users
5331226 at the end of the day these people read noobs who represent the majority of users dont care what they use so long as it works and gets the job done for them
5331227 yeah thats no problem we just want it for email and web browsing
5331228 ignorance ask an average non computer illiterate what linux is and they probably couldnt answer this hampers adoption

5331274 a farmer went out to sow his seed as he was scattering the seed some fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil it sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow but when the sun came up the plants were scorched and they withered because they had no root other seed fell among thorns which grew up and choked the plants still other seed fell on good soil where it produced a crop a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown he who has ears let him hear
5331275 listen then to what the parable of the sower means when anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart this is the seed sown along the path the one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy but since he has no root he lasts only a short time when trouble or persecution comes because of the word he quickly falls away the one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it making it unfruitful but the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it he produces a crop yielding a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown
5331276 listen a farmer went out to sow his seed as he was scattering the seed some fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil it sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow but when the sun came up the plants were scorched and they withered because they had no root other seed fell among thorns which grew up and choked the plants so that they did not bear grain still other seed fell on good soil it came up grew and produced a crop multiplying thirty sixty or even a hundred times
5331277 dont you understand this parable how then will you understand any parable the farmer sows the word some people are like seed along the path where the word is sown as soon as they hear it satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them others like seed sown on rocky places hear the word and at once receive it with joy but since they have no root they last only a short time when trouble or persecution comes because of the word they quickly fall away still others like seed sown among thorns hear the word but the worries of this life the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word making it unfruitful others like seed sown on good soil hear the word accept it and produce a crop thirty sixty or even a hundred times what was sown
5331278 a farmer went out to sow his seed as he was scattering the seed some fell along the path it was trampled on and the birds of the air ate it up some fell on rock and when it came up the plants withered because they had no moisture other seed fell among thorns which grew up with it and choked the plants still other seed fell on good soil it came up and yielded a crop a hundred times more than was sown
5331279 this is the meaning of the parable the seed is the word of god
5331280 indeed when gentiles who do not have the law do by nature things required by the law they are a law for themselves even though they do not have the law since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts their consciences also bearing witness and their thoughts now accusing now even defending them this will take place on the day when god will judge mens secrets through jesus christ as my gospel declares
5331281 it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened who have tasted the heavenly gift who have shared in the holy spirit who have tasted the goodness of the word of god and the powers of the coming age if they fall away to be brought back to repentance because to their loss they are crucifying the son of god all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace

5331463 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5331464 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria

5331605 its going to be a fun walk down memory lane for all of us because weve all gone on to other lives
5331606 im excited about being back with everybody what has been so amazing is people have wanted to come back and participate
5331607 the hardest thing for me was i knew i wasnt going to be able to offer the paycheck that most of those guys make and so i just said im extending the invitation and just know that youre wanted and you do exactly what you need to do so i was really honored that they came
5331608 so doing this lead me on tour im not going to try to sound like im 27 im 47 and im happy to be 47 so when i open my mouth the sound you hear thats what this woman sounds like
5331609 when youre recording youre just hoping that someone will listen to it
5331610 at that point 20 years down the road seemed forever
5331611 i was pregnant with my first child matt and my grandmother had just died i was wrestling with facing some more adult issues ex husband gary chapman and i had been married five years which is long enough to have gone through some rough patches i had just realized that life cant be tied up in a neat bow and i wanted to reflect on that
5331612 i think i had done a lot of pompom waving up until that point because of my real love for jesus and my love of hearing songs that would build up peoples faith i remember back then just going you know life is really messy and theres a lot of heartache i was more interested in exploring the harder things in life
5331613 at that point i was so sick of being serious its funny how your pendulum goes back and forth but at that point in recording lead me on i was kind of tired of the pompom waving i was like hey life is tough buckle down grow up i just think the honesty on that record is compelling
5331614 he and i had not written together for eight years
5331615 the verses talk about how crazy christmas has become and the chorus is sort of our response to that its so commercialized but i need a silent night i like the message
5331616 vince was kind of messing around with those chords and it just sounded romantic we wrote that over a cup of coffee one morning
5331617 i dont think anybody really thinks about christmas eve as being the most romantic time especially if you have children because you are exhausted but if you could have a very romantic christmas eve what would it be like we tried to write a song that would bring that to life we wrote this together and were both on it on the recording but hes not singing im singing and hes playing guitar
5331618 we work so well together we have a lot of respect for each other weve been friends since i was 14 maybe 15 i think its rare to have so many great creative memories with somebody
5331619 ive got a dozen songs that im ready to record and i hope to be back in the studio and get at least a few of them recorded before i do this lead me on tour
5331620 theres a song i wrote about vince and theres a song that a friend and i wrote when she found her birth mom always songs inspired by people in my life
5331621 there is a song that i wrote on the airplane flying out to the acms academy of country music awards in las vegas
5331622 i had come from the cemetery watching my son and his friends bury one of their classmates and that song is called shovel in hand
5331623 as far as how everything sounds right now they all sound like campfire songs because im playing them
5331624 when you just sit down and play something with a guitar they all sound the same but im looking forward to being with some amazing musicians and saying lets try this up tempo song as a ballad and this ballad as an up tempo song all that creative process i really look forward to it
5331625 im just going to continue doing what ive always done and the pieces will just fall where theyll fall im so much more interested in making the music than i am promoting it
5331626 i dont know what tomorrow holds but i feel like im getting better at living in the day instead of living in the past and trying to anticipate tomorrow from a songwriting standpoint i hope my best songwriting is in the future

5331677 i know of no time when he spoke out against the chicago gun ban
5331678 if you can ratchet back the firepower then you really can do something about the level of violence in urban areas
5331679 the best thing the senate could do is give out more money for more cops
5331680 john mccain voted against these fiscally reckless proposals because americans should expect that their government can fund law enforcement priorities by eliminating the billions in wasteful spending that occurs every year not by further increasing the tax burden on american families
5331681 neither of them have a plan to reduce urban crime
5331682 weve stuck with the teams motto we run to the ball a lot of effort give 100 percent every play with the upperclassmen preaching that and helping us out a lot i think we are a great group of linebackers were just going to maintain what we do
5331683 its fast really fast the key is you have to be conditioned on every play the offense is going 100 percent if you dont go 100 percent youre going to lose
5331684 someone that has helped us out with that is strength coach mike barwis we conditioned harder than i have in my life and it helps us a lot it helps us be prepared for the offense
5331685 im at the sam i actually like the sam its nice there are a lot of upperclassmen at that spot we have senior austin panter redshirt freshman walk on kevin leach and redshirt freshman brandon herron at that spot but coach jay hopson is moving guys around a lot
5331686 its competition but at the same time its all love those guys are helping me out just like they are with everybody else austin if i come off the field and didnt do something right hell correct me say that was good but next time do this and youll make the play easier better whatever
5331687 our objective is to work together with russia but thats got to be based on russia respecting the independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours and not using its military force to impose its will on those countries
5331688 we are not seeking to freeze or break off the nrc but neither can we have business as usual with russian forces on the ground
5331689 the only means to stabilize the region and bring security to ordinary people
5331690 making reference to the bucharest nato declaration which clearly stresses that georgia and ukraine will be nato members we ask the nato leaders to instruct their ministers of foreign affairs to consider granting nato membership action plan map to georgia and ukraine as soon as possible
5331691 we support offering a map to georgia as soon as possible
5331692 citrix resellers determine the price at which they sell to their customers based on their purchase price from distributors their business model and the overall scope of each solution
5331693 the increase is a result of the rising costs of doing business globally based upon the inflation of various currencies in comparison to the u s dollar upon which citrix pricing is based
5331694 now beauty is in the eye of the beholder beauty can be a good set of teeth beauty is nice wavy hair beauty can be blue eyes or green eyes
5331695 there is such a thing as disposition temperament manners general attractiveness attitude and demeanour all those things tend to make a person attractive

5331703 si van a estar al lado del consell para reclamar a zapatero que reconozca el mill n de personas m s que viven en la comunitat y para reivindicar la falta de inversiones de agentes de jueces y de financiaci n sanitaria
5331704 frente a la insuficiente inversi n por parte del gobierno socialista el consell ha movilizado m s de 2 000 millones de euros en los ltimos cinco a os destinados a infraestructuras como centros de salud hospitales colegios institutos y universidades
5331705 la mayor inversi n en carreteras de la historia de la comunitat para incrementar la vertebraci n territorial
5331706 ha invertido como ninguna otra en infraestructuras viarias y transporte p blico en toda la comunitat
5331707 en la pasada legislatura la generalitat invirti en carreteras 690 millones de euros y en lo que llevamos de la presente hay en marcha inversiones por importe de 1 620 millones de euros
5331708 los accesos a las principales capitales tur sticas se colapsan
5331709 frente a la inacci n de zapatero en las carreteras nacionales el consell act a en las v as que son de su competencia

5331713 after an hour on that flash game all i get is
5331714 each slip covered 3 panel hardcover kit holds a uv flashlight and the instructions steps 1 use this flashlight to reveal hidden text 2 deny you ever used this flashlight across all three panels no other words or images are visible except under black light at which point photographs of the lead actor and supporting actress a list of six potential drama series emmy nominations and four press blurbs come into view also tucked into a slot are 4 dvds with this seasons 12 episodes plus written synopses
5331715 we feel like were playing very well right now but you have to keep in mind its single elimination
5331716 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war
5331717 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war has missed more votes in the senate than a man who suffered a brain hemorrage is outrageous
5331718 do you think that labour are trying to wreck the uk so any other party that comes into power will find it self in a complete mess
5331719 first we narrowed the gap between players point totals at the reset going into the playoffs
5331720 rich beem who started as the 134 seed finished seventh at the barclays and only moved up to 113th under the revised structure he would have moved up to 68th vijay singh started as the no 2 seed but missed the cut at the barclays he dropped to sixth but would have dropped to 23rd under the revised structure at 23rd he would be in danger of missing the tour championship especially if he missed another cut camilo villegas started as the 52nd seed and finished 21st at the barclays ninth at deutsche bank and seventh at bmw moving up to 28th going into the tour championship under the new system he would have been 14th going into the tour championship
5331721 i knew i had to play my butt off just to make it up there
5331722 i didnt want to have four weeks off and im glad i at least got into the first one ive got a chance for the first one and the second one so on and so forth im there now
5331723 i just kept telling myself i could do it and it was an unbelievable feeling today
5331724 we were going down the second fairway and my caddie mark long said lets say you are four behind
5331725 we were trying to make it as if we were behind all day dont protect anything and fire at the flags
5331726 it means a lot to me four years ago today i ran my first cup race for jack roush and he took a giant gamble on me i felt like at the time
5331727 jack won the race that day i believe greg biffle won it and we finished 10th and all five of the cars were in the top 10 and to be a part of that again today for ford motor company for roush and for all the guys its an honor
5331728 we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys today
5331729 we were good there on that one run on that one set of tires and then that was pretty much all we had so to come out of here with that were happy with that at least weve got something to build on
5331730 it definitely wouldve been great to win but you dont want to take unnecessary risks and take out a top 5 finish and finish 20th or something
5331731 i just drove as hard as i could and tried not to make any mistakes at this point in the season a third place is great but a win wouldve been better but a 20th wouldve been just about devastating for us trying to make the chase
5331732 we can just drive as hard as we can do anything we possibly can and just go all out and thats all we can do and well see where we end up
5331733 quiero la medalla pero estar satisfecho si rindo al m ximo

5331737 wants to be an ally of governor omalleys in washington
5331738 kratovil wants to represent omalleys values in washington andy harris wants to represent the values of the first district
5331739 these liberals are supporting frank kratovil because they know when he gets to washington he will vote with the liberal washington leadership to raise taxes increase wasteful spending and ban off shore drilling which would alleviate our dependence on foreign oil
5331740 if andy harris is this worked up over a fundraiser taking place less than 10 miles from his own front door then he must be apoplectic when he looks at his own fundraising reports
5331741 unlike frank kratovil who is proud to be drawing his financial support from democrats and republicans alike right here in maryland andy harris has already received over one million dollars of financial support from a single out of state special interest group
5331742 i am happy being comptroller my own mother didnt think i was going to win in 2006 frankly it was an upset victory im extremely happy being comptroller and im extremely happy being comptroller and i have no interest running for higher office

5331759 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
5331760 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
5331761 the only thing i really thought and its a horrible thing hopefully they didnt feel any pain because if they did man this is really really bad
5331762 im very sad i pray they didnt suffer its very tough

5331773 just because youre on their side doesnt mean theyre on your side
5331774 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to
5331775 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5331776 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are uphappy with their lot
5331777 like web oriented news consumers integrators are affluent and highly educated however they are older on average than those who consider the internet their main source of news
5331778 if you want blu ray go get blu ray this product is meant to improve playback of dvds
5331779 i think the financial problem is halfway through the cycle
5331780 theres another shoe to drop ahead of us and it could be more severe
5331781 is up to about 50 billion and will probably top 100 billion before its over
5331782 those firms merrill wachovia and others are going to have to raise that cash
5331783 they are either going to have to get it from the federal reserve through some direct or indirect means which means more leverage more fed balance sheet more regularly oversight or theyre going to have to get it in the capital markets
5331784 but a thousand banks is going to be a lot
5331785 each dollar of bank equity that gets lost takes out about 12 or 13 dollars of loans so theres a tremendous magnifier effect of small changes in bank equity
5331786 we will likely see more insolvencies among small u s regional banks that have focused on mortgage business
5331787 were it not for government aid and backing they would have already had to declare bankruptcy their portfolios have problems
5331788 you see one brick at a time in the financial problem area become addressed
5331789 it was very surprising that these subjects would still have cells floating in their blood so long afterward
5331790 the antibodies that we isolated are remarkable antibodies they grab onto the virus very tightly and they virtually never fall off
5331791 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5331792 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5331793 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5331794 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5331795 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5331796 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5331797 if so should we ignore it negotiate with it contain it or defeat it
5331798 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5331799 it never grows old i was literally born with a doubles partner she never minds if i miss a shot or two
5331800 i dont know anyone who would get tired of playing with venus williams
5331801 we just try to win in every event we can
5331802 i see it a little differently i see that serena has two gold medals
5331803 by providing information on the population and the environment and appropriate contraception for everyone doctors should help to bring family size into the arena of environmental ethics analogous to avoiding patio heaters and high carbon cars
5331804 id love to have another baby darling but think of its carbon footprint
5331805 please consider the environment before having sex with your spouse
5331806 i want a baby that looks like you i want a baby that looks like me well we could fit a little one in that looks like your father and now i want one that looks like beyonc
5331807 if i have a large number of children one of them may still love me when he grows up
5331808 eden continues her quest to discover whether or not she is into women

5331812 if too human does what we expect it will in the marketplace then it can change the world for st catharines and niagara
5331813 i get the question a lot now how do i feel now that the game is going to be released
5331814 and the truth is i dont know when you make a video game you work so hard and so long that right now it is sort of surreal
5331815 the first is just action if you just want to play for that you can the second is the conflict between man and machine which is a classic science fiction theme
5331816 the third asks the question what it means to be human how much would you lose if you continue to alter yourself how far could you go before you werent human anymore
5331817 be careful when you fight the monsters lest you become one
5331818 when movies first arrived they were just for the spectacle they were short films showing firemen fighting a fire that sort of thing
5331819 but eventually the medium matured and filmmakers wanted to tackle more serious stories gaming is very much like that its a medium and an industry that is maturing
5331820 ive said this before i want to see a campus here in niagara dedicated to interactive information technology
5331821 obviously silicon knights is one of our founding partners and were very excited to be associated with them
5331822 we have ontarios biggest video game producer in our backyard and we should take advantage of that
5331823 teams that are going to play in the finals watch out
5331824 today was a real reality check it was probably the biggest game we have had for seven years this footy club and we got comprehensively beaten especially at the contested footy full credit to them i think they are going to be a big problem for teams in september
5331825 they have got a lot of talent are very mature very slick and probably had four of their best six players sitting on the sidelines on saturday night and they will probably come back in next week
5331826 but again well recover front up and send them out there and have a shot at it

5331838 tyrants and oppressors leave our kashmir as they marched past police barricades near the un military observer group in india and pakistan unmogip office in the summer capital srinagar
5331839 no solution to the kashmir issue other than merger with pakistan
5331840 we are pakistanis and pakistan is us because we are tied with the country through islam
5331841 do you have faith in my leadership i will be faithful to you till my death and will carry everyone along
5331842 we ask india to start a dialogue over kashmir open the srinagar muzaffarabad road for trade and release all kashmiris in indian jails
5331843 we will free both kashmirs was maliks slogan as the crowd also cheered him

5331848 we exploited the long tail because we had no choice
5331849 now weve looked to other ways to serve the tail
5331850 we acquired the rights to platforms that dont yet exist
5331851 we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy
5331852 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money in the end we can and should be judged on the fairness of our coverage but that is a judgment that must be made over the course of the whole campaign not a single period of time
5331853 what were seeing here is the potential for a reshaping of the retail landscape in america

5331860 people are beginning to wonder whether russia can be trusted
5331861 its a recession when your neighbor loses his job its a depression when you lose yours
5331862 wallace collins has previously received 4 000 in donations from this secretive organization that took money from injured workers without their knowledge
5331863 collins has used this money for his own political purposes and should return that money at once
5331864 all candidates and those who had received funds from the working oklahomans alliance
5331865 well if were going to ask wallace collins to give back that money then we should ask all of them
5331866 because everyone who got that money should give it back
5331867 i doubt very seriously if any of these candidates or elected officials knew where that money came from
5331868 in campaigns you dont look gift horses in the mouth
5331869 i havent seen any proof that theyve done anything wrong or illegal
5331870 and i would certainly want to see proof of wrongdoing if thats what happened if mr warren can prove theyve done something illegal then id certainly like to know but just because he doesnt agree with them that doesnt mean theyve done anything illegal
5331871 they are registered with the state ethics commission so i dont know how that makes them secretive
5331872 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5331873 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
5331874 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5331875 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
5331876 well you guys did it so we get to do it
5331877 how little of their canned boring propaganda can i get away with carrying live
5331878 resolution 1701 says clearly no arms south of the litani river no militias south of the litani that is why unifil is here
5331879 is the unifil mandate to coordinate with hizballah or to kick hizballah out south of the litani
5331880 the cry for change in america is louder than the cry for mercy we need mercy not change
5331881 its easy to point fingers and blame people in this place but the problems that this country has are with us who claim we know the lord but have not lived it and not been as faithful
5331882 so repentance and revival cannot start in the building behind me until it starts in the temple inside me
5331883 we think answers for the nations ills will be in the next election we know that ultimately unless we are faithful unless we oh god have lived a life that pleases you its hardly appropriate that we would expect others to please you
5331884 i am so moved today i see a young generation coming that wants god more than pornography wants god more than food wants god more than fame
5331885 russias attack on georgia is a disheartening reminder that the 21st century remains a primitive age of fanatical nationalism and military bullying
5331886 even more distressing is the fact that both russia and georgia are christian nations with ancient church roots
5331887 military intervention in georgia like all actions born of hatred or callous self interest is an act of madness a senseless rejection of gods love and salvation
5331888 political leaders in russia and georgia indeed in many other nations including our own seek to justify military interventions on the grounds of national interest or public security
5331889 in general the churches of christ reject such puerile political rationalizations
5331890 brutality in georgia is part of a world wide trend
5331891 that our country will learn the ways of peace and restore its reputation as a credible witness for restraint and nonviolence
5331892 war may at times be a necessary evil but it is inherently evil
5331893 christians must never identify violence against others with the will of god or countenance such rhetoric when used by their governments
5331894 gods purpose is shalom we do not go to war in the name of god
5331895 the use of force in the dispute over south ossetia and abkhazia has cost the precious lives of civilians and soldiers risks destabilizing a fragile region and reawakens deep fears there and far beyond
5331896 military forces to return to positions held before the current violence
5331897 authorities who resorted to the use of force are to be held accountable for the loss of life they have caused the well being of people who have fled their homes and of those whose homes have been destroyed must be a high priority in the coming days
5331898 the united nations must ensure the territorial integrity and political independence of georgia in accordance with the un charter and by collective action of the un security council
5331899 on the night of 8 august 2008 sorrow death and destruction came down upon the earth
5331900 we saw numerous innocent civilian victims we saw the destruction of populated areas and the infrastructure of south ossetia stop this immediately do not spill any more blood do not enlarge the present conflict
5331901 god and the holy virgin to stop the bloodshed so that our country as well as ossetia georgia the caucasus and the entire world could enjoy peace and prosperity
5331902 we are facing very serious peril but dont be afraid of anything god is with us and virgin mary is protecting is but one thing concerns us very deeply is that orthodox russians are bombing orthodox georgians
5331903 this is unprecedented act of relations between our countries reinforce your prayer and god will save georgia there is a saying water will flow up and down and will return to its weir so believe that god will not separate georgia into pieces
5331904 i have told representatives of the russian authorities several times that separatism is like a transmittable disease and everyone should remember this including russia
5331905 we have once again experienced care of georgia never ending humiliation insults slander terrorist acts and gunfire at civilians
5331906 georgia has shown such love and care for our people for the past 18 years
5331907 give full backing to those who protect their homes children wives parents and friends and to serve the people and the fatherland with any possible talents and capabilities
5331908 940 patents the filing of a lawsuit against juniper networks in august 2007 claiming infringement of graphon patents which protect graphon
5331909 940 patents and the applications that resulted in the 591 patents as part of its acquisition of network engineering software inc
5331910 the number of patents now owned by graphon as a result of the nes acquisition has increased to twenty three a number that is expected to continue to increase as patent applications on file at the u s patent and trademark office mature into issued patents
5331911 aggressively protecting the technology represented in these patents is an important part of maximizing their value to graphon
5331912 scenarios and solutions mapping the traps and sales effectiveness gaps

5331927 i had a slightly disappointing race in the 50m but the girls propped me up and helped me have fun before the race and that really really helped us
5331928 its been an amazing week for me such an emotional journey these whole nine days whether its a huge high or a disappointment its hard but its so worth it even when it can get challenging at times
5331929 i had too many nerves in the 100m but i handled it today mostly because of the other girls
5331930 they were having fun and that relaxed me a bit more and i did a really good time for myself this is definitely the biggest high of any meet i have ever done

5331955 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

5331959 our group has been working on understanding heparin biosynthesis for almost 30 years
5331960 we are working on what might be the next generation of heparin production with no animal source
5331961 we treat it to reduce the molecular size then subject it to enzymatic steps to convert it to heparin
5331962 we use recombinant enzymes that are part of the natural pathway for heparin synthesis
5331963 we are now working with one liter amounts there are million liter fermenters we have to scale up three orders of magnitude which is pretty daunting but not impossible
5331964 we have talked to a number of them they all are interested in the approach but want to wait
5331965 but those drugs are a thousand times more expensive than heparin also they are not as good as heparin it has multiple activities many of which benefit patients those drugs are very specific they work well only for a small number of applications
5331966 we believe that the heparin market is here to stay
5331967 if you ever have any slight discoloration please go to your dermatologist or your doctor and get it checked out as soon as possible
5331968 youll want to do it monthly less frequent ly and youll forget to do it
5331969 have a good mirror or a good friend or partner able to check your back
5331970 look for any skin blemish that is not normal for you
5331971 use your first three fingers and go in a circular motion from the nipple around it doesnt matter how you do it just be consistent
5331972 you can also do up and down and up and down then look in the mirror sometimes the nipple might retract or you could see dimpling theres one cancer inflammatory breast cancer that can show up like a rash check under armpits with the pads of your fingers for lymph checks
5331973 thats an uncomfortable thing to do those self exams youre just starting to know your body but a good place is the shower and probably monthly to make the habit pain is rarely a symptom its usually just a lump
5331974 unless we view screening in the context of prevention and diet and exercise then the screening opens a conversation when screening results are viewed in context of the big picture its more helpful
5331975 see a doctor for blood testing so youll get ideas about what to do with the results
5331976 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities

5331999 it was a minor affair by road maintenance standards a job that cost 15 000 at most a spokesman for the virginia department of transportation said but the work reignited a dispute over the winding country road that three years ago pitted neighbor against neighbor and became a symbol of the contentious debate over growth in loudoun county
5332000 mike p salmon a vdot spokesman said last weeks work was necessary to fix a drainage problem but some residents are saying that its too soon to send crews back to the short section of mount gilead that was paved in 2005 after a bitter fight before the loudoun board of supervisors the paving was proposed in 2004 by two mount gilead residents who said the rutted gravel road posed a safety hazard the proposal was criticized by several of their neighbors who said that the danger was exaggerated and that a smoother surface would ruin the roads country feel and hasten development
5332001 the board sided with those who favored paving but agreed to limit it to a short stretch where a majority of residents had said they supported it so using a portion of loudouns transportation allocation vdot paved less than a mile of the four mile road

5332003 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5332004 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5332005 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5332006 platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
5332007 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
5332008 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
5332009 flexibility in caste determination is essential as it allows the colony to respond to changes in need or environmental fluctuations
5332010 differences in the nutrition that an individual assimilated during larval growth are strong predictors of caste
5332011 but there are still haves and have nots in the colony those genetic variants who have a reproductive advantage and those that dont

5332088 the fact is that although we have a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years abortions have not gone down
5332089 politicians from hillary clinton and john kerry to howard dean have recently contended that abortions have increased since george w bush took office in 2001
5332090 this claim is false its based on an opinion piece that used data from only 16 states a study by the alan guttmacher institute of 43 states found that abortions have actually decreased
5332091 the claim is repeated by supporters of abortion rights as evidence that bushs anti abortion policies have backfired or at least been ineffective
5332092 but the claim is untrue in fact according to the respected alan guttmacher institute a 20 year decline in abortion rates continued after bush took office
5332093 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5332094 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5332095 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5332096 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5332097 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5332098 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5332099 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military

5332102 i did have a relationship with miss lewinsky that was not appropriate
5332103 in fact it was wrong it constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which i am solely and completely responsible
5332104 i know that my public comments and my silence about this matter gave a false impression
5332105 i misled people including even my wife i deeply regret that
5332106 i intend to reclaim my family life for my family
5332107 its nobodys business but ours even presidents have private lives it is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into private lives and get on with our national life

5332111 i have never had sexual relations with monica lewinsky ive never had an affair with her
5332112 there is not a sexual relationship an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship
5332113 im going to say this again i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky
5332114 i can only tell you i was motivated by many factors
5332115 first by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct i was also very concerned about protecting my family the fact that these questions were being asked in a politically inspired lawsuit which has since been dismissed was a consideration too
5332116 our country has been distracted by this matter for too long and i take my responsibility for my part in all of this
5332117 that is all i can do now is the time in fact it is past time to move on and so tonight i ask you to turn away from the spectacle of the past seven months to repair the fabric of our national discourse and to return our attention to all the challenges and all the promise of the next american century

5332287 in the near future i would love to have a talk about new challenges and opportunities in education and training and the provision of safe and fair workplaces in nsw
5332288 it could be the type of person attracted to farming are those that want to work in isolation theyre introverted a whole heap of things that might be correlated with depression so theyre vulnerable
5332289 we could also hypothesise that theres less help seeking services in rural areas

5332296 the ibm xiv storage system 2810 a14 provides the hardware platform required for the ibm xiv storage system software
5332297 make no mistake open access to this unused bandwidth would surely be good for our own bottom line not to mention those of many of our industry peers
5332298 better access to the internet means more people doing web searches and using our software products but we think the public interest here is paramount and just as clear opening up the vast unused portion of spectrum will enable a new generation of innovation and competition from which consumers especially those to whom the white spaces could soon deliver high speed online access should benefit tremendously both from a wealth of new products and services and from far lower cell phone and internet access bills
5332299 a once in a lifetime opportunity to provide ubiquitous wireless broadband access to all americans
5332300 coupled with the android open source platform for mobile consumer devices tv white spaces can provide uniquely low cost mobile broadband coverage for all americans as announced last fall over thirty other companies are working with google through the open handset alliance to develop a fully open source software stack including the operating system middleware and user applications android powered handsets should begin appearing commercially later this year and would be an excellent match for the tv white space
5332301 conclusively show that spectrum sensing white space devices will cause harmful interference to wireless microphones during live events
5332302 nab has no quarrel with field tests but based upon multiple failures of unlicensed devices in laboratory testing thus far we remain highly skeptical that this technology will ever work as advertised
5332303 the babies have actually made me more ambitious i feel all this newfound inspiration
5332304 ive always loved sports i used to be on a track team in school and thats probably why i can think to myself now yeah i can do this which is totally crazy the team was a big part of my life back then and taught me so many things when i look back on my life and what im able to do its partly because of that early training it taught me discipline how to be committed about striving to win stamina all that good stuff

5332307 this is the first song on tales of the crown called higher and it s not a fast one everybody expects the fastest track on my records to be the first haha but not this time also the album has no intro except from a few notes at the beginning of higher i really like this song with a mighty guitar riff and a melodic chorus a typical strong arpish sounding tune have fun
5332308 our fans will get just the kind of songs they have come to know and expect from me and my band
5332309 but dont worry these modern approaches are only gradual and dont affect the typical flair of my songs

5332315 the allies will reiterate full support for the territorial integrity of georgia
5332316 the foreign ministers will also probably send a message of solidarity and will agree on a package of measures
5332317 including the international mechanism to monitor respect of the engagements taken by both sides
5332318 we are going to help rebuild georgia into a strong georgian state
5332319 the russians will have failed in their effort to undermine georgia and we will be looking at what we can do with the states around that region as well
5332320 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5332321 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5332322 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5332323 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves

5332335 two women came in and said weve got to get rid of this drongo i said id be happy to help
5332336 the town is desperately short of women we just havent got women here hes highlighted the problem and the way hes said it hes got national publicity
5332337 hes just letting people know its good fun to be a woman in mount isa if hes got to take a few brickbats on the head that wont bother molony
5332338 we are all rednecks up here we dont carry it around as a badge of shame we carry it around as a badge of honour
5332339 id suggest cr molony go off to school somewhere and get educated about what responsibility he holds on behalf of the community etiquette school perhaps
5332340 what do these sorts of statements say about our community its horrifying that in this day and age a public figure would say such things what era is he living in
5332341 but hes correct in saying there is a gender imbalance there are a lot of young men in town who would love to have families and would love to have a partner

5332348 we are grateful to our talented staff who have helped the company meet recent milestones
5332349 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
5332350 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
5332351 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
5332352 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
5332353 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders

5332609 isto pra tu aprender a n o largar o purgat rio seu escroto
5332610 o ensino da hist ria universal nas chamadas escolas m dias ainda hoje muito deixa a desejar poucos professores compreendem que a finalidade do ensino da hist ria n o deve consistir em aprender de cor datas e acontecimentos ou obrigar o aluno a saber quando esta ou aquela batalha se realizou quando nasceu um general ou quando um monarca quase sempre sem significa o p s sobre a cabe a a coroa dos seus av s n o gra as a deus n o disso que se deve tratar aprender hist ria quer dizer procurar e encontrar as for as que conduzem s causas das a es que vemos como acontecimentos hist ricos

5332621 acho que j te contei sobre aquele velhinho maluco que conheci em paris n o contei n o ent o escuta eu tava fazendo mestrado na sorbonne e certo dia chamaram meu orientador pra ajudar na identifica o de um velho italiano que fora preso sem portar qualquer documento o maluco foi flagrado tentando quebrar no museu do louvre o vidro que protege a mona lisa provido de f sforos e de um tubo de desodorante cheio de querosene ele pretendia queim la gritava em italiano algo do tipo n o era pra ela viver tudo isto bom voc poderia perguntar e o que um professor de f sica tem a ver com essa hist ria vou te dizer o dr jean louis meu orientador era o maior especialista em relatividade geral e restrita e ao mesmo tempo em qu ntica sendo um grande defensor duma teoria unificada a pol cia por mera curiosidade queria que ele checasse as teorias estapaf rdias do velho louco que dizia ser o pr prio leonardo da vinci fomos juntos eu e meu professor como n o conseguimos ler os manuscritos do velho que insistia em escrever de tr s pra frente com as letras ao contr rio resolvemos interrog lo com a ajuda dum int rprete do que que voc s est o rindo
5332622 s t contando o que aconteceu n o t inventando nada
5332623 a nica a inventar algo foi a mente insana do italiano
5332624 se ou n o simples pira o depende de v rios fatores isso relativo agora vai continua
5332625 bom o leonardo da s culo vinte como o apelidamos nos mostrou uns rascunhos esquisitos dum engenho que supostamente o ajudaria a penetrar e sair dum buraco negro rotacional no tempo e lugar que quisesse voc s sabem que meu doutorado hoje uma tentativa de desmistificar esses falsos autores que a gente v por a seja de auto ajuda ou misticismos similares que usam e abusam de conceitos e teorias da f sica moderna pra defender uma id ia imbecil qualquer n o entendem nada e abusam da ignor ncia equivalente do p blico pra bombarde lo com bobagens aquele pseudo leonardo era um exemplo t pico n o passava dum hippie que ap s derreter o c rebro com todas as drogas poss veis tentava protestar contra a massifica o das obras de arte as quais segundo ele j n o s o compreendidas por 99 das pessoas a come ar pelos pr prios estudiosos do assunto ele dizia que preferiria queimar a mona lisa encarem como uma performance dizia a v la enfeitando atrav s duma tosca reprodu o a geladeira duma dona de casa norte americana meu quadro n o ping im conclu a ele

5332631 olha n o me lembro bem disso mas acho que tu viu o mesmo que eu
5332632 wir haben ein gutes spiel gesehen auch wenn noch nicht alles rund lief
5332633 deutschland kann f r sich die h chsten wasserpreise beanspruchen in den usa ist wasser am billigsten
5332634 da die wasserpreise von den gemeinden festgelegt werden dienen die hohen preise zur subventionierung rtlicher projekte die sonst mit steuergeldern bezahlt werden m ssten
5332635 herselfve got this feature that spirit prefigure my lone art schools in connection with fucking the people extra
5332636 to share best practices and suggestions on fostering corporate responsibility
5332637 sustainability has always been important to fairchild but it is becoming even more important as we try to do our part in reducing our climate impact and our consumption of energy and water
5332638 the key difference between larrabee and other graphics processor units is that each core is a complete x86 architecture core that supports interblock communications via a ring bus
5332639 we went back to the custom pipeline approach to make the architecture software friendly for developers
5332640 larrabee can execute 16 floating operations per clock extensions and combines the best in cpu programmability and gpu parallelism
5332641 intel claims that the x86 base of larrabee makes it seamless for developers but there are several important questions to be answered will applications written for todays intel cpus run unmodified on larrabee and applications written for larrabee run unmodified on todays intel multicore cpus
5332642 today just the main hardware and software are worth 60 billion
5332643 thats a mind boggling average growth rate of 16 5 percent for 27 years
5332644 we think intel will probably not exit the flash business as this business eats up n 1 and n 2 process technology capacity
5332645 what will intel do with all its 90nm and 65nm capacity if it exits all flash memory operations the firm will still have the depreciation associated with that equipment whether it makes flash memory or not
5332646 in fact the whole reason intel entered these businesses to begin with was so that flash memory could serve as a fab filler further management may think hope or wish that solid state drives will come and save the day with respect to flash pricing we think this is also an unlikely scenario given the enormous supply of memory capacity that samsung continues to ramp
5332647 in my opinion we must take a proactive and reasonable approach to this issue one that positively affects all aspects of our community
5332648 wir haben eine gute generation bei den 18 bis 20 j hrigen von denen ich mir sehr viel verspreche
5332649 a problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer

5332652 pois afinal voc s querem eleger como seu reitor um pe o de obra um figura que nem sequer tem o segundo grau ou um cientista maluco cuja concep o de ser humano semelhante id ia que tem do funcionamento de um computador hem

5332715 en el congreso la derecha tiene mayor a la candidatura de lugo cont con el respaldo del partido liberal radical aut ntico plra de ideolog a de derecha y representante de terratenientes
5332716 ellos van a defender sus intereses y no van a aceptar ninguna ocupaci n de tierras ni reducci n de los latifundios
5332717 lugo est en una posici n m s de izquierda ya sali a decir que cree que las ocupaciones de tierras son leg timas como ltima instancia en la negociaci n pol tica y respalda la lucha de los campesinos por una reforma agraria integral sin embargo creemos que se va a encontrar con muchas contradicciones va a tener que asumir algunos acuerdos con la burgues a por ello el movimiento social se est preparando para apoyar las posiciones del presidente lugo y llegado el momento presionar para que se concreten los cambios
5332718 ni bien gan lugo los compa eros se organizaron y empezaron a ocupar tierras especialmente en el norte del pa s donde hay una zona muy conflictiva y donde el movimiento campesino est m s organizado e ideologizado
5332719 el an lisis realizado por nuestro movimiento es que este no es un momento estrat gico para presionar no se puede presionar al gobierno saliente que no va ofrecer garant as ni soluciones y tampoco al entrante al que hay que darle un poco de tiempo para ver si efectivamente cumple con lo que ha prometido
5332720 creo si que los compa eros en el interior est n preparados para ocupar como una medida de fuerza que me parece correcto y creo que el movimiento campesino est lo suficientemente maduro pol ticamente para tratar primero de agotar las instancias institucionales para despu s en caso de que no se cumpla con lo prometido comenzar a presionar
5332721 tambi n hay una presi n sobre todo de los medios de comunicaci n para crear en la opini n p blica una opini n desfavorable al gobierno de lugo creando temor y miedo
5332722 cuando el gobierno act e tocando intereses pol ticos fuertes la oposici n e incluso el partido liberal integrante de la coalici n de gobierno va a presionar para defender sus privilegios van a tratar de desestabilizar sectores para defender esos privilegios
5332723 y es b sicamente por eso que creo que mucho del peso pol tico que va a tener lugo depender de si puede llevar a cabo una reforma agraria integral
5332724 hay casi un mill n de empleados p blicos una clase media que vive directa o indirectamente de los recursos del estado
5332725 esas estructuras represivas siguen existiendo y lamentablemente ser dificil romperlas hoy d a los compa eros siguen siendo torturados en las c rceles del interior siguen siendo secuestrados por la polic a est n presos en situaci n ilegal siendo ocurriendo asesinatos pol ticos el a o pasado nos asesinaron a un compa ero y en lo que va de este a o han asesinados otros dos compa eros del movimiento y esto en un marco de democracia de elecciones y de libertad de expresi n
5332726 por sobre todo la acci n del nuevo gobierno estar focalizada en que los ministerios sean eficaces en sus gesti n que la salud la educaci n funcionen hay que recordar que en 61 a os en el poder el partido colorado ha creado una maquinaria impresionante de asistencial smo usando los recursos del estado en su beneficio y distribuyendo empleos p blicos y van a defender sus privilegios
5332727 espero que ojala se cumpla con lograr que los servicios del estado funcionen debidamente eso ser a un buen primer paso
5332728 en los ltimos a os el movimiento social se ha fortalecido ha logrado parar las privatizaciones la ley antiterrorista y fundamentalmente es el movimiento campesino el que m s capacidad de movilizaci n tiene creo que los compa eros del movimiento social est n conscientes de la necesidad de defender la institucionalidad en este momento
5332729 se logr acumular bastante fuerza y constituirse en el movimiento que present y apoy la candidatura de fernando lugo despu s en el trabajo se lograron acordar algunos proyectos program ticos lamentablemente en las discusiones program ticas en la coalici n fueron mimetizadas
5332730 ahora el gran desaf o es hacer un buen trabajo en los ministerios lograr una buena gesti n pero sin negligenciar el movimiento social de base que dio apoyo y crecimiento a todo esto
5332731 tomaron distancia del movimiento social concentr ndose sus cuadros en ocupar los lugares del gobierno y eso no permiti que el propio partido se dinamice
5332732 el gran desaf o seguir creciendo con la base seguir formando y construyendo el poder popular que es lo nico que nos va a garantizar un movimiento social ideologizado que nos va a permitir en el futuro y creo que es v lido para toda am rica latina poner freno a pol ticas neoliberales capitalistas para mi la nica forma concretar un cambio social estructural es constuyendo el poder popular
5332733 eres la l rica bandera cuando en rondas galponeras un payador misionero en un sapucay de guerrero te evoca de mil maneras
5332734 era necesario quedar bien con el auspiciador y mostrar la camiseta la noche antes lo conversamos junto a mi compa ero y al boliviano y quedamos en eso un chileno se escapar a para mostrarse y el otro buscar a terminar la carrera
5332735 esta ha sido una negociaci n entre dos aliados y amigos cercanos y a pesar de que han habido altibajos naturalmente a lo largo de todo el proceso nos gratifica que ambas delegaciones hayan tratado esto en el esp ritu de intentar hacer algo que es importante para la seguridad de ambos pa ses y como aliados y amigos
5332736 lo que suceda en los pr ximos d as y meses determinar el futuro de las relaciones entre estados unidos y rusia pero del mismo modo mi opini n personal es que tienen que haber consecuencias para las acciones que rusia ha tomado contra un estado soberano
5332737 acuso al gobierno ruso de adoptar una pol tica de limpieza tnica y puedo probarlo con organizaciones internacionales que ya est n dando testimonio de lo que digo y recibimos 1 400 denuncias de ataques brutales asesinatos violaciones e internaci n de personas en violaci n de la convenci n de ginebra y del derecho humanitario internacional
5332738 como ya he dicho de acuerdo con el c digo de las naciones unidas estamos intentando imponer la paz a georgia que empez la agresi n consideramos que esta t ctica es muy efectiva y es la nica posible perm tanme recordarles que en la historia hemos visto muchos ejemplos de pacificaci n del agresor de esta manera los pa ses occidentales lo hicieron hace 70 a os y conocen las tr gicas consecuencias de eso quiero decir la lecci n del tratado de munich de 1938
5332739 rusia invadi un estado vecino soberano y amenaza a un gobierno democr tico electo por su pueblo
5332740 entendemos que el actual liderazgo de georgia es un proyecto especial de estados unidos pero un d a estados unidos tendr que elegir entre defender su prestigio por sobre un proyecto o una sociedad real que requiera acciones conjuntas
5332741 quiero dialogar con los rusos quiero que se retiren del territorio georgiano lo m s r pido posible y me interesa mantener buenas relaciones con rusia pero en el siglo xxi las naciones no invaden otras naciones
5332742 estamos sumamente decepcionados este informe aparentemente consiente el uso de la fuerza letal en una situaci n en la que los soldados no pod an y lo admiten estar seguros de lo que ten an frente creemos que hab a fundamentos suficientes para que se dieran cuenta que estaban frente a periodistas esto nos pone en una posici n en la que los periodistas no pueden levantar una c mara en presencia de los soldados israel es sin correr peligro de que les disparen eso es inaceptable y hablaremos con las autoridades israel es sobre c mo podemos mejorar la seguridad de nuestros periodistas en el futuro
5332743 el informe israel sobre el asesinato de fadel ha suscitado temores entre los periodistas palestinos que cubren el conflicto con israel en gaza entre los palestinos y los israel es en la franja de gaza sobre la misi n ustedes saben la misi n de cubrir y filmar y hemos estado escuchando comentarios de todos los otros colegas de que ya no est n seguros de sus vidas tras un informe como este que deja en claro que el simple hecho de levantar una c mara en la calle en un campo de refugiados o cerca de la frontera puede poner la vida de una persona en peligro
5332744 en este incidente del 16 de abril seis civiles fueron asesinados con proyectiles tipo flechette un arma ilegal que no deber a ser utilizada en estas condiciones en la franja de gaza y una de estas seis v ctimas era un periodista por todas estas razones era de esperarse que el ej rcito iniciara y dirigiera una investigaci n minuciosa sobre este caso pero decidi no hacerlo la falta de responsabilidad en este caso se refleja en la falta de responsabilidad en la muerte de miles de palestinos que fueron asesinados en los territorios ocupados
5332745 advertencia en este predio se utilizan dispositivos el ctricos paralizantes
5332746 lo que hoy d a ha expresado el pueblo boliviano con su voto es para consolidar este proceso de cambio estamos ac para seguir avanzando en la recuperaci n de nuestros recursos naturales en la consolidaci n de la nacionalizaci n en la recuperaci n de nuestras empresas del estado
5332747 lo que menos quiero ser yo es un factor disociador o que aprovechen la imagen de manfred para venir a una confrontaci n entre cochabambinos y es por eso que yo en el d a de hoy le estoy dejando al secretario general de la prefectura a johnny ferrel para que l contin e esta labor mientras yo haga las acciones legales pertinentes mientras yo demuestre que el decreto de la magistrada hab a sido nom s por la justicia boliviana
5332748 le pedimos a las naciones unidas y la sociedad internacional que presionen a corea del norte pakist n e israel a desnuclearizarse y tomar medidas dr sticas contra las armas nucleares que se sospecha tiene ir n

5332793 i was saddened on august 16 to hear that beobook publisher aleksandar jasic had halted publication of the jewel of medina because of protests from some in the serbian muslim community and to be honest i was confused did these muslims after reading my book really think i had degraded muhammad and aisha id thought i was doing the opposite my intentions were to celebrate these great historical figures while dispelling misunderstandings about islam

5332819 the war in najaf is a battle for political control a battle conducted by political shiite clerics and is being watched by sunni religious groups so that they too may gain from the political fallout of the war
5332820 it is an obligation incumbent on the muslims to kill american citizens in iraq since they are in iraq in order to assist the soldiers and the occupation forces it is forbidden however to desecrate their corpses
5332821 there is an escalation in the aggression and the distraction perpetrated against the iraqi people its cities and its holy sites the epitome of which was the bombing of najaf the burial place of the greatest imam in islam the righteous caliph
5332822 in light of the barbaric crimes being perpetrated in iraq and in palestine by the american zionist alliance against the arabs and the muslims and even against all of humanity as barbaric crimes are occurring in darfur in sudan the clerics the leaders of the islamic movement the intellectual figures and those who labor to spread the message of islam who have signed this call emphasize their complete solidarity with the iraqi and palestinian peoples and with the noble and brave national islamic resistance and call on them to join ranks in the struggle against the occupation in addition they call on our people the arabs and the muslims on all of the religious authorities and the liberation forces everywhere to oppose the occupation and its barbaric crimes in iraq and in palestine through offering every type of material and moral support to the honorable resistance and its prisoners and their families
5332823 there is no alternative other than that the muslim peoples continue their political and national support of the resistance materially and morally in palestine iraq and afghanistan
5332824 islam considers the resistance to be jihad for the sake of allah and this is a commandment a personal obligation fardhayn incumbent on all of the residents of the occupied countries this commandment takes precedence over all other religious duties even a woman is obligated to go to war even without her husbands permission and youth are permitted to go out and fight
5332825 solidarity with muqtada al sadr and with his brothers who are resisting the american occupation
5332826 to express their solidarity and to strengthen the national unity in the struggle against the repressive aggression directed against us all
5332827 no right thinking individual would dispute that the resistance to occupation is a right which is firmly grounded in all of the divine laws religious rules and customs
5332828 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim

5332835 do you get many complaints about the shipyard and applied management i came home from work last week around 8pm to find my door ajar and my pet locked in my bedroom without ac food water or means to go to the bathroom please note my door was open propped open by both the dead bolt and a rolled up piece of paper apparently the management group has been going apartment to apartment to upgrade to fios and it was my day but shouldnt there be some accountability for that i mean aside from animal cruelty and the fact that my apartment was left open all day where anyone could have entered and taken anything but im a 30 year old single woman what if someone let themselves in and waited for me to come home thats a safety issue i spoke with a friend an attorney and he said though it was negligence on their part there are no damages because nothing was taken and my pet was shaken up but ok however i cant believe that is it ive called twice and left messages expressing my unhappiness and no one has called me back this isnt the first time ive had issues either i had raw sewage backed up into my bathtub seven times each time they sent someone over to put bath crystals equal to drano down the drain and said it wont happen again it wasnt until i threatened legal action and that id contact the department of health that they finally sent over a plumber to fix the problem it took him 20 minutes to snake the drain which they should have done initially and tell me how he couldnt believe its taken as long as it has its been three weeks knock on wood and so far so good i started taking showers without wearing flip flops for the first time two weeks ago since april either way im very upset about finding my home completely exposed and my pet trapped in a room without food water or ac for hours again aside from the obvious there are also safety issues involved anyone else complaining about this management team or anything i cant believe im the only one having issues also do you know who i can elevate this too i cant believe they arent calling me back i dont really know what to do anymore

5332955 these initiatives reflect more than a year of planning and our ongoing commitment to improving the way we meet the changing news and information needs of local residents and businesses in our tech savvy community
5332956 marketing surveys completed last year clearly showed that residents are increasingly obtaining their local news sports and event information on a daily basis from palo alto online and had a preference for one print edition per week instead of two
5332957 as residents increasingly prefer to turn to the web for up to the minute news and information it makes less and less sense to incur the enormous effort expense and environmental impact of printing and transporting newspapers to readers
5332958 breaking news is now stale by the time even a daily newspaper reaches readers
5332959 our vision is to increasingly rely on our website and our daily electronic edition to provide local news and sports coverage and to use our newspaper to present in depth and feature coverage plus summaries of the weeks news
5332960 like all newspapers we are reducing our costs wherever we can during this economic downturn
5332961 but these new initiatives reflect our long term view of how we can best serve the needs of our readers and advertisers

5333130 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5333131 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5333132 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5333133 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5333134 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5333138 now my main goal is to win the nba championship
5333139 well have to wait and see how things develop with germany in the years ahead
5333140 i dont want to make any concrete plans right now
5333141 but i knew when i came off the court tonight that it was the last time for a couple of years so from that point of view it was a wonderful feeling to go out on a high note
5333142 everythings still open but i think i need a break
5333143 on the day before my 21st birthday i landed at incheon they unloaded us off the troop ship and all we had was a tent a cot and a sleeping bag after a couple of days they found a place for us to go and i ended up with the medical company 7th division 31st regiment we pulled guard duty for a couple of days then a mess sergeant came through and asked if anybody wanted to be a cook i was with a guy from georgia who said rode and i will do it so he volunteered me it was the best thing he ever did it was the best thing anybody ever did otherwise we would have been assigned to the infantry
5333144 we did our thing in the kitchen the rest of our time there from march 28 1953 until the middle of june 1954 we were right on the 38th parallel we had a doctor for a company commander and they had an aid station up on the line if they needed to leave them theyd bring them to the hospital depending on how badly they were banged up theyd give them blood and whatever else needed to be done
5333145 at night theyd fire artillery shells and you could hear them whistling theyd light up the sky a lot of times during the day the north koreans and chinese were like rats they wouldnt come out but at night theyd come out and the air force lit up our area like daylight theyd drop flares so you could see the rats
5333146 one night we had creamed chicken for supper ill never forget it was about 5 oclock and either a tank company or heavy mortar company put a shell in on the line i was on duty as assistant mess sergeant when the guys came in with the wounded on a 2 1 2 ton truck blood was everywhere most of them ended up in body bags
5333147 there was fighting up on the hill one night and we got up the next morning and there was a stack of clothes outside where guys were being treated bloody clothes were as high as the ceiling theyd just come through with scissors and cut them off their backs and through them out back then theyd get wrapped up and hauled away
5333148 we had mess gear all over and guys just scattered it went through our tent and blew a hole in it but didnt hurt anybody
5333149 we had a guy whose job was to move people when shells came in one day he saw a guy wrap up a piece of paper and stick it in his sleeping bag well they all looked the same olive green so he switched sleeping bags with the guy and when it was unraveled they found a map of the whole area it showed our company location and other companys locations so he was a north korean spy when he was there was when we were getting hit a lot how he got his messages out i dont know
5333150 im glad i served things need straightened out like theyre doing now in iraq it has to be done otherwise we dont know what the world might come to war is a horrible thing and it never was easy from the civil war on through if we didnt do it wed probably have people from other countries over here dictating what were going to do

5333268 it makes sense why they would want to be called it it makes no sense why we would want to call them that
5333269 this feeds into their idea that this is a religious war and its not
5333270 they want it to be a war of religions but we have said very clearly that this is not a war on islam its not christianity vs islam in some way its about radicals its about extremists who are using violence
5333271 the fact is the muslim world isnt waiting around holding its breath to hear the u s government an infidel entity define islamic terms for them
5333272 this seems to me unprecedented when we fought the japanese and we fought the nazis we called them what they called themselves
5333273 if osama bin laden calls himself a mujahid we should understand what a mujahid is and we should understand that that is in english a holy warrior whos fighting on behalf of islam
5333274 you want to know your enemy how they think what they call themselves what those terms mean
5333275 according to islamic law offensive jihad offensive not just to defend yourself but offensive to go out and invade is as codified and is obilgatory
5333276 the worlds muslims arent holding their breath to hear what sort of islamic legitimacy the us government is about to confer on al qaeda since it is not for non muslims to decide what is and is not islamic in the first place

5333305 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me
5333306 a leader god has blessed us with at this time
5333307 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out
5333308 and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5333309 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5333310 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5333311 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5333312 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5333313 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5333314 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5333315 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5333316 and they delude themselves into thinking they advance american interests in some odd

5333697 how democrats can win big in 2010 and beyond by doing the opposite of what theyre doing now
5333698 beginning with its namesake george mcgovern in 1972 the mcgovern party has been trounced repeatedly by the nixon party not because of its economic agenda which the public actually prefers to the alternative but because of its unpopular stands on issues like race based affirmative action illegal immigration crime and punishment and national security
5333699 there is no doubt that at some point between 2004 and 2008 american politics changed it is clear to everyone not least conservatives that the era of right wing hegemony that began with richard nixons election in 1968 has come to an end
5333700 between 1932 and 1964 the roosevelt party won seven of nine presidential elections losing only in 1952 and 1956
5333701 the roosevelt party ran on economic issues and didnt care whether voters were in favor of sex or against it on principle as long as they supported the new deal
5333702 fdr was able to assemble his coalition only because social issues did not divide his voters
5333703 in fact the majority of americans including many social conservatives never ceased to support new deal policies which from social security and medicare to the g
5333704 note that almost all of the policy proposals that excite the american public are exactly the sort of old fashioned
5333705 the public wants the middle class welfare state to be rounded out by a few major additions chiefly healthcare and childcare and the public also wants the government to grow the economy by investing in public works and favoring companies that locate their production facilities inside the u
5333706 a newer deal party that ran on this economic agenda could attract southern baptist creationists as well as marin county agnostics
5333707 a big reason that the democrats won back congress in 2006 and are likely to keep it in 2008 is nominating and electing socially conservative economic populists like heath shuler
5333708 unfortunately the upper middle class left with its unerring instinct for political suicide is probably incapable of seizing the moment and bringing more baptists and catholics into the democratic party because it has developed an almost superstitious distaste for religious conservatives

5333843 the admission that obamas mentor was frank marshall davis an identified cpusa member can only add to growing public concern about obamas relationship with a communist pawn of moscow who was the subject of security investigations by the fbi and various congressional committees which examined soviet activities in the u s

5333855 violence in iraq has declined sharply over the past year following a u s troop buildup a sunni revolt against al qaida in iraq and a shiite militia cease fire
5333856 afp also reports that in baghdads jadid district iraqi forces arrested the head of an awakening council for involvement in terrorism and conducted a raid on guerrillas so that 250 displaced persons could return to the neighborhood

5334054 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognizing the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5334055 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5334056 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5334057 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5334058 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5334059 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved

5334102 stockholm afp restaurant goers with food allergies can soon chow down in sweden with confidence in eateries bearing allergy free certificates

5334104 this is the first time in sweden and the first time in europe
5334105 its a question of competition too because it could be good for a restaurant to show the sign on the door
5334106 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
5334107 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

5334110 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
5334111 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
5334112 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
5334113 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
5334114 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
5334115 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
5334116 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
5334117 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
5334118 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
5334119 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
5334120 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
5334121 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
5334122 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement

5334365 no charge sheet can stand against me not even a single charge can be proven against me as i have full trust in allah almighty and i did everything with the belief of pakistan first
5334366 all stake holders whether they were soldiers politicians bureaucrats members of civil society ulema were consulted in all decisions
5334367 impeachment is their governments right and to face it is my right
5334368 i beleive that no charge sheet can stand against me becuase i never did things for my own self but for my country

5334376 i publicly announced support to the government and offered to share all my experience with them to help address complicated issues it was confronting
5334377 the coalition considered me a problem and not a solution
5334378 are they afraid of me or my obligations under the constitution
5334379 i have fought two wars for pakistan and still have the same spirit for my country
5334380 i took power of the country when it was at the brink of being declared a failed state

5334632 the allies will reiterate full support for the territorial integrity of georgia
5334633 the foreign ministers will also probably send a message of solidarity and will agree on a package of measures
5334634 including the international mechanism to monitor respect of the engagements taken by both sides
5334635 we are going to help rebuild georgia into a strong georgian state
5334636 the russians will have failed in their effort to undermine georgia and we will be looking at what we can do with the states around that region as well

5334669 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
5334670 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
5334671 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
5334672 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart

5334725 yes i did know it was today yes i did know about it for 3 weeks but i work best under pressure
5334726 everybody else has these different feelings or aspirations about what he should do or not do all were asking him to do is come in and embrace our culture which is be a great person graduate and help us win a national championship
5334727 that day is going to come there is no question
5334728 hes very talented who knows when that is im not rushing that i just want him to know where to line up and how to take a hand off hes been great hes been jumping in on all kinds of special teams he wants to play that
5334729 well see im not rushing him im not putting any pressure on him to lead us to the next level i just want him to do all the right things and have fun and do things right
5334730 because were going to have some great running backs with a great ability to run the ball but were also going to have some playmaking wide receivers who can move down the field as well
5334731 darrell is a power speed back ray is more of a slasher type of guy and rodney is just a blur
5334732 that dude is so quick when he runs i dont think his heels ever touch the ground hes constantly moving forward
5334733 i dont think its burden i like it it puts colorado back out in the national scene and thats all you can ask for
5334734 darrells a humble kid he knows there is no such thing as entitlement he has to work hard in order to achieve the success that hes had before hes come in and he fits right in with the guys the guys like him they call him five star its a good match
5334735 im just adjusting to the altitude the altitude is tough but im good i just water down my body and get as many reps as i can
5334736 you want to prove everybody wrong and you want them to start believing if we can go out there and do that then i think everybodys view of us would change theyll stop ranking us in the same spot every year in the big 12 south between baylor and tech or somebody
5334737 slowly we can start creeping our way up there but we have to earn everybodys respect before that can happen
5334738 we couldnt get to the passer and we couldnt stop the run
5334739 the teams that have won it in the past have played good defense were aware of that
5334740 but you also better be able to score in this league because the majority of the teams in this league can score a lot of points
5334741 the reason we had success is because of the process
5334742 we didnt run around saying i want to beat this team and i want to beat that team shoot anybody can do that
5334743 its about doing all the things every day thats how you get good
5334744 i think we worry about going out there and getting better every single day we cant take any backward steps
5334745 of course with such an explosive offense its hard sometimes just to keep up with them
5334746 anyone who watched our games last year our defense did a lot of great things and made a lot of great plays like the offense
5334747 we know what we have to do and we know how we have to play
5334748 these other guys are good quarterbacks but i have supreme confidence in my abilities as a leader and playmaker
5334749 people say our offense was jordy and we take that as a slap in the face
5334750 he was a big contributor to our offense but we had a lot of guys who showed week in and week out that they could get the job done im just looking forward to seeing who steps up

5334810 aapl and rimm are both pushing all of the other manufactures to the sidelines its clear that rimms blackberry is the dominating force in the corporate smartphone market but the apple iphone has shaken things up quite a bit on the consumer side
5334811 the combination of the new apple model flying off the shelves and rumors of a postponement for one of rimms new releases has raised questions among some analysts as to rimms ability to fight back
5334812 research in motion may be planning to release several new smartphones this year including the kickstart the thunder and the already announced bold
5334813 they will each likely contain blackberrys hallmark features such as push e mail camera gps and wi fi as well as features unique to the specific models while the apple iphone has captured the hearts and minds of its user base so has research in motions blackberry
5334814 in terms of winners the global consumer and enterprise smartphone markets are big enough to support both apple and research in motion its the other cell phone manufacturers that look like the real losers
5334815 it appears aapl and rimm are on a collision course in the consumer market as rim gears up for its counterattack against the iphone but by owning both of these smartphone kingpins well be sitting pretty as these two companies duke it out

5334941 it had a pretty good vibe but it wasnt quite right it didnt really talk football at all we called hank williams jr and spoke to his manager a great guy by the name of merle kilgore and we asked if hank would have any interest in working on mnf we asked if he knew anything about football and merles reply was does hank know football hank is an american he knows football and ever since then that was it
5334942 the story i got was that the son of one of the producers of mnf had my tape in his tape player the producer said what is that the truth is usually stranger than what you can make up and that is how it went down when it comes on for that 60 seconds it hits you right in the face and makes you go wow it really gets people in a good mood and pumped up and ready for the game it has been a wonderful ride i have had a lot of fun doing it and im going to have a lot more fun
5334943 we played a european and world powerhouse we played a very good game of basketball

5334947 he is one of the best football players in the world
5334948 i like messi even though hes on the other team
5334949 when he gets the ball he is unbelievable argentina are better than brazil they have a modern passing game
5334950 many people think the olympics are not as important to us as the world cup but were brazil and every time we take to the pitch we do so to win we want to claim our countrys first gold medal in football
5334951 we have to play against everything we have to play to win theres no other way
5334952 if the opposition play open football against us then we can play open and pretty
5334953 i came here especially to see him i am devastated i just bought one ticket the olympics is over for me as well as liu xiang

5334974 footballs putting others first being selfless is a big part of our culture
5334975 wed give anything for a bigger purpose thats how we were raised and thats helped us on the football field
5334976 i always knew i was tongan even at a young age
5334977 i knew there was something different about me besides the color of my skin or my facial features
5334978 they have a very competitive nature and are very athletic
5334979 theyre very sincere kids and lots of fun to coach were thrilled with the way guys have worked
5334980 its not like a normal father son relationship its more man to man the older you get its more like hes your brother
5334981 the way i was brought up wasnt better or anything like that but our way of life has always been different
5334982 my dad was a boxer for years and he was pretty good my dad wanted me to be boxer when i was younger
5334983 from being around him and watching him fight my mom said youre not going to make my son a boxer ill leave you
5334984 i was younger and i thought i was older than i really was
5334985 i went out got them and when i came home i got beat up they were really disappointed in me
5334986 luckily i had parents who saw the importance of raising their children in the culture i was always brought up in our ways our way of living our culture and our lifestyle
5334987 i was brought up to be very grateful thankful and to always work hard what you get is what you deserve what you put in is what you get out
5334988 my parents always taught me to be respectful and i never really knew anything else
5334989 i think with tongan athletes and i see it in samoan and polynesian players too theres a personal pride with toughness a pride in following authority and doing things the family way
5334990 its become dangerous to do something good for the community
5334991 i have samoan and tongan friends and sometimes they dont get along its so prideful with where you come from i steer clear of it
5334992 all that stuff is in the past our cultures are really similar the bond between us is really strong
5334993 its like a brotherhood we have we come here and really were all the same there are jokes that fly around though thats all just fun and games
5334994 were the minorities of the team when someone with a similar heritage comes here we form a bond they formed an even closer bond because theyre all tongans
5334995 you see other tongans or samoans and its not a hate thing of course theres some pride there some were better than you thats just football though whenever you see other tongans you embrace them
5334996 were basically the same people were cut from the same mold were all here trying to make the most of our opportunity
5334997 hes tongan and im tongan for him playing right next to me i know hes been through everything hes like a big brother type i can relate to him same blood and everything it just helps to have a tongan brother right next to me
5334998 we look at all these guys as our brothers we do everything together
5334999 a lot of what football is today is players trying to be individuals
5335000 coming from where we come from its no about us were just really happy to be here and were happy to be contributing to this awesome program
5335001 you need to understand who is truly the head of the household and who you should talk to and direct the conversation towards
5335002 i had chance to have dinner at uonas place and we had some stuff
5335003 i thought it was really cool that hed just eat it
5335004 tongas called the friendly islands were really family oriented family comes first before anything theres no individuality
5335005 its nothing like here the island life is way laid back theres nothing going on like here here there are cars all over the place running from morning to night
5335006 im so grateful that my family taught me to be a giver and not a taker
5335007 even when you have nothing you give until you cant give any more it makes me come out here and work even harder
5335008 theres a very strong sense of family and knowing their place with those guys
5335009 theyve got a lot of respect for their community and it really adds to their character
5335010 you worry about others before you take care of yourself thats something that filis done with me
5335011 hes really helped me out a lot other guys do that too but thats a big thing for tongans
5335012 martin and uona play the ukulele theyre awesome they can make stuff up one of the other guys will come in and throw in a beat
5335013 all of a sudden its a music video in there
5335014 its not only on the field we help each other off the field
5335015 were all members of the lds religion the church of jesus christ of latter day saints not only do we have that relationship on the field off the field we make sure one anothers all right
5335016 its a different culture were big and were laid back
5335017 theyre great family people theyre outwardly friendly theyre willing to hug men its a different thing
5335018 the way i was told fili was the first tongan player to have ever played here that blows me away now we have five
5335019 thats remarkable i dont know how that happened there certainly has been an influx of tongan kids playing and involved in recruiting
5335020 theyre doing a beautiful job all over the place not just here
5335021 actually i was the one who burned it down i was playing with matches in the garage the fire started and i got scared so i ran away there was no one around to put it out
5335022 its definitely special especially at usc there arent too many tongans or polynesians playing college football
5335023 were all coming up but its still a small percentage its definitely a treat to be with all these tongan kids here at usc and have the culture here
5335024 a lot of us are first generation and our parents come from humble beginnings we see this as a great opportunity to better ourselves and to give back to our family
5335025 theyve always said your money is your money but the way i was brought up i cant do that im going to buy them a big ole house
5335026 for me to even be here right now i give a lot of props to my parents

5335071 1 3 gegen den vfb stuttgart im ersten spiel nach der bundesliga r ckkehr wie haben sie die partie gesehen
5335072 das war ein absolut verdienter sieg f r den vfb stuttgart wir haben vor allem in der ersten halbzeit lehrgeld gezahlt auch wenn wir selbst gute chancen hatten das 0 1 ist ungl cklich weil zu diesem zeitpunkt sascha r sler verletzt au erhalb behandelt wird da sind wir dann im mittelfeld nicht mehr organsiert beim 0 2 geben wir den ball an der grundlinie her das darf nicht passieren und auch beim 0 3 sind wir in der vorw rtsbewegung die beiden treffer haben uns gezeigt dass in dieser liga jeder kleine fehler bestraft wird
5335073 war ihre abwehr noch nicht auf das tempo in der bundesliga eingestellt
5335074 die beiden tore haben nichts mit umschalten zu tun bei solchen fehlern hat es die verteidigung nat rlich sehr schwer stuttgart hat heute super umgeschaltet wir haben es nicht gut genug gemacht und m ssen daran in den n chsten tagen und wochen weiter hart arbeiten wir wissen dass wir noch zulegen m ssen im abwehrverhalten und im umschalten von offensive auf defensive
5335075 wir hatten vorne einige chancen auch direkt nach der pause eine hundertprozentige wenn man die vergibt rgert man sich nat rlich aber dass wir uns viele torchancen erspielt haben ist positiv und nicht aus jeder chance wird ein tor aber wir haben uns nicht aufgegeben das ist eine gute eine wichtige charaktereigenschaft wir haben voll auf risiko gespielt und wollten das spiel irgendwie drehen leider haben wir es nicht mehr geschafft das 2 3 zu machen und f r noch mehr spannung zu sorgen
5335076 wie haben sie die leistung ihres torh ters christofer heimeroth gesehen

5335141 i dont know if most people will realise how prevalent adhd is becoming the national survey of mental health and wellbeing 1998 reported that approximately 11 per cent of australian children aged between 6 and 17 have a diagnosis of adhd with the disorder having a greater frequency in boys than in girls
5335142 for the general public parents and teachers adhd is associated with poor behaviour with treatments being seen as effective if they reduced the symptoms i e improve out of control behaviour therefore much current research has concentrated on improving behaviour with little attention being focussed on the underlying problems with executive functioning particularity inhibitory control
5335143 in my research i have looked at the efficacy of intervention on this key aspect of cognition especially inhibition cognition refers to the process of acquiring knowledge by the use of reasoning intuition or perception this study is one of the first to examine the impact of stimulant medications on both cognitive and behavioural measures of inhibition
5335144 to our knowledge this is the first extended duration prospective follow up study to examine the comparative effects of medication alone and low intensity individualised family centred behavioural therapy on both behavioural and cognitive based measures of executive functioning this research adds to a broad body of research which will help us better understand the best ways to treat children with adhd

5335248 these resolutions effectively dismiss the national intelligence estimate and the reports of the iaea in favor of claims made by an iranian opposition group that the us government has declared to be a terrorist organization and these resolutions repeat the irresponsible war justifying process in 2002 03 that led to the war in iraq

5335306 given the high food prices around the world and the need for poor people to lower their cost of food it just does not make sense for the doha negotiations to founder upon this barrier

5335338 they wanted me to betray the principles of my job and to turn me into a spy

5335372 stupefyingly arrogant and anti democratic to refuse to take no for an answer
5335373 june 21st i put it to you that little could be so stupefyingly arrogant and anti democratic as wishing to deny to the irish government on a matter that is entirely between it and the irish people the right to see whether the reasons why many irish voters said no can be resolved

5335401 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services
5335402 it was part of the cold war mentality that saw security threats traitors and spies everywhere
5335403 gay people were regarded as vulnerable to blackmail even if they were open and out about their sexuality

5335410 although my colleagues and i recognized that labeling genetically modified foods to support consumer choice is an important issue for consumers we were hesitant to support some of the provisions outlined in the bill
5335411 corporate interests trump issues important to consumers in the conservative party caucus wonder why
5335412 if there were any concerns with genetically modified foods that could be mitigated through labeling such as significant nutritional or compositional factors health canada could legitimately propose regulations to require mandatory labeling genetically engineered foods pass the rigorous safety assessment as required by the food and drugs act
5335413 the fact that the majority of the concerns over gmos reside beyond the simple compositional comparison of the gmo versus the conventionally grown product at this point in time issues such as pesticide use on round up ready gmo monocrops leading to toxic contamination of soil water air and thus all living species malicious corporate control of the food supply threats to the sustainability of the small family farm biodiversity contaminatin of non gmo seed banks and the farmers right to save their own seed not to mention the lack of long term independent research on the safety of gmo foods themselves are not things our scientist can understand nor test in a lab and thus we think we have a good excuse not to consider them to be risky
5335414 it would not be justifiable to apply different rules to genetically engineered foods than are applied to all other products
5335415 while we can justify applying different rules to organic foods that have a different culture of production because we stand to get a nice slice of the pie from both farmers and 3rd party certifiers by licensing the canadian organic standard and gaining a marketing monopoly on the word organic which has been around longer than anyones great grandmother has been gardening we would never dream of forcing the big businesses behind bio tech foods to pay any extra for labeling or licensing let alone cut into their market share by informing consumers as to the culture of gmo food production through enforced labeling
5335416 health canada has participated in the development of a voluntary standard for the labeling of biotechnology derived foods the private sector could then based on consumer demand act accordingly along the suggested terms
5335417 mandatory labeling to address non health and safety issues could potentially be viewed as an unjustified barrier to trade and would put canada at odds with its largest trading partner the united states

5335449 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

5335460 the draw is a little tight but we never lose hope we prepared for everybody i would say toni is prepared to face anybody in her bracket
5335461 versus croatia its going to be a tight first round match but we know how to fight the croatian
5335462 this is a challenging draw but we must first think of croatia at the moment we will not think whos going to be winner in the other bracket when we win against croatia we will plan for the next fight
5335463 this is one of the great development success stories of the last 40 to 50 years

5335465 is widely known as a pious person so he doesnt feel the need to appease the conservatives
5335466 what really makes the difference is neutrality impartiality and the ability to bring in outside powers as guarantors of an eventual deal
5335467 and all the more so if they are involved in inter religious dialogue
5335468 long term commitment long term presence on the ground moral and spiritual authority and a niche to mobilise others for peace
5335469 a lack of focus on results and a possible lack of professionalism
5335470 faith based organisations have a special role to play in zones of religious conflict
5335471 i do not believe that inter faith dialogue will bring about peace in the middle east
5335472 but i do believe that it is essential if peace is to be brought about to ignore religion is a very grave mistake and i think the oslo accords made that mistake
5335473 there are no equivalent mechanisms for intrastate dispute resolution despite the fact that most violent conflicts today are not international but intrastate in character
5335474 the challenge is thus not being a skilful warrior but a skilful negotiator
5335475 neither side wanted their own people and cadres to know they were talking to the other side
5335476 you shouldnt try to copy the top performers in pisa
5335477 because position in those league tables depends on lots of other things besides what happens in schools
5335478 they used to teach only one third of the students but the comprehensive schools used almost the same curriculum as the grammar schools had and we discovered that the two thirds were mostly able to cope with it
5335479 what you are planning might be the right thing to do but if teachers arent on board it will be very hard to make anything happen
5335480 politicians here seem to think that a day without an education announcement is a day wasted

5335496 wow lets give credit to where credit is due he was a little bit more than an artist philosopher now wasnt he lets take a closer look into the life of ernst haeckel that you casually tossed aside or purposely omitted ive noticed you like to do that must be why you dont like cut and paste to many hard truths back on point ernst haeckel was an eminent german biologist naturalist philosopher physician professor and artist who discovered described and named thousands of new species mapped a genealogical tree relating all life forms and coined many terms in biology including phylum phylogeny ecology and the kingdom protista he was thrown out of his university for fraud it was his pictures of early similar life forms that he made up he knew they were wrong and presented them any way it was years before he was caught and yes prominent evolutionists still use his work today mostly because they dont know any better
5335497 well i expect to find accurate drawings in a museum if there going to display his work they need to put a disclaimer saying fraud yes you would agree right
5335498 there in brand new biology books look into it or is it you need fraudulent proof to carry your belief forward
5335499 ill agree with you on this what i disagree with is making models life scenes pretty pictures and animation of ape like people when you only have a piece of hip bone a tooth or in one instance they only had a single tooth and that was from a pig nice
5335500 oh there we go omitting the parts we dont like again maybe you should have cut and pasted this one here you go oh heres your link to oxford dictionary

5335502 are you sure about that ill give you a little more time
5335503 i think you need to shutup about straw man arguments coal needs to be rapidly buried in sediments and you need a heat source your argument is just assinine surprise surprise

5335505 have you ever noticed that coal is always found in seams you have peat for brains
5335506 a perfect vacuum with a gaseous pressure of absolute zero is a philosophical concept that is never observed in practice theres all kind of thing out there that shouldnt be like dust micro meteorites i believe he was referring gravitational forces cosmic rays gamma busts all kind of things that can distort light oohhh oohh dont forget dark matter you know that stuff that exists that we cant prove see or detect
5335507 dont forget dark matter you know the stuff that exists that we cant prove see or detect
5335508 the stuff that exists that we cant prove see or detect
5335509 all stars are the same intrinsic luminosity so apparent brightness is simply related to distance
5335510 well i expect to find accurate drawings in a museum if there going to display his work they need to put a disclaimer saying fraud yes you would agree right
5335511 lets see god created the heavens and the earth that tells me the god made the heavens and the earth are you following the earth ok now god moved upon the face of the waters waters god made the earth then moved over the waters on the earth did you get it that time i know its hard to understand what with you omitting so much of your quotes and all but i think thats pretty clear
5335512 the stuff that exists that we cant prove see or detect
5335513 all stars are the same intrinsic luminosity so apparent brightness is simply related to distance
5335514 you know as well as i do thats not what there in a museum for that comment shows your true nature and religious beliefs for evolution your willing to prop up a lie and call it truth that is why so many people are leaving darwinism
5335515 you nearly agree and then you agree is that like you voted against the war before you voted for it you know very well ernst haeckel made those drawings deliberately to mislead people along with piltdown man and every other transitional fossil thats why there are none you just believe a lie and will do anything to prop it up and thats sad

5335518 this has been answered and makes you look fecicious the lord didnt tell us exactly when he made copper but their it is this is really a straw man argument and you know it
5335519 cant answer it can you theres no way out of that one
5335520 theres all kind of thing out there that shouldnt be like dust micro meteorites that seems to put it in practice
5335521 god is so easy to prove its sad its only when personal beliefs a religion like evolution gets in the way
5335522 see 7 wonders of mount st helens here is a brief quote regarding coal dr steven austin wrote his doctoral dissertation at penn state university on a new model for coal formation based on his study of a coal field in kentucky while geologists have used a peat swamp model to explain coal formation for over 100 years austin argued that explanation doesnt fit because coal is coarsely textured like bark not finely textured like swamp peat swamp peat contains root material coal does not swamp peat rests on a layer of soil coal often rests on a rock layer no swamp peat has been found partly formed into coal
5335523 austin advanced a floating mat model that a watery catastrophe stripped away millions of acres of forest and tangled them into mats the mats floated on an ocean over kentucky bumping against one another and dropping their bark to the bottom subsequent volcanic activity provided heat and pressure the final ingredients used in laboratories to produce coal the result was rich seams of coal in kentucky and a ph d for austin
5335524 just ten months later mount st helens erupted dumping vast amounts of vegetation into spirit lake including a million logs dr austin found the logs on the lake stripped of their bark the bottom of the lake was strewn with up to three feet of bark mixed with other vegetation and sediment to this day the material remains as merely slowly decaying vegetation but if a catastrophe supplies the right amount of heat and pressure the material will quickly change to coal dr austins research indicates that the idea of coal formation requiring millions of years is highly questionable
5335525 to this day the material remains as merely slowly decaying vegetation
5335526 i take back what i said about you having peat for brains i was being unduly charitable
5335527 you can say what ever field it belongs in it belongd in the trash can this is exactly how i learned evolution in my nice little brain washing school im pretty sure im way older than you so you probably learned the same thing if i did talking to kids in school today say tell me there being taught the same thing cosmic all the way to micro if hovind was right about anything its this this is how its taught this is how its presented in the american school system set up by robert muller if you dont like it help change it
5335528 to this day the material remains as merely slowly decaying vegetation but if a catastrophe supplies the right amount of heat and pressure the material will quickly change to coal dr austins research indicates that the idea of coal formation requiring millions of years is highly questionable
5335529 americans do not believe that humans evolved and the vast majority says that even if they evolved god guided the process just 13 percent say that god was not involved support for evolution is more heavily concentrated among those with more education and among those who attend religious services rarely or not at all
5335530 the bible is the actual word of god and it is to be taken literally word for word
5335531 i dont find estimating what could have happened during a time in which there was no recorded history to be actual science its speculation at best tell ya what we can create life right now why is it implausible that it could not have been created we know its possible because we can do it today
5335532 saying there was a monkey man millions of years ago that died off is pure speculation
5335533 i dont find estimating what could have happened during a time in which there was no recorded history to be actual science its speculation at best tell ya what we can create life right now why is it implausible that it could not have been created we know its possible because we can do it today
5335534 saying there was a monkey man millions of years ago that died off is pure speculation
5335535 this lawless behavior is unacceptable and we will not tolerate it
5335536 the safety of our employees public and rainbow participants is our number one priority and we will continue to protect everyone on the national forest
5335537 the forest service incident management team appreciates all of the help and assistance from the agencies coordinating with us during this incident
5335538 the mob began to advance throwing sticks and rocks at the officers crowd control tactics were used to keep moving through the group of rainbows
5335539 this lawless behavior is unacceptable and we will not tolerate it
5335540 the safety of our employees public and rainbow participants is our number one priority and we will continue to protect everyone on the national forest
5335541 i got out and yelled what the f are you doing
5335542 these people deliberately for hours were aggressively working the camp over and working the people over
5335543 they chose the kiddie village the one place the kids to take their stand and create a riot and i bought into it they were looking for an excuse to do some damage to us
5335544 i have some real concerns about how this is handled
5335545 particularly the pretext arrests the idea that people are just cruising around looking for people to arrest when there have been no complaints and no reason for them to be there
5335546 kids are here this is kiddie village everything is fine
5335547 many children were visibly upset crying hysterically and had to be calmed down
5335548 the police then fired shots and hit a child before turning to fire upon another man carrying a child on his back the man went down and the child fell
5335549 why did you shoot me im trying to help you
5335550 theyve rainbow gatherers been attracting a different kind of crowd in recent years
5335551 was shot six times in the back no wounds in the front one shot went through his arm entering his bare tricep and exiting his bicep leaving two holes with blood pouring out the entrance wound in the back and the exit wound in the front requiring on site medical and bandaging
5335552 tasered and assaulted a guy last night july 2 multiple officers tasered him we spent the entire morning trying to figure out what jail they took him to because they dont really want to tell us anything they supposedly tasered somebody else again this morning were still trying to verify that one
5335553 one defendant on wednesday apparently got out of hand and was subdued with a taser she said
5335554 if you can disrupt prayer you can disrupt mankind these demons leos in parking lot high fiving each other it just brings tears to my eyes what is going on in this country
5335555 special agent with the u s forest service currently assigned as an incident commander of the incident command team
5335556 every year we are we are going to be recertified in it
5335557 they are receiving training credits for being out here at the rainbow gathering this week
5335558 can you describe a little bit about the training that officers are receiving while they are here at the rainbow gathering
5335559 basically they have received training in formations and how to protect themselves how to dissipate crowds how to deal with crowds
5335560 in 1998 the forest service established a national response team the incident command team to deal with the group
5335561 the usfs has been trying to intimidate us since day one now with the creation of the ict supposedly under the usfs the harassment has gotten worse still their tactics havent worked as we continue to exercise our first amendment right to peaceably assemble on public lands it seems that finally their behavior and the validity of the ict as an organization of responders is being brought into question in the public court
5335562 we are not lab rats we are a peaceful people with over 36 years experience holding gatherings completely on our own and we wish to keep it that way we want this harassment to end now not one more cent of taxpayers dollars should be spent on funding policing of a self policing event
5335563 instead the leos involved in this harassment should receive felony convictions in federal court on counts of inciting a riot assault and battery child abuse reckless endangerment child endangerment false arrest infringing on civil liberties and animal cruelty to name a few

5335565 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5335566 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5335567 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5335568 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5335569 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5335570 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5335571 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

5335574 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5335575 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5335576 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5335577 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5335578 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5335579 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
5335580 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5335581 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5335582 there really is no time for any frivolity people are already working two jobs to put gas in the tank so they can drive from the first job to the second job people need to spend as much of their free time as possible for candidates
5335583 i would rather you go and work for a local candidate then read my book
5335584 on the issues and on the importance of the election
5335585 but i dont agree about reading his book if people are going to vote wisely they need to understand whats at stake
5335586 i expect youll see a lot of editorial excitement from us on that book
5335587 in this world of celebrity blogs and entertainment gossip television we are intensely aware of public figures who perform the same function as mythological figures did in an earlier period
5335588 when i first started to read it i thought oh it was going to be a hatchet job but i enjoyed it anyway i was amazed with what she could do with so few pages at the beginning
5335589 we just felt the media coverage would benefit from a clearer field postelection and that is looking increasingly true
5335590 i did not ask wealth for my own it was just to make my rival groan
5335591 giants the parallel lives of abraham lincoln and frederick douglass
5335592 his functions as commander in chief have been undertreated compared to many other aspects of his life and career
5335593 i had trouble with english class in high school thank god there was world war ii or i might still be there that should give you an idea of my reading background
5335594 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5335595 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5335596 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5335597 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5335598 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5335599 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5335600 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5335601 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5335602 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians
5335603 same side of the body and same leg but not the same injury
5335604 i spent some time this weekend getting treatment on it and hoping that it responds quickly like it usually does
5335605 the key is not to go out there and aggravate anything when im not ready to go
5335606 we are so thrilled to welcome ann on board for the 2008 2009 season
5335607 as a player ann was a dynamic leader and inspiration to her teammate she has a keen eye for analyzing the game and will be an asset for the team she will serve as the coordinator of defense but will share responsibility for all aspects of the team it is my pleasure to have the opportunity to work with ann again and to welcome her back to northwestern
5335608 the a grade would raise the bar and i know many of our students would have achieved the grade this time around

5335612 85 showed that he may quit as soon as he makes his first embarrassing play this season
5335613 85 simpson probably wont have a huge season in his first year but he has the athletic ability to be a superstar holt made only two catches for 22 yards but both receptions were on low hard thrown passes holt also made an impressive tackle on special teams on the opening kickoff
5335614 intense fruit forwardness with a luscious berry concentration a rich presentation on the palate with a lovely lingering finish
5335615 it s well intentioned advice and you ve probably even heard me use the words before but the next time someone tells you
5335616 if we did all of the things we are capable of doing we would literally astound ourselves

5335623 am i coming back of course i am i told my coaches im going to california to act but the truth is i may come back to the bengals as early as june
5335624 i wouldnt have him if he was offered for free
5335625 starting tailback rudi johnson has increased his weight to 225 pounds up from 212 last year and looks again like the bruising between the tackles runner of 2004 and 2005
5335626 rudi is determined to play at 225 pounds and become the jerome bettis style hammer between the tackles that he once was
5335627 if you read bengal stripes on a regular basis you know that im extremely hard on graham honestly i was going to give him a thumbs up after making two field goals without crying i was even going to pretend that his weak diving attempt for a tackle on the opening kickoff didnt happen after the bengals took a 21 17 lead with 2 42 left in the game graham kicked it out of bounds the ball was placed at the 40 and the seahawks were able to score sure the bengals special teams might have allowed the return to go past the 40 but the momentium had changed and kicking it out of bounds just takes all that away graham couldnt tie his shoe in a critical situation
5335628 graham who was injured in the bengals third preseason game booted an ugly ball that fell well short of the goal posts and into the hands of safety ed reed graham who appeared to be fine prior to the kick limped off the field slammed his helmet to ground and fell to the ground as though he just got crushed by ray lewis
5335629 two more punts before graham somehow was able to kick a 40 yard field goal after being exhausted from the field goal attempt graham makes a poor effort to tackle kick returner b j sams sams returns it to the bengals 41 while graham lays out on the sideline as if he just collapsed after running in the boston marathon
5335630 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5335631 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5335632 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5335633 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5335634 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5335635 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5335636 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5335637 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5335638 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5335639 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5335640 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5335641 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5335642 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing
5335643 six russian armoured vehicles are heading from khashuri towards sachkhere and another six towards borjomi
5335644 if someone thinks they can kill our citizens kill soldiers and officers fulfilling the role of peacekeepers we will never allow this
5335645 anyone who tries to do this will receive a shattering blow
5335646 lets then start thinking negotiating how can we prevent the definitive estrangement of our two countries lets resolve problems through civilised methods
5335647 i feel relief i believe i made it but i didnt think i did when i crossed the line and then i saw my name with a q for qualified beside it and that was thank god for that
5335648 as for my next goal i have to go back to the track and figure that out
5335649 i was warming up brilliantly but got out there and didnt have it but i had something because i got through to the final
5335650 i am still rusty for some reason i thought i was going to hit in that race but thank god it was much faster than the heat and it pulled me through
5335651 all morning i was worried and then this afternoon i said i was going to make it and when i have that good feeling i come through
5335652 i am happy the hurdles are coming up in australian athletics we need a bit of a boost and i am glad to help out
5335653 i knew i had to come out hard and unless i ran a pb i would not have made it through the rounds i ran really quick so i am happy with that
5335654 ha experimentado una favorable evoluci n en su estado de salud
5335655 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5335656 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5335657 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5335658 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5335659 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5335660 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5335661 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5335662 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5335663 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5335664 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5335665 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5335666 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5335667 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5335668 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5335669 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5335670 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5335671 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5335672 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5335673 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5335674 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5335675 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5335676 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5335677 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5335684 this directive is a direct contradiction and violation to the chinese own constitution and very troubling to hear while the olympic games are still taking place in beijing
5335685 the four groups on the clampdown list are not the threat to chinas society and to target these vulnerable social groups who deeply care about freedom and rights raises serious doubts about chinas pledge for a harmonious society
5335686 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5335687 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5335688 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5335689 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5335690 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5335691 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5335692 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

5335720 we should have a new album out at the end of the year or january

5335723 theres some strange topics of songs a lot better than your usual themes of love hate glass smash is about a couple throwing glasses at each other after a night out
5335724 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5335725 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5335726 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5335727 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5335728 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5335729 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5335730 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
5335731 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5335732 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha
5335733 every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her
5335734 its the most normal thing in the world theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing
5335735 have somebody stand up for somebody have me as a man who ended a relationship stand up for somebody write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated woman ive ever met people are different people have different chemistry they have different lives its not about years its about going out with somebody being truthful on the way in being truthful in the middle and being truthful on the way out youre either a cheater or you break up and im not the first im the second one and thats it theres no lying theres no bullshit i just dont want to be followed around ny city like an animal
5335736 why did you ask me that question im being as honest as i can possibly be and youre asking questions that belie what im saying
5335737 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right

5335741 it was a near perfect laboratory test sen obama flunked

5335755 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
5335756 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
5335757 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
5335758 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
5335759 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders
5335760 they have been helpful in the asthma and diabetes areas with excellent implementation

5335773 its one of those things that are more complicated than it seems at first blush said allen fishbein director of housing and credit policy for the consumer federation of america
5335774 consumers have to make sure they understand the credit thoroughly
5335775 breaking the log jam of unsold homes is something we are very much behind
5335776 it will help chip away at inventory levels stabilize prices and spur sales activity
5335777 buyers flocked to market and cleared out a then record inventory of homes
5335778 the 7 500 reserve will make borrowers less likely to fall into default
5335779 its not going to provide first time home buyers with cash up front
5335780 you have to apply to get the credit after the fact theres a delay before you get the financial advantage
5335781 consumers have to have their eyes open about how this works
5335782 given the economy it will only push a precious few first time home buyers over the edge right now
5335783 the challenge right now is as much willingness to buy as affordability
5335784 the market still has this psychological barrier because people think prices will be lower tomorrow i dont think this can overcome that barrier
5335785 we have to be careful because these 16 players in both men and womens division have prepared for this event
5335786 if you win in the first round you have a 50 percent chance of winning a medal
5335787 if their performance is up to the level we have a good fight if they win in the first round they will be more composed to fight in the next rounds all the way to final
5335788 the draw of tshomlee very good the draw for toni not bad
5335789 on fight day some will be strong depends on the mindset but his korean training very good now he can win gold
5335790 it appears that several milf sub commanders are not controlled by the milf leadership and are just using the peace process as a blanket to launch violent attacks against the people of mindanao
5335791 these developments are clear manifestations of the insincerity to the peace process of a significant portion of the milf
5335792 virtual declaration of war against the duly constituted authority which was confirmed by commander bravos declaration of jihad or holy war
5335793 the afp shall not allow this to go on we cannot allow ambuscades arson kidnapping hostage taking blocking of main highways and other atrocities to be perpetrated by the milf against the filipino people
5335794 in fact our troops are already on the ground as early as dawn monday morning they are heavily engaged in these areas and we are confident that we can restore normalcy and we can take drastic action against these groups
5335795 is the leadership of the milf really in control over their field commanders
5335796 clarify if their field commanders still obey their chain of command
5335797 how can we proceed with the peace talks if the top officials of the milf cannot control their field commanders who are apparently acting on their own
5335798 very bad sign that the milf chain of command is breaking apart
5335799 we really have to know first from the milf leaders if they are still in control those who are out of line should be relieved from their posts and should be punished by the milf leadership for breaking the chain of command
5335800 these attacks should be condemned by everyone including the leaders of the milf these acts of criminality and terrorism by rebel muslim groups should be dealt with quickly and met frontally with the full force of the law
5335801 the government and our armed forces cannot afford now to deal with this kind of situation with kid gloves we want peace but when terrorism is the result of peace negotiations the terrorists must be stopped and subdued at all cost
5335802 even the top leaders of the milf should not let this incident pass this is an insult to their leadership clearly commander bravo is not inclined to respect the milf chain of command and this is a very serious offense in any military organization
5335803 we have put our men on high alert and we have been constantly assessing and checking every detail of the security measures that we have so far implemented
5335804 we have been closely watching the developments in other areas in mindanao as well as whatever movements there would be in these known milf camps here and we make sure that there would not be any spillover of these clashes in our region
5335805 here in the region it is relatively peaceful the only problem i had was the one in maasim
5335806 we know that these attacks in lanao and sarangani were just diversionary for them milf to be able to launch a major offensive in north cotabato

5335810 convinced that a plausible case can be made that congress intended incorporation of most of the rights in the first eight amendments
5335811 although many scholars have confidently claimed overwhelming historical evidence for or against incorporation i am not in that camp the evidence is sketchy inconclusive and subject to various plausible interpretations the riddle will not go away because no one has solved it
5335812 of the intended meaning before ratification binds the states to that meaning
5335813 one must be satisfied that congress clearly publicly and candidly conveyed to the country the entire country not just the east coast its intent to impose the first eight amendments on the states
5335814 concedes that evidence of any strong public awareness of nationalizing the
5335815 remain s unsure if there is enough evidence to show a clear communication to the states and the country
5335816 radically change the whole theory of the relations of the state and federal governments to each other and of both these governments to the people
5335817 no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states including those defined in the first eight amendments to the constitution
5335818 twitchell claimed that pennsylvania failed to follow the sixth amendment command that he be informed of the specific nature of the accusation so as that he might be enabled to prepare for a defence and that the failure to comply with the sixth amendment meant that the warrant for his execution was not a due process of law in a unanimous opinion written by chief justice salmon p chase the court refused to reach the merits of the appeal because it lacked jurisdiction to hear a case from a state court about the scope of the fifth and sixth amendments
5335819 oh by the way the sixth amendment applies to the states through the fourteenth
5335820 rather shocking but by no means unique indication of the inalertness of the men who composed the court of the period
5335821 twitchell is perhaps explicable as an unthinking reflection of the notion that section 1 would have its main application in the southern states
5335822 many informed men simply were not thinking carefully about the words of section one at all
5335823 its crazy bed bath amp beyonds market cap is bigger than gms
5335824 whether it was voting against or voting present on issues related to stricter penalties on offenders of serious crimes or disallowing citizens to exercise their right to self defense obama demonstrated poor judgment on an important issue to his constituents
5335825 john mccain voted to keep cop killer bullets on the street and opposed the bipartisan crime bills of the early 90s that led to the hiring of thousands of police officers and helped communities stay safe a record that he will have to explain
5335826 second amendment protects an individuals right to own a firearm and he also believes as the supreme court recognized that both the federal government and local communities can adopt reasonable safety measures
5335827 i know of no time when he spoke out against the chicago gun ban
5335828 if you can ratchet back the firepower then you really can do something about the level of violence in urban areas
5335829 the best thing the senate could do is give out more money for more cops
5335830 john mccain voted against these fiscally reckless proposals because americans should expect that their government can fund law enforcement priorities by eliminating the billions in wasteful spending that occurs every year not by further increasing the tax burden on american families
5335831 neither of them have a plan to reduce urban crime

5335847 the obvious application for this spectrum is for internet connectivity everywhere all the time
5335848 remember that fuzzy static between channels on the old tvs
5335849 today more than three quarters of those radio airwaves or white space spectrum are completely unused
5335850 so we took it upon ourselves to take advantage of that and go get it ourselves
5335851 white space opens that up it drops the cost of end user equipment it increases the ability of us to broadcast to not have intermediate repeating towers to support going through a grove of trees
5335852 because expanded access to the internet hopefully means more users using google and the more users using google means more people hopefully clicking on the ads
5335853 our greatest desire is to maintain a consistent testimony for christ in all of the issues of life and in this circumstance we feel that a strong spirit of cooperation best accomplishes this

5335857 we are the first kind of mainstay in the u s
5335858 they view this as kind of their launching point to become much more active in the u s side of things
5335859 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects there is now a distinct possibility of technical recession the level of uk unemployment is likely to increase to nearly 300 000 over the next few years reaching almost two million an increase above two million cannot be ruled out
5335860 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5335861 the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
5335862 whilst a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate

5335864 once youre overseas you can just go from country to country we know that some of the most high risk offenders do that
5335865 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5335866 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses
5335867 they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5335868 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me
5335869 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5335870 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5335871 as president i will do all that is in my power to ensure that those who serve today and those who have served in the past have access to the highest quality health mental health and rehabilitative care in the world
5335872 and i will not accept a situation in which veterans are denied access to care on account of travel distances backlogs of appointments and years of pending disability evaluation and claims we should no longer tolerate requiring veterans to make an appointment to stand in one line for a ticket to stand in another

5335890 this was a tragic incident a family member can never be replaced and it is always painful when civilians particularly women and children are involved
5335891 the taliban use tactics in which they cause civilian life to be at risk they the taliban have no regard for the afghan people and support for the taliban in helmand is reducing
5335892 commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5335893 the announcement by president musharraf that he is standing down as president brings to a close a critical period in pakistans history and its relations with the uk and other countries
5335894 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential for britains security never mind the personal ties that bind nearly one million british people to pakistan that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and programme for thorough going reform of its social political and economic structures
5335895 the uk will remain strongly committed to its partnership with the pakistani people notably through our aid programme we will also continue to deepen our security co operation with the new government
5335896 in the last few years the market for personal loans has been extremely competitive as lenders and borrowers alike cashed in on the availability of cheap credit increased competition pushed prices down and lenders continually undercut each other in order to top best buy tables
5335897 this is extremely bad news for consumers who may be considering consolidating existing debts to try to drive down their monthly expenditure

5335977 im on unpaid leave but its worth it there are so many people who have no chance to watch the games
5335978 but its all about the atmosphere i just wanted to bring them here and surely they know about liu xiang and the hurdles
5335979 not bad i feel really terrible about liu xiang though
5335980 i am shocked by this senseless and barbaric attack on one of our staff
5335981 ive won two races and darrens won the other so its been a good day for the team
5335982 its a shame my weekend ended in a tyre wall i made a forceful touring car move on tom which was needed because from where i was sitting it looked like he was under instructions not to let me past at any cost either something broke on his car and thats forced him into me or hes maliciously had me off
5335983 its certainly great to have won again and it was also a great day for seat winning all three races
5335984 race one was a disappointing way to start the day but it was a great way to finish it i also had a lot of fun in race two coming through from the back of the field and to break a two year old lap record is a good feeling too next stop is silverstone at the end of august and i always really enjoy racing there as its my home circuit
5335985 first and second here at audis place after le mans it feels good winning here the nurburgring is always a nice track for me in the past i won quite a lot here now is the time to party a bit but then think about the next race audi showed us at le mans that to be fastest is not enough
5335986 we always want to win but the main objective was first and second place for peugeot
5335987 we had some problems with the starter motor which cost us time in the pits and the traffic was very difficult i lost around 15 to 20 seconds with a lola which to me was too much

5335989 the long term economic potential of latin america makes this an extremely important market for video games
5335990 nintendo has experienced phenomenal growth in the region over the past few years growth that has even surpassed what we have seen in the united states
5335991 it is extremely difficult to predict where prices will go from here but if they keep going as they have the average should drop below 4 tomorrow
5335992 as to why this region is the second highest in the state we arent really sure but there are a number of things high taxes in the buffalo area and the possibility that local retailers may have bought more gas on the futures market when it was higher in price
5335993 as the futures market goes down we should see the price at the pump drop even further
5335994 people of wacken are you ready to kill each other

5335998 the trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt
5335999 continued open border policies along with violation of the rule of law will destroy all of america and all republics around the world how do we object to this takeover to whom do we cry out why isnt each states sheriff or attorney general calling forth the militia of the several states to close our borders deport all illegals stop the drug trade and coyotes bringing in more vermin to whom do we go to protect us my guess is keep your best friend ready oiled and loaded thanks
5336000 you guys seem to get down primarily on mexicans and other latinos how come i never see you complaining about the various europeans that come here
5336001 i heard you on coast the other night and you were excellent
5336002 just to add my own two cents id like to say that i dont see much hope of stopping what is going on regarding the illegal alien situation
5336003 also one cant overlook the fact that europeans stole the land
5336004 my own personal solution is to not have any kids
5336005 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5336006 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5336007 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5336008 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5336009 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5336010 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5336011 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5336017 im puzzled i stay up late at night thinking about how we can get our offense going
5336018 ill listen to what anybodys got to say fans cab drivers president bush anybody
5336019 unfortunately our offense is putting a lot of pressure on them
5336020 hopefully our pitchers wont try to do too much they have to keep doing what theyre doing and let our offense come around its nice to win a game 1 0 like we did the other night but you cant rely on that all the time if our pitchers give up three runs in a game we need to win that game no one saw this coming and no one saw us struggling offensively for this long
5336021 the only thing about the pitching staff is they dont hit enough homers
5336022 they could hit a home run or two a game and give us a better chance to win not necessarily homers but a few hits a game wed have a better chance to win
5336023 the pitching has been better than i thought it was at the start of the season but at the same time if we hadnt hit then we wouldve been in deeper our bullpen has been good and our rotation has been better than i thought but we cant get consistency on nights when we have pitching we dont have hit on nights when we dont hit we have pitching
5336024 if we dont win its our fault because were definitely capable of winning our division
5336025 we definitely can control our destiny with 39 games to go the team that gets hot is the team that can claim our division we have to stay with them and play consistent
5336026 the more i think about my goal in life the more vivid my goals become
5336027 whether it is exploding prisons or freeing them somehow i know i have to play a role in it let it be a martyrdom operation

5336053 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy

5336080 the coach called me up to help the team i feel a bit of pressure because the expectations are higher of me than they are of the younger boys but i am doing my best however i believe that if you work hard you wont have a bad day and the results will come
5336081 weve improved a lot which you can tell by looking at our results
5336082 we didnt score in the first game in the second and third games we won 2 1 and in the quarter final we still scored two but kept a clean sheet i was pleased that we did that because it showed that we were strong and organised and that wed taken a step forward from the usa and japan matches
5336083 were still looking for our game we know we have to work defensively but it is in our instinct to go forward and look to score thats why in the past weve left gaps at the back which the coach hasnt been pleased about however the fact has been stressed to us we have to be organised and play as a team if we are going to be successful
5336084 they have a real quality and the result against italy speaks for itself

5336102 our sales results for the quarter while better than our forecast reflect the realities of the continuing macro economic pressures on our industry
5336103 we believe our second quarter sales benefited from the economic impact of the fiscal stimulus tax rebates unfortunately weakness in bigger ticket projects continues particularly in markets most impacted by the housing downturn
5336104 the macro economic factors pressuring consumers and the ongoing challenges and uncertainty of the financial markets suggest a cautious sales forecast for the balance of fiscal 2008 is prudent

5336112 given the current uncertainties in the economy including unprecedented declines in real estate valuations in our markets it is prudent for us to retain more capital in this environment
5336113 the ratings downgrade reflects our concern that the company will violate the financial covenants established in its credit agreement in the near term despite having previously amended its covenants in march 2008

5336118 while we continue to believe the longer term strategic direction of the company is indeed the right strategy we are equally concerned about the macro trends and the impact on the teen shopper
5336119 while the shares could take a hit if numbers come down we believe that most investors should be expecting lowered numbers across the sector for the second half of 2008 so this expectation could mitigate downside
5336120 a capital raise would allow the company to resume loan growth taking advantage of the current lack of competition in its markets
5336121 accelerated loan growth would provide upside to our earnings per share estimates and could cause us to become more constructive on the stock

5336211 reduce your withdrawals to x as soon as the portfolio value drops to y of its original value
5336212 looks like it was a good toss to lose but i would have still batted if i had won the toss
5336213 first 45 minutes would always have been tough but if you have got through that period and got 225 runs on board it would have been a much tougher score to chase down on this
5336214 it was not easy wicket even when we were batting it was not easy with the new ball but we managed to get through which is the most important
5336215 it was a very good one day wicket because with the new ball it wicket is going to do a bit there is a bit bounce on it there is a bit of dew for the first eight overs maximum but after that there is a seam moment but that seam was there when we were batting
5336216 when we started the game we did not expect it like this to win easily i take it that it is important to start well when you start a five match series i thought we bowled very well hit the right areas kept lot of pressure on indian batsmen and created opportunities
5336217 i am happy with the start we got but then it is just a start we have another four games to play we need to make sure that we concentrate very well
5336218 there are areas which we can improve we just need to make sure that we pin point that and work harder it is not just about this series for us as a group we need to keep working harder
5336219 yes definitely they will come back strongly they india have got a very good side they will definitely come back strongly they have got lot of talented individual players who can just change the match for them we need to make sure that we play the same brand of cricket that we played
5336220 ich wollte heute abend unbedingt den weltrekord holen und bin so happy dass es geklappt hat
5336221 die 4 70 meter waren knapp aber ich bin mit dem siebten rang bergl cklich
5336222 ich hoffe ich kann in peking in einen russischen hintern treten
5336223 to start off we misread the wicket a bit we thought it might not seam or swing that much as the breeze was strong we expected it to swing throughout the day which it did but i think there was a fair bit in the wicket to start off
5336224 the sri lankan bowlers bowled really well the top two batsmen they got out not due to a bad shot they got out of their defence the credit goes to their fast bowlers i think they got wickets
5336225 later on ajantha mendis put the pressure and the only thing we were doing was to catch up and it really gets tough in the one dayers if you lose too many wickets upfront
5336226 if you see muralitharan and mendis they are different bowlers murali is fast he can turn on any sort of wicket he loves sri lankan wicket even when he bowls fast he gets some purchase out of the wicket
5336227 if it was any other spinner apart from murali and mendis they wont have got so much turn you can say there was a bit you can say but if you are in a good position then you can exploit that
5336228 he is a very different bowler and even if you pick him up by the time you realise what bowl it is it gets late to play a big shot
5336229 now a days you will see batsmen who can play him but in one day cricket it is not only about playing him you also have to rotate the strike because you do not want a bowler to end up bowling 10 overs and may be 20 runs
5336230 we need to find a way in which we can rotate singles if not play the big shot take singles take few from him mendis few from murali and look to attack others
5336231 you got to have something on the board you cannot really score 180 or 200 runs and look to defend that so you have to get a decent score for which we have to score from each and every bowler
5336232 it is important to get a good start because the two games that we have played against sri lanka when mendis was playing we were never off to a good start

5336251 they must all be very worried for the future and i hope that they find alternative employment soon

5336271 mark parrish is the exact guy that could have made a huge difference in the colorado series i know that he was hurt and so did everyone else if a guy that is considered a character guy goes out in a series like that and just leaves it all out there taking and delivering abuse while everyone knows he is hurt a team will rally around that guy suddenly you have guys like pav gabby skoula johnson butch and other players not known for being physical stepping that aspect of their game a little bit you saw it in rod brindamor with carolina in baseball you saw it with curt schilling with boston and gibson with the dodgers in baseball if he had taken that role he would have become a hockey god right there with neal broten in this state but instead when talking about home grown wild hockey players all attention will still turn to darby hendrickson

5336275 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief

5336277 as president i will do all that is in my power to ensure that those who serve today and those who have served in the past have access to the highest quality health mental health and rehabilitative care in the world
5336278 and i will not accept a situation in which veterans are denied access to care on account of travel distances backlogs of appointments and years of pending disability evaluation and claims we should no longer tolerate requiring veterans to make an appointment to stand in one line for a ticket to stand in another

5336290 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5336291 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5336292 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5336293 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5336294 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5336295 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5336296 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5336297 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5336298 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance

5336311 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5336312 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5336313 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5336314 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5336315 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5336316 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5336317 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5336318 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5336319 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5336320 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

5336327 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5336328 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

5336333 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5336334 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

5336344 next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt
5336345 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5336346 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5336347 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5336348 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5336349 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5336350 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5336351 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5336352 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5336353 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5336354 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5336355 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5336356 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5336357 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5336358 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5336359 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5336360 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5336361 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5336362 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5336363 all i can do is be me whoever that is

5336366 no hay otro objetivo que informar a la audiencia urbana de que todav a no hay cambios de fondo
5336367 agilidad en las propuestas a la secretar a de agricultura
5336368 los gauchos tienen una gran incertidumbre sobre el resultado de la campa a agr cola
5336369 ha cambiado lo gestual pero no surgieron cambios de fondo
5336370 el congreso est en deuda con los productores por falta de un proyecto de ley que considere la diversidad de producciones de escalas y de contextos geogr ficos y el gobierno tiene una deuda m s grande a n por la falta de una pol tica para el sector en los a os que lleva en el poder
5336371 no les est resultando f cil vencer las resistencias en el interior del gobierno
5336372 no se puede pretender que con un cambio de secretario todo empiece de cero otra vez
5336373 lo que se ha hecho hasta el momento por parte del gobierno es nada siguen haciendo diagn sticos que el gobernador le pasa al secretario de agricultura cheppi cortinas de humos charlas sin resultados sin propuestas

5336384 if someone is facing utility shut off there is a great possibility that the kids are not eating as well as they should that kids are not doing as well in school because mom is working a third job and isnt available to help with homework
5336385 whatever the need is for utility assistance the amount that is available is less than 25 percent
5336386 we definitely are seeing an increase in need for example early last fall in first quarter of the fiscal year applications rose 42 percent
5336387 we know energy costs are going up and we are very hopeful that federal government will recognize the tremendous need here in michigan and provide us with the funds we need

5336392 when israel releases prisoners it is not seen as a concession but as a weakness
5336393 this is a decision that broadcasts weakness and complacence with the current situation
5336394 prisoners are happy for everybody who is released especially if they conducted attacks inside israel and killed people
5336395 the government will make every possible effort for the release of prisoners from israeli jails
5336396 i was making sure the people were okay and there were no serious injuries luckily there werent because both the cars were really damaged
5336397 but i wanted to make sure it would be safe for the emergency vehicles to pull up
5336398 i was directing the traffic through so it didnt block up and all of a sudden two fire engines turned up and police cars
5336399 a copper came across and said youre doing a great job there jimmy and he gave me a high visibility jacket to wear
5336400 when officers arrived at the scene of a road traffic collision a member of the public did present themselves to offer their assistance in directing the traffic
5336401 he was issued with a high visibility jacket and helped to safely direct the traffic along the diversion
5336402 at no point was the member of public placed in any danger and we would like to thank him for his assistance with this matter
5336403 i told him was going to do the 100 meter medley next year
5336404 the main thing is staying motivated and trying to accomplish one goal and thats winning a gold medal

5336409 as soon as we got him signed i was waiting around to talk to him a little bit it s a great feeling to have another marshall guy here i went on the internet and i don t usually go on there just to see what the fans had to say he had good support here and from marshall fans so we ll see how it works out byron leftwich shown against buffalo in his first pre season game with pittsburgh is looking forward to the steelers third pre season game this week with ten days to get ready photo courtesy of steelers com leftwich is glad to be anywhere after being cut by the jacksonville jaguars after being a no 1 pick with the seventh selection in 2003 and starting 2003 2006 for the jags he was cut after the final pre season game in 07 signed later with the i gave myself a mulligan last year
5336410 the one thing about life is everything does not come easy everything don t always happen for you and bad stuff just doesn t happen to bad people sometimes they happen to good people too and that s part of having adversity in your life i m just anxious to see how i pop out of this be a part of this organization and help anyway i can leftwich missed games as a junior and senior with leg injuries at marshall possibly even costing him a run at the heisman trophy but returned to lead mu to the 2002 mid american conference title and a huge win over louisville in the gmac bowl he didnt have much time to get ready for his first action with the steelers hitting 5 of 11 passes but having three drops by the back ups at receiver who stayed late and ran an extra 20 minutes of passing with the former herd qb i got out there and played with two days of preparation and i thought i played as well as you can with two days of preparation some things like i wish i could have that fumble back but other than that it was good to be out there those guys helped me a lot and at the same time the more i get to learn the offense the better i will get out there leftwich is used to battling pain throughout his college and pro career plus battling the expectations of following mark brunell at jacksonville and now filling in for charlie batch on s team in pittsburgh it s never been easy for me you know that woody
5336411 since day one i haven t been given anything i have had to earn everything i got and this is not a different situation i have had some of the worst luck somebody could have in the last year and one half but i m here right now i have an opportunity to go out and play just going out and playing i know when i am healthy i can go out and play this game that s all i try to worry about whatever they ask me to do i go out and do what i can to help this team that s the way it has always been that s how i looked at it when i was the one the two or laying in the training room

5336416 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5336417 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5336418 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5336419 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5336420 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche

5336429 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5336430 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5336491 yet the safa appointed doctor says he is fit to play in an international fixture
5336492 because i cannot believe any doctor could come up with such a diagnosis mphela suffered severe internal bleeding and the entire incident constitutes a disgraceful insinuation on the credibility of sundowns
5336493 what in effect bafana are claiming is that we selected mphela to play against supersport allowed him to go onto the pitch and then withdrew one of our key players from a game that has an r8 million prize in the offing with a faked injury

5336501 its an old clich now but there arent any easy games in international football and we know that the dutch will be a decent outfit with talented individuals
5336502 technically theyll be very strong and id be astonished if they didnt play a very attacking 4 4 3 style formation so were looking forward to a good game ahead of yet another busy season
5336503 i was wondering if they might have switched me over to mobileme
5336504 a few weeks ago there was no access to the apple account at all for us
5336505 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5336506 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5336507 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5336508 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5336509 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5336510 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5336511 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased

5336516 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
5336517 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
5336518 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
5336519 missile defense washington and poland just moved the world closer to war
5336520 the signing now insures an escalation of tensions between russia and nato and a new cold war arms race in full force it is important for readers to understand the ability of one of two opposing sides to put anti missile missiles to within 90 miles of the territory of the other in even a primitive first generation anti missile missile array gives that side virtual victory in a nuclear balance of power and forces the other to consider unconditional surrender or to pre emptively react by launching its nuclear strike before 2012
5336521 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
5336522 us troops on monday july 14 began military exercises near the russian border in ex soviet ukraine and were poised to launch them in georgia amid tense relations between moscow and washington a ceremony inaugurating the sea breeze 2008 nato exercise was held off ukraines black sea coast against anti nato protests and a hostile reaction from officials in russia sea breeze 2008 includes forces from armenia azerbaijan belgium britain canada denmark france georgia germany greece latvia macedonia and turkey the us georgia joint exercises will be held at the vaziani military base less than 100 kilometers 60 miles from the russian border with a total of 1 650 servicemen taking part
5336523 this is a formula for an injection of us military and naval forces into georgia of indeterminate scope and duration it will certainly involve the presence of hundreds if not thousands of uniformed us military personnel on the ground and a substantial number of warships in the region the us is introducing this military force into a situation that remains highly unstable and combustible raising the possibility of a direct military clash between the united states and russia
5336524 our goal is to fill the heads of people who make websites with more ideas best practices and contact with our industrys leaders
5336525 were happy to have her and i think shes going to be a great player for us
5336526 as much as we desire to solve every problem we cannot spend more than what we have
5336527 we do not aspire to unanimity which is usually fictitious
5336528 this strategic area of fort worth has been underdeveloped for years
5336529 we hope to be the catalyst for continued redevelopment to the area
5336530 really changed our whole outlook and philosophy on how we build things
5336531 based on the points we did achieve i would say its definitely been a positive experience
5336532 i spent my whole career doing things a certain way
5336533 then all of a sudden you look around and its time to look at how we build things that are more environmentally sensitive
5336534 it just was not attractive from a consumer standpoint and we felt like it was affecting property values in the adjacent area in a negative way
5336535 its one of those kinds of things that you can enjoy being involved with because it actually needed to be done
5336536 its filling a real need its not trying to create a need
5336537 each one had their unique characteristics and challenges in terms of leasing
5336538 since we were dealing with so many different properties we had to have a much broader view of who the tenants could be and had to position each property appropriately to attract the tenant
5336539 i dont think theyll let this pregnant lady fly commercial
5336540 the market is an excellent servant but a terrible master
5336541 we are the canadian forces and our job is to be able to kill people
5336542 make the public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects of faction
5336543 is an action that cannot be recognised if we live under the rule of law
5336544 the only goal of the referendum is to divide mexicans
5336545 i believe the government is willing to invest political capital even in a mediocre reform
5336546 we had just discovered that you could make windsurfing boards out of fibreglass
5336547 you have to collaborate to win these games and compete when it is time to compete but if you compete and break somebodys trust you are going to lose the next time
5336548 with the internet you can compete more effectively by being open

5336560 one of the reasons andy is playing so well is that before the final round his wife takes out his balls and kisses them oh my god what have i just said
5336561 time would always be precious from now on hed fill every moment with the seasons hed found in his heart hopes like birds on a spring branch happiness like a warm summer sun magic like the rising mists of autumn and best of all love love enough for a thousand christmases
5336562 oh lord thy sea is so great and my ship is so small have mercy
5336563 death is no freedom from judgement on the contrary he doesnt even have to hear it
5336564 i can hear the philosophers protesting that it can only be misery to live in folly illusion deception and ignorance but it isnt its human
5336565 so mean i eat glass wash it down with gas

5336660 we are very proud to have once again been named as one of the countrys leading travel agencies in travel
5336661 online advertising and streaming video a solution that ensures content originators get paid
5336662 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me
5336663 a leader god has blessed us with at this time
5336664 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out
5336665 and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5336666 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5336667 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5336668 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5336669 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5336670 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5336671 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5336672 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5336673 the only problem is that there is no tipping in japan when i was in the us i would fold the dollar bills there and leave them as tips it was so much fun watching the waitresses when they went to gather the tips i miss doing that
5336674 i was just 13 when one of my best friends brothers was about to sign a contract with leyton orient but one day he was walking the streets saw a fight went over to help got stabbed in the back and was paralysed
5336675 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and his family go through we have to lend our support to this campaign you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again because of incidents that have happened
5336676 we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to so it is important we get involved in something like this
5336677 im delighted the fa and the england team are supporting are campaign warning youngsters about the severe consequences of knife crime you can only solve this by working together the england players are role models for this generation and i hope their messages have a positive impact
5336678 i went to the same school as stephen and i will never forget when the headmaster brought the school to a halt and said he had been killed there was a sombre and chilling atmosphere

5337087 there is a rapidly growing nanotechnology corridor developing here in southeast michigan and we look forward to working with oakland university to access and enhance those resources
5337088 oakland university is very pleased to have been selected to collaborate with octillion on this exciting project
5337089 our interdisciplinary approach and relevant faculty expertise was a major attractor as was our commitment to supplement regional facilities such as the michigan nanofabrication facility with our laboratory equipment specific to the needs of octillion
5337090 this agreement with an institution known for its exceptional ability to work with commercial partners further positions octillion as a dedicated player in the michigan economy and may soon enable organic expansion in the nanotech and solar portion of our growing technology portfolio
5337091 as we continue to develop transparent solar photovoltaics that can be readily integrated into the existing glass manufacturing infrastructure i believe dr qus specific expertise and the flexible nature of our contract will substantially increase the potential value of our research to octillions shareholders

5337111 to me that started to serve as a metaphor of our writing process and what became the album and our skewed interpretation of technology and trying to control it but at the same time not being able to
5337112 i think all of the lyrical content on every album weve done has been a direct reflection of whats going on in our collective lives
5337113 in the past theyve been about relationships that were going on at the time or a broader sort of socio economic standpoint and i think its just sort of the natural progression to eventually get out of the smaller pockets of whats directly surrounding you and start looking out at the bigger picture at non religious spirituality and the future and what is the point of all this

5337117 weve all basically devoted our lives to this project and it just seems natural to want do that to not spend four years making a record and then just in one day hand it over to a record label and give up ownership of it
5337118 ive loved the faint since i bought the agenda suicide single back in 2003 and wet from birth was definitely among my top albums of 2004 that was a period when i was becoming increasingly bored of dance music and bands that were attempting a dance rock fusion were mostly awful as the electronic elements sounded like an afterthought
5337119 the faint along with lcd soundsystem and outhud were rock bands that understood the dynamics of club music so it was genuinely exciting

5337126 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure

5337130 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5337131 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes

5337159 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5337160 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5337161 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5337162 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5337163 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5337164 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution

5337167 the one thing i get a lot of emails about and its just not just from evangelicals it about catholics protestants main theyre trying to understand it because there was some literature put out by the national right to life committee and theyre basically saying they felt like you misrepresented your position on that bill
5337168 well and because they have not been telling the truth and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe vs wade by the way we also had a bill a law already in place in illinois that insured life saving treatment was given to infants
5337169 so for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive and its an example of the kind of politics that we have to get beyond its one thing for people to disagree with me about the issue of choice its another thing for people to out and out misrepresent my positions repeatedly even after they know that theyre wrong and thats whats been happening
5337170 official legislative documents released this week show that obama in fact presided over a committee hearing where
5337171 there are major differences in state and federal bills including the fact that the federal bill included a neutrality clause
5337172 the obama campaign thinks if they continue to repeat their flimsy story about barack obamas opposition to the common sense born alive infant protection act that their thin explanation will become true the reality is that actual legislative records directly contradict their story
5337173 heres the truth barack obama killed the commonsense born alive infant protection act in the illinois senate and his campaign continues its game of hide and seek thats because his position is heartless there is no baby at any stage even born accidentally that he finds worth protecting where is his heart for the downtrodden when it comes to the most vulnerable human beings it is no wonder he cannot admit to the truth of his leadership as a state senator
5337174 says that they are really concerned about americans finding out the truth about obamas record

5337208 but thats not the case this year and it could get worse because of the sagging real estate market

5337215 greetings from dorchester the nations new vacation hotspot more than a dozen condos many in abandoned or distressed buildings have sold at sky high prices to buyers using mortgages designed for vacation homes according to a local housing researcher
5337216 theres the mysterious san francisco woman whose vacation dream spot apparently is the third floor of a run down triple decker on whitfield street in codman square she paid 339 000 for a previously foreclosed unit one that sold just a few months before for 65 000 according to real estate records
5337217 then theres the man whose vacation getaway just happens to be a floor below his own third floor condo after spending 340 000 to buy the third floor of 15 santuit st in codman square with a conventional loan he paid another 340 000 with a second home mortgage to buy the second floor
5337218 when hes on vacation he can go to the second floor said john anderson a longtime dorchester resident and housing researcher who uncovered the increase in vacation home loans
5337219 as hundreds of bank seized condos many in triple deckers sit unsold they are tempting target for speculators seeking to snap them up at rock bottom prices such properties are then flipped for big profits often in sales using straw or phony buyers
5337220 43 whitfield is just one example of at least a dozen cases where real estate speculators have turned to mortgages designed for second homes to finance questionable deals according to anderson
5337221 most of the condos were sold at well above market prices well past the 300 000 mark despite sitting in triple deckers or multi families with other units in foreclosure that could be purchased for 50 000 or less anderson said

5337267 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate
5337268 i dont happen to agree with everything either of the candidates teach or believe but they both care deeply about america theyre both patriots and they have very different views on how our nation can be strengthened weve got to learn to disagree without demonizing each other and we need to restore civility in our civil discourse and thats the goal of the saddleback civil forum
5337269 obama gave a very long answer to the question and did so by not saying anything hes also got the abortion numbers wrong within that as well as using old numbers you know that hillary clinton had debunked a year ago
5337270 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
5337271 i am pro choice because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually rather they wrestle with these things in profound ways
5337272 at the moment of conception i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5337273 john mccain without hesitation bang life begins at conception he gets it the judges that he would appoint he made it very very clear i think he also resonated with beyond the base to those who are pro life even within the democratic party i think it was exactly what needed to be done he said it exactly the way it needed to be said
5337274 senator mccain helped himself he just will not shake loose of his beliefs that hes held for a long time on favoring research on embryonic stem cells but as soon as tonight he hastened to the safer ground of the promise of adult stem cells as producing progress and disease research so he knows that hes on thin ice with that but on the larger pro life issue hes certainly presented himself quite properly as strongly pro life so that was a good step for him
5337275 i think that senator mccain closed the deal i think he made a clear contract between himself and barack obama many evangelicals will vote for him
5337276 i think the distinction that we heard tonight was clear was decisive was effective that would be muddied if he mixes the ticket in some way and gets somebody who could become the president in the event that something terrible would happen to mccain who would go contrary to the clarity the focus and the energy with which mccain came forth tonight
5337277 obama says he supports marriage between a man and a woman but of course he says he opposed the marriage amendment in california do you see some conflict there
5337278 you cannot square the circle as he is trying to do either you support marriage or you do not he says one thing by his actions he indicates another thing and that answer shows up the hypocrisy in his position on that issue
5337279 i think it would be more refreshing for him if he would just be honest about it and say he favors gay marriage
5337280 he cannot do that because the american people do not favor gay marriage and so he needs to keep twisting and turning diving on that issue and it is hypocritical
5337281 he said that he would not only support he would support states definitions of marriage the defense in his own state of arizona for example where he has been stalwart leader for marriage as a union between one man and one woman but he also made it very clear heres the distinction what john mccain said tonight is his position that he says that the supreme court of california was wrong
5337282 what barack obama left out tonight is that he actually publicly praised the supreme court of california
5337283 answers were sharp i think he has thought a whole lot more about leadership i was particularly impressed by his answer on people he admired he went right to general petraeus who did one of the most remarkable military campaigns in recent memory and i contrast that to senator obama who when asked who influences him the most he mentioned his wife he mentioned his grandmother those are safe nominations
5337284 he got energy he got obviously many more applauses from the people in the room but i say this with a caveat i think he won if he can continue with the kind of fervor and integration of issues and faith i think that he may be on to a new high in his campaign if he retreats to a place of not wanting to talk anymore about these kinds of things i think it will not help him so tremendous win tonight i think its a new chapter i hope it continues
5337285 if these guys want to look like prisoners whats the next step

5337324 mr robeson is hailed as mr obamas forerunner and goes to san francisco toronto and liverpool
5337325 before barack obama there was martin luther king and before king there was paul robeson the forerunner of lets hope the next american president was at the same time one of the most famous singers in the world and the champion of the civil rights movement tayo alukos portrayal of robeson is spot on in about an hour you learn everything about robeson but this is no dry history lesson rather a thrilling moving and marvellously entertaining musical drama alukos singing of robeson songs like ol man river and steal away is totally soulful and convincing just like this show

5337343 e una cosa che non riguarda pi solo postato da gianluca freda 07 08 2008
5337344 identificata pi di 70 anni fa come carattere fondante della vera scienza dal filosofo karl popper la falsificabilit stata sempre vista da molti scienziati come unarma affidabile per tenere lontana la minaccia della pseudoscienza il vecchio pensatore viennese stato acclamato come il pi grande filosofo della scienza da personaggi del calibro di steven weinberg vincitore del premio nobel per la fisica e il celebre libro di popper logica della scoperta scientifica stato definito dal cosmologo frank tipler il libro pi importante del secolo per i tempi cambiano la definizione di scienza data da popper stata messa a dura prova dallemergere di idee scientifiche che sembrano sconfessarla dai tentativi di comprendere la natura fondamentale dello spaziotempo alle teorie che tentano di descrivere gli eventi precedenti al big bang le frontiere della scienza stanno generando una quantit di idee apparentemente impossibili da falsificare
5337345 perci non ho problemi ad ammettere che per pervenire alle mie proposte sono stato guidato in ultima analisi da giudizi di valore e predilezioni personali ma spero che le mie proposte possano apparire accettabili a coloro che attribuiscono valore non solo al rigore logico ma anche alla libert dal dogmatismo che ricercano lapplicabilit pratica ma sono attratti anche di pi dallavventura della scienza e da scoperte che incessantemente ci costringono a confrontarci con nuove e inattese domande sfidandoci a sperimentare risposte finora mai sognate
5337346 gran parte dellattrattiva di popper risiede nella logica tagliente che sta alla base del concetto di falsificabilit popper la illustra attraverso lormai celebre esempio del cigno nero supponiamo che una teoria ipotizzi che tutti i cigni sono bianchi il modo pi ovvio di provare questa teoria di andare a verificare se ciascun cigno sia realmente bianco ma c un problema non importa quanti cigni bianchi si possano trovare non si potr mai essere certi che non esista un cigno nero nascosto da qualche parte dunque non sar mai possibile dimostrare che la teoria vera viceversa il ritrovamento anche di un solo cigno nero sar la prova che la teoria falsa questo il potere fondamentale della falsificazione la capacit di rendere falsa unaffermazione universale con un singolo esempio una capacit sottolineava popper che discende direttamente dai teoremi della logica deduttiva
5337347 convinto che sia tempo di abbandonare lidea di popper che sia possibile definire il procedimento scientifico utilizzando la logica deduttiva al contrario occorrerebbe concentrarsi su ci che gli scienziati fanno nella realt mettere insieme gli elementi di prova delle diverse teorie valutando la loro plausibilit relativa howson tra i principali sostenitori di una visione alternativa della scienza fondata non sulla semplicistica logica vero falso ma sul concetto assai pi sottile di gradi di credenza alla base di questo concetto vi la fondamentale connessione tra il concetto soggettivo di credere e il freddo sterile computo delle probabilit
5337348 a prima vista potrebbe sembrare sorprendente che un banale risultato matematico ottenuto da un oscuro ministro presbiteriano vissuto pi di 200 anni fa possa esercitare ancora tanto interesse riguardo a cos tante discipline dalleconometria alla biostatistica dallanalisi del rischio finanziario alla cosmologia
5337349 un saggio sulla risoluzione dei problemi nella dottrina delle probabilit
5337350 gli scienziati iniziano con lesame di una serie di spiegazioni contrastanti riguardo un determinato fenomeno poi vengono le osservazioni e infine la matematica bayesiana viene utilizzata per calcolare il livello di attendibilit guadagnata o perduta da ciascuna delle teorie rivali in parole povere essa mette a confronto le probabilit di ottenere i risultati osservati da parte di ciascuna delle contrastanti teorie la teoria che ottiene le probabilit pi alte verr considerata quella che ha ricavato il maggior livello di attendibilit a partire dai dati
5337351 le probabilit di ottenere i risultati osservati da parte di ciascuna delle contrastanti teorie
5337352 le osservazioni empiriche stabiliscono se una teoria va presa sul serio

5337366 we are doing something thats never been done in central texas and we should be proud of that
5337367 our schools are getting better but incremental change is not enough we need systemic change we all have a responsibility to commit ourselves to the future of our children
5337368 it is critically important that we all work toward the success of our students
5337369 graduates are made not born this community wide effort embodies the promise that all central texas students start school ready to learn
5337370 we created e3 alliance to foster systemic change in the central texas region to say everything we are doing is sort of incremental around the edges and its not going to be enough
5337371 if we want to build the kind of sustainable economy that we want to see in the future we have to vastly change the system and the outcomes we see from the system in terms of reaching the potential of every student
5337372 it is regional in scope no region in the state of texas has ever had a blueprint for change student performance has gotten better but population is changing we simply cannot afford anyone not to reach their full potential we cannot afford for anyone to drop out its a work in progress its not finished the responsibility belongs to central texas not any one district
5337373 these champion teams are the structure that were putting together to really execute and put into action the blueprint
5337374 the problem with too many names defining and identifying central texas dropouts 2008
5337375 over 90 percent of our jobs now require more than a high school degree but not necessarily a bachelors degree to have a world class economy we must have college ready graduates to make a graduate it takes being ready for college and a career
5337376 even with all the great things we are doing too many students struggle in math and science and too many of them never get their diploma
5337377 for the region to succeed all of our students need to reach their highest potential
5337378 were not pointing at each independent school district and saying they are the solution they are only a percentage of the solution
5337379 the political and central force of that idea of the healthcare district emanated out of austin
5337380 texas has one of the highest rates of uninsured when you have 25 percent uninsured the best thing you can do is get them covered by a plan in a clinic to get them care preventive care so they dont have to go to a hospital
5337381 data is preliminary but it looks like the increase in charity care for fiscal year 2008 could be as much as 29 percent over last fiscal year
5337382 the healthcare district is a very important cog in the public safety net and we value our relationship with them
5337383 the district is very supportive when we need immediate action without them we would not have that critical level of care
5337384 we need physicians so hopefully we can work something out and make it a win win situation for all of us
5337385 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
5337386 if you dont have a fidelity or whatever account we wont contribute to your account

5337525 i expected the downtown streets to be a sea of red today but not this kind of red

5337530 i dont know why we didnt make the move to the years ago
5337531 i mean we not only receive top notch player evaluations but we know which reliever is best suited to host an episode of the view
5337532 as part of our commitment to making great american ballpark the ultimate fan experience we have invested in significant stadium upgrades for the upcoming 2008 season

5337542 is warning our younger players of the dangers of getting caught between adam and a plate of chicken friend steak frankly its more dangerous than getting between a mother bear and her cubs
5337543 but being a leader is something ive done since i was 10 years old its a role that im used to just because i dont do it like some people would do it or want me to do it i cant help that

5337576 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5337577 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5337578 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5337579 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves

5337607 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5337608 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5337609 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5337610 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5337611 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5337612 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5337613 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5337614 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5337615 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5337616 im thankful that there are people out there that are willing to thank the soldiers and families for what theyve gone through
5337617 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5337618 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5337619 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5337620 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5337621 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5337622 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5337623 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5337624 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5337625 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5337626 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5337627 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5337628 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5337629 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5337630 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5337631 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5337632 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5337633 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5337634 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5337635 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5337636 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5337637 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5337638 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5337639 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5337640 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5337641 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5337642 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5337643 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5337644 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5337645 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5337646 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5337647 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5337648 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5337649 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5337650 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5337651 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5337652 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

5337655 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5337656 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5337657 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5337658 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5337659 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

5337696 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
5337697 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5337698 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5337699 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5337700 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5337701 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5337702 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5337703 to god be the glory great things he has done

5337709 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5337710 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5337711 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5337712 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5337713 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5337714 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5337715 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5337716 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5337717 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

5337756 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5337757 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5337758 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5337759 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5337760 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military

5337788 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5337789 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5337790 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5337791 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5337792 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

5337875 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
5337876 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
5337877 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
5337878 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
5337879 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
5337880 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
5337881 as wed expected in applying our model increased smoke from the fires created clouds rife with a more pronounced radiative effect rich with human caused aerosols that absorbed sunlight warmed the local atmosphere and blocked evaporation this led to reduced cloud cover over the amazon
5337882 and its encouraging to know the science behind our model should stand no matter the region

5337885 because of the reflective material on their uniform at first i thought they were a rescue team but when we asked why they were forcing their way into the sixth floor where we were seated they answered by asking us to lie on the floor
5337886 they kicked us as we went down they frisked our pockets and took our belongings they then left us under the watch of one policeman holding a gun after 15 minutes they were back he said
5337887 i switched off the monitors but they knew what they were doing one of them asked me not to fool them he knew the station was on he asked to be shown the ups which they then yanked from its fittings on the floor and took it away because of its weight it took three people to carry it down
5337888 they just pushed the door and walked in i knew they were policemen because there was no way gangsters could come all the way to our floor unnoticed

5337978 they can also share or act out sex fantasies people do it in person on the phone surfing the internet or through e mail instant messaging
5337979 however not everyone follows the rules and you may run across some porn before you turn 18 there are a few things you should know about the images you might see first of all many people enjoy pornography alone or with a partner as part of sex play people have different ideas of what is arousing and there are many different kinds of porn that appeal to peoples different interests
5337980 i look at porno sites but i got all as for my subjects people say looking at those sites affects your school work but since i think im not affected should i stop it if i should how
5337981 many people enjoy using pornography as a part of their sex play alone or with a partner
5337982 there is no correlation between using pornography and getting bad grades in school
5337983 although teenwire com does make the point that pornography is illegal in the united states for people under 18 and although the editors mention that some may struggle with compulsive access to this content overall teenwire com has painted a picture that pornography is harmless fun
5337984 children and adolescents are considered the most vulnerable audience of sexually explicit material
5337985 youth are considered a vulnerable audience because they a can be easily coerced into viewing pornography or manipulated into the production of it b have limited ability to emotionally cognitively and physiologically process obscene material they encounter voluntarily or involuntarily c can be the victims of anothers pornography consumption in ways adults are often more resilient to d can have their sexual and social development negatively impacted through exposure to fraudulent and or traumatic messages regarding sexuality and relationships and e can develop unrealistic expectations about their future sexual relationship through repeated exposure to fantasy based templates for these reasons and others it is illegal to knowingly display or distribute obscenity or pornography defined as harmful to minors
5337986 however this legal reality is rapidly losing momentum as widespread availability and accessibility of pornography normalizes illegal exposure
5337987 the information in the link while accurate could do more to address how the viewing of erotic material can affect intimacy and relationships
5337988 yes its cheating if it is a secret hidden from your partner
5337989 especially if it takes time emotional energy and sensuality away from an intimate relationship and the other person doesnt know why or what is going on
5337990 as a young boy of 12 or 13 i encountered outside the home in the local grocery and drug stores soft core pornography
5337991 the most damaging kind of pornography and im talking from hard real personal experience is that that involves violence and sexual violence the wedding of those two forces as i know only too well brings about behavior that is too terrible to describe
5337992 and i dont pretend to believe what john q citizen thinks about this but ive lived in prison for a long time now and ive met a lot of men who were motivated to commit violence without exception every one of them was deeply involved in pornography deeply consumed by the addiction
5337993 in over 25 years i have treated approximately 350 males afflicted with sexual addictions sometimes referred to as sexual compulsions
5337994 in about 94 percent of the cases i have found that pornography was a contributor facilitator or direct causal agent in the acquiring of these sexual illnesses
5337995 patrick carnes the leading u s researcher in this area also reports similar findings in his research on nearly 1 000 sex addicts as reported in his don t call it love he stated among all addicts surveyed 90 percent of the men and 77 percent of the women reported pornography as significant to their addiction
5337996 unfortunately parents are outsourcing their responsibility to talk to their kids about healthy sexuality to teachers the culture and sites like teenwire com without any understanding about the sort of misguided messages that our children are hearing
5337997 the military have a feeling the operation isnt over yet they feel psychologically insecure about going away and are therefore searching for reasons to linger
5337998 the urgency which made the russian side launch a military operation in south ossetia without informing brussels after georgia attacked tskhinvali proved larger than the russia nato council format although moscow proposed an immediate calling of the council after the hostilities entered their active phase
5337999 russia nato cooperation in nuclear and non proliferation policy is in no way connected with developments in georgia and it is clear that such cooperation should continue
5338000 even in the most difficult years of the cold war the u s s r and the west carried on disarmament talks and reached serious agreements
5338001 a certain psychological and ideological overreaction upon the completion of the active phase of the russian operation has been to compensate for the accomplished fact which now cannot be altered
5338002 the deployment of new missile defense elements in europe has the russian federation as its aim
5338003 the purpose of deployment of missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic is forming a belt around russia and stepping up military and political pressure on us
5338004 the u s reasoning about protecting europe from iran and north korea upon its allies request is absurd
5338005 poland wanted the u s to help improve its air defense facilities and it got what it wanted
5338006 i will be paid at a normal international level there are bigger wages than that
5338007 the attraction of a political heavy weight should step up the implementation of the project the company is pulling through the legislative filters the only thing we need now is to commission the pipeline in time
5338008 the ukrainian authorities make such statements fairly often yet if the pipeline reverses to direct flow again there will be nothing to fill it with because ukraine needs first to agree with kazakhstan
5338009 it is necessary to reach agreement with russian oil transporting companies

5338015 the advent of laser application in urology has revolutionized treatment of prostate and stone disease in recent times most of the patients have large prostates with significant co morbid illnesses and several of them are on anti coagulants which pose significant risk to the conventional procedure of turp however because of the holep advantages all of them can have complete enucleation in single sitting regardless of prostate size and an uneventful amp quick recovery also so far none of our patients have required blood transfusions as the bleeding during holep is negligible unlike turp holep is also a viable option for patients with cardiac pacemakers as holep does not use electrocautery which interferes with pacemakers even during the follow ups patients have not had any problems with sequlae like strictures or bladder neck scarring which are seen more often following turp

5338042 wenn wir von der abgabenquote als ausdruck des staatsverst ndnisses reden m ssen wir uns zuerst die frage stellen welche aufgaben der staat hat
5338043 erg nzende aufgaben w rden aber im bereich des einzelnen und der betriebe liegen
5338044 es ist nicht gerecht dass 7 5 prozent der lohnsteuerpflichtigen 45 prozent des lohnsteueraufkommens tragen
5338045 nur 30 prozent aller australier tragen es im vergleich in sich jamaikaner sind beg nstigt und es wird noch viel mehr bolts powells oder frasers geben
5338046 ich halte diese geschichte f r dubios allerdings stimmt der ansatz dass sprinter als solche geboren werden und jamaikaner haben wirklich andere muskelfasern als europ er oder afrikaner

5338060 morally and philosophically i find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it and not only in agreement with it but in deeply moved agreement
5338061 wrote a play about politics and as part of the writing process i started thinking about politics
5338062 this is to me the synthesis of this worldview with which i now found myself disenchanted that everything is always wrong i took the liberal view for many decades
5338063 in my life a brief review revealed everything was not always wrong and neither was nor is always wrong in the community in which i live or in my country further it was not always wrong in previous communities in which i lived and among the various and mobile classes of which i was at various times a part and i wondered how could i have spent decades thinking that everything was always wrong we in the united states get from day to day under rather wonderful and privileged circumstances that we are not and never have been the villains that some of the world and some of our citizens make us out to be but that we are a confection of normal individuals living under a spectacularly effective compact called the constitution and lucky to get it
5338064 bush got us into iraq jfk into vietnam bush stole the election in florida kennedy stole his in chicago bush outed a cia agent kennedy left hundreds of them to die in the surf at the bay of pigs bush lied about his military service kennedy accepted a pulitzer prize for a book written by ted sorenson bush was in bed with the saudis kennedy with the mafia
5338065 oh and i began to question my hatred for the corporations the hatred of which i found was but the flip side of my hunger for those goods and services they provide and without which we could not live
5338066 and i began to question my distrust of the bad bad military of my youth which i saw was then and is now made up of those men and women who actually risk their lives to protect the rest of us from a very hostile world
5338067 classes in the united states are mobile not static which is the marxist view that is immigrants came and continue to come here penniless and can and do become rich the nerd makes a trillion dollars the single mother penniless and ignorant of english sends her two sons to college my grandmother on the other hand the rich and the children of the rich can go belly up the hegemony of the railroads is appropriated by the airlines that of the networks by the internet and the individual may and probably will change status more than once within his lifetime
5338068 prior to the midterm elections my rabbi was taking a lot of flack the congregation is exclusively liberal he is a self described independent read conservative and he was driving the flock wild why because a he never discussed politics and b he taught that the quality of political discourse must be addressed first that jewish law teaches that it is incumbent upon each person to hear the other fellow out i like many of the liberal congregation began teeth grinding to attempt to do so and in doing so i recognized that i held two views of america politics government corporations the military one was of a state where everything was magically wrong and must be immediately corrected at any cost and the other the world in which i actually functioned day to day was made up of people most of whom were reasonably trying to maximize their comfort by getting along with each other in the workplace the marketplace the jury room on the freeway even at the school board meeting
5338069 i realized that the time had come for me to avow my participation in that america in which i chose to live and that that country was not a schoolroom teaching values but a marketplace i began reading not only the economics of thomas sowell our greatest contemporary philosopher but milton friedman paul johnson and shelby steele and a host of conservative writers and found that i agreed with them a free market understanding of the world meshes more perfectly with my experience than that idealistic vision i called liberalism
5338070 how sad that an intelligent person like david would write such a simplistic downright infantile article filled with stereotypes and lacking any substantive insight whatsoever
5338071 does this mean that youve given up on democracy and thrown in with the authoritarians
5338072 im saddened to learn david is either a liar or a fool or both
5338073 mamet is a political ignoramus who hides his frustration by lashing out at an imagined liberalism

5338076 i did not leave the democratic party the democratic party left me

5338086 the march of the hurriyat conference and the separatists to the un office and attempts to internationalise the situation is unfortunate

5338089 the samiti is nothing but a proxy on of the rss vhp bjp and the hindu organisations
5338090 the responsibility lies with the bjp to rein in the organisation

5338111 theres a time when you make major donations to a variety of charities and political candidates and theres a time when you play it very low key
5338112 from a financial standpoint this is just not the year to support anybody
5338113 this would be an incredibly good thing to have democracy now aired in our area we really really need a progressive voice and a womans voice plenty of people in grand rapids would be interested in listening
5338114 id like to have the opportunity to listen to it here
5338115 in order to ensure that this station succeeds it needs to continue being a challenge to corporate radio
5338116 airing democracy now is one way to ensure that this philosophy continues
5338117 i know for a fact of other programmers besides myself who support democracy now being broadcast on wyce any opposition comes from a desire to keep wyce all about the music not so much any type of political disagreements with democracy now s content

5338142 youre either with them or against them sometimes youre both
5338143 surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon
5338144 the terrorists can win and quite often do and its global anarchy it sums up the randomness of geo politics pretty well
5338145 youre either with them or against them sometimes youre both
5338146 the olympic rush to sell sponsorships to the highest bidders has led to partnerships with companies whose products or methods of doing business betray olympic ideals junk food hawkers beer and liquor peddlers and equipment makers reliant on sweatshop contractors among others
5338147 this is the olympics the west wanted games where the grandest prize is not a gold medal but a glittering entree to chinas seemingly endless army of potential consumers
5338148 international olympic committee ioc the national olympic committees and international and national sports governing bodies scale back the overall number of sponsorships
5338149 to refuse sponsorships from alcohol or junk food companies or companies tied to gross human rights violations
5338150 insist that official sponsoring apparel and equipment makers disclose where their products are manufactured and ensure that their products are manufactured in a fashion that respects core labor standards
5338151 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5338152 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5338153 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5338154 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5338155 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services
5338156 last friday i spoke with workday a saas erp company ive been tracking since its start
5338157 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5338158 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5338159 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5338160 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5338161 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5338162 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5338163 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5338164 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5338165 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice
5338166 this is just like that one time i watched those girls show their ankles at the beach
5338167 global scale shared computer capable of hosting the entire internet as an application
5338168 it appears that they mnea had a considerable amount of influence it unnerves me to think that they may have a hand in determining who the principals are because i think thats clearly a management decision
5338169 any time youre in management its a very fine line between the respect and the like
5338170 i think one of the most beneficial results for children would be a beneficial relationship with the mnea
5338171 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5338172 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5338173 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5338174 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5338175 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5338176 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5338177 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services
5338178 last friday i spoke with workday a saas erp company ive been tracking since its start
5338179 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5338180 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5338181 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5338182 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5338183 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5338184 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5338185 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5338186 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5338187 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice
5338188 these wildlife defenders get so much out of it themselves
5338189 these are people who commonly have short term memory impairments and to do it fluidly and in front of a group is really hard
5338190 when someone has been disabled they miss the opportunity to contribute
5338191 the animals are a vehicle by which you can connect with the kids
5338192 its the right question to ask why doesnt obama have a much larger lead
5338193 according to our study only 8 of americans say they always achieve their new years resolutions the way it seems to work now setting a new years resolution is a recipe for defeat it has come to be one of the nations most masochistic traditions almost rivaling halloween in that respect
5338194 at some point people just decide to stop hurting themselves and they call the whole thing off
5338195 as we get older we get wiser and we identify things that dont work for us and stop using them
5338196 albert einstein once defined common sense as the collection of prejudices acquired by age 18
5338197 in this sense too many americans are using too much common sense when setting their annual goals why not this year as an experiment set goals that are chosen to bring joy and success in the new year instead of setting goals based on supposed faults or flaws that your parents or your spouse might want you to correct why not set goals that can lead to your own individual happiness instead of just conforming to the often misguided if well meaning expectations of others
5338198 these are all good areas to focus on in the new year
5338199 but the danger in this type of goal setting is that we become focused on where we are going rather than enjoying where we are right now we sacrifice today in the hope that a better future will emerge only to discover that achievement rarely leads to true joy
5338200 when most people set new years resolutions they have specific measurable results that they want to achieve
5338201 lose 15 pounds run a marathon quit smoking in doing so you become myopically focused and shut down other more potentially exciting possibilities from appearing in your life
5338202 for a colleague of mine this year is about service
5338203 serving others in whatever way she can to make a contribution
5338204 choose a theme that is expansive gets your juices flowing has you excited and moves you into action
5338205 i used to be a diet coke addict drinking as much as five liters a day every time i tried to stop i would focus on it so much that i would end up drinking more what worked instead of reducing my cola consumption i decided to let myself drink as much carbonated beverages as i wanted as long as i drank at least two liters of water a day it doesnt take that much discipline to drink two liters of water and by paying attention to my body and how much better i feel it positively reinforces the new behavior and helps me detach from the old now i find i rarely drink much soda
5338206 start your resolution setting ritual on the winter solstice of each year december 21 take time to reflect on what you accomplished the up and the downs be sure to really look at the powerful changes and experiences you had the key thing is to not beat yourself up in life we tend to focus on wins and losses successes and failures when reflecting on the past dont focus on whether you failed or succeeded instead ask yourself why why did you succeed why did you fail only through this reflection and through embracing these situations can you learn and grow and of course celebrate your successes
5338207 if you are in a relationship do these exercises together
5338208 use this as a chance to appreciate each other acknowledge one another for their contributions over the past year and jointly choose a theme that you want to pursue together in the next year this helps ensure that you are playing the same game regardless of your individual interests
5338209 it does not dictate a specific outcome and does not imply a particular path or plan write your theme on a post it note and stick it on your computer screen write it on your bathroom mirror put it anywhere as a quick reminder to what you are about at this moment in time resolutions are things to do themes are a way to be
5338210 themes are not set in stone if the theme you chose is not working feel free to change it themes are designed to help you experience life more fully you should never feel constrained or limited
5338211 i ran about the same time as the past three or four years 1 22 40 and this year it felt really easy my training is going really well
5338212 i found it hidden in a box under my mothers bed labelled voice
5338213 what i have learnt from here is confidence and how to speak
5338214 by stefan szymanski and andrew zimbalist brookings 2005 in the best interests of baseball

5338216 we couldnt have asked for a better dream list of owners
5338217 i dont much care about it as a form of cricket but as a business model its turned out better than expected
5338218 it is no longer correct to speak of the globalisation of cricket
5338219 we face the indianisation of cricket where nothing india resists will occur and everything it approves of will prevail
5338220 i think it would be fair to say that break even expectations have been revised forwards a year or two
5338221 it feels as busy as when the tournament was on
5338222 we must reject the cold war mindset of the past and resolve to work with russia when we can
5338223 i am very pleased to carry on as club captain this season
5338224 it was my first season as captain last year and although i am 31 now i am still learning
5338225 i really enjoyed the responsibility last season everyone could see that and i tried to do the best job i possibly could
5338226 it was a really positive experience and this season i have to use that and carry on doing my best for the team
5338227 its difficult to put into words what it felt like
5338228 its what ive been working for ever since i joined this club so it was great to get out there
5338229 i hope to get more chances in the team ill be sticking around for a bit
5338230 when we started negotiations with him he had got a strain in his left thigh in training with everton just before they went to america
5338231 the problem was that during the negotiations there was a break in his treatment which wasnt exactly advantageous
5338232 we werent allowed to treat him and he wasnt getting treated at everton
5338233 we started the treatment on him as soon as we could but that was five days after the incident and unfortunately that probably cost us a week
5338234 had he had continuous treatment i am sure he would have been fit for the hull game
5338235 but we do not want to take any risks as he could be out for a further period of time
5338236 it was just cramp i should be training with the team on tuesday
5338237 i am really glad that it is not a bad injury i am looking forward to joining in training tomorrow and getting on with playing
5338238 overall i am really pleased with how pre season has gone for me and then to get off to a good start in the first game especially with two goals
5338239 csm was one of the earliest companies in india to recognize the potential of engineering services outsourcing in the offshore context in addition to the technology leadership position that csm has carved for itself getting selected to the global outsourcing 100 is an excellent achievement this selection is a reflection of csms endeavor for excellence in the engineering space and will enhance the companys image as the best place to work and build a career in engineering
5338240 this recognition is a further endorsement for csm apart from customer appreciation and employee satisfaction it strengthens our vision of csm as a centre of excellence for complete engineering solutions to the global industry this independent endorsement of csm by iaop at a time when india is emerging as the next engineering outsourcing hub is satisfying and welcome
5338241 we have ignored our police force for several decades which has resulted into strain on our manpower we may have expanded in terms of numbers of personnel employed or increase in police posts but have not done much to improve the quality of the manpower training programmes like these will bridge that gap
5338242 when you will be posted at your respective areas make a conscientious effort to win the confidence of general public and be particularly sensitive to women folk and elderly members of our society
5338243 we at ggsipu have always believed in an interdisciplinary approach synergizing with the society and offering opportunities of continuing education which was probably missing from the university domain earlier this is the third kind of a training programme we have created for delhi police personnel and with the expansion of university we may be able to offer a full fledged postgraduate course in police administration for the officers in future
5338244 sub inspectors and inspectors are at the cutting edge of the investigation system and they must be well aware to book a person gather evidences and process the case for prosecution besides offering this specialized training programme in association with ggsipu we are also conducting several short term courses for the police force as well as have reviewed and revised the training material of our regular courses
5338245 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
5338246 larry and i will have a bowl of mueslix and a small shot of prune juice and be in bed by 9 oclock
5338247 well let people file by the bed and watch us go to sleep i think we can hang with the best of them until midnight
5338248 the whole problem of anointing a pastor the arbiter of a presidential forum or the arbiter of elections in general
5338249 news flash theres not a job on the planet above the pay grade of the president of the united states
5338250 the first four rows were completely empty we had no idea she was even on board until we landed in hobart and noticed the cars and she was allowed to get off before the rest of us
5338251 the kids were good we did not even notice them
5338252 well i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate and then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5338253 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever john makes
5338254 now you will discover the definitive truth about 9 11 and learn why even the most popular movies on the subject have failed to address the evidence exhaustively presented in this video
5338255 the early mission results point to an excellent start for the amc 21 spacecraft the satellite is performing just as we would expect prior to embarking on the extensive set of in orbit tests and orbit raising maneuvers to be performed over the next several weeks
5338256 we also congratulate arianespace for another excellent launch campaign resulting in the accurate deployment of the amc 21 satellite
5338257 concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition in the european economic area or any substantial part of it the commission said in a statement
5338258 using a maximum of 200 words please provide a recent example that demonstrates the following competency s
5338259 the battle will turn into clear cut jihad against the infidels
5338260 near strategic defeat of al qaeda in iraq near strategic defeat for al qaeda in saudi arabia significant setbacks for al qaeda globally and here im going to use the word ideologically as a lot of the islamic world pushes back on their form of islam
5338261 today we lack metrics to know if we are winning or losing the global war on terror are we capturing killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the
5338262 no talks will be held with anyone refusing to lay down arms
5338263 the worlds most famous store faces a very expensive strike our members keep harrods running they ensure the lights stay on the building operates safely and shoppers can get about the store it is difficult to imagine how the shop could function properly without them
5338264 it is very worrying that those workers who were not given two extra days holidays are in a recognised union while the shop floor workers who got the extra leave do not have a recognised union
5338265 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this
5338266 if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response we have all the necessary resources political economic and military
5338267 i can say for certain when the new year will come but i cannot give an exact date for the withdrawal of our troops from the conflict area yet
5338268 i can only say that we will not be leaving as fast as we came
5338269 lets hope that this is a technical slowness in getting implemented lets see the russians begin to pull back thats what wed like to see but we havent seen it yet
5338270 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5338271 if they call this a pullout then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5338272 we are aware that the georgian side can undertake provocative actions at any moment against our troops as well as the civilians
5338273 we cant rule out the use of slavic looking people dressed like russian military for provocations and sabotage
5338274 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5338275 breeding a deep resentment of us involvement in the muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement
5338276 no longer capable of militarily defeating the insurgency in anbar
5338277 their enemy did not defeat them but rather they defeated themselves were consumed and fell
5338278 the only card accepted at the beijing 2008 olympic games
5338279 in sponsorship its not what you have its what you do with it
5338280 we looked hard at whether its giving us a balanced portfolio
5338281 they want to show nothing is safe here if it isnt under their control
5338282 the goal is to create an economic and humanitarian disaster that will rebound on the government
5338283 the russians deliberately targeted commercial operations to inflict economic damage on georgia
5338284 dropping bombs on poti port killing people i dont see how you can connect that with south ossetia
5338285 the russians want to show that they are lords of the caucasus
5338286 being in a war zone wasnt part of the job description
5338287 he said if any of you touch a hair on any of my soldiers heads well flatten the whole town
5338288 they cleaned out a store we used for old clothes used underwear old socks
5338289 they also took a black and white tv set and some tins of motor oil
5338290 first there should be supervised independence as proposed by ahtisaari but it is known that kosovo and albania citizens are one nation who want to live in one state
5338291 ar k tara ve sadi g l elik enka limited irketi
5338292 if we need to have one symbol for all albanians our official flag could change
5338293 in washington i am paying a team of 60 people who are lobbying for kosovo in the administration of president george bush and in the u s senate and congress
5338294 the alliance for a new kosovo is headed by two lobbyists from the u s offices of jefferson waterman former vice chairman of the national intelligence council samuel hoskinson and former deputy assistant secretary for east west trade in the state department kempton jenkins this lobbying group will also act through its advisory body which includes former u s secretary of defense and deputy cia director frank carlucci who served as secretary of defense in the reagan administration and the long time president of the carlyle group a powerful military industrial corporation among the senior advisors of carlyle is former u s president george bush and until the september 11 attacks its executive board also included the bin laden family
5338295 can the country face more confrontation can the countrys economy face more destruction
5338296 the honor and dignity of the country will be affected and in my view the honor of the office of president will also be affected
5338297 we are facing calamity everything is expensive behind the government is his hand
5338298 when he goes there will be a new government and prices will go down
5338299 today according to the peace plan the pullback of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5338300 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5338301 if they call this a pullout then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5338302 we were in motorcade until 5 30 p m et then a holding room in another building with no tv
5338303 i spoke to my coach michael on the phone and i said i dont know i did wrong why i lost by a hundredth of a second
5338304 he said dear i watched the race over and over again you made no mistakes theres nothing you could have done to change what you did you swam your best time
5338305 i cant even imagine anyone doing that again i think hes definitely made history its going to be very tough for someone to repeat what he has done
5338306 i didnt even think id be in the next olympics in 1988
5338307 it means the world to me to win another gold medal i think i could have run faster though i went out like i wanted to its a personal best i havent run fast since 2001 this is the best thing that has ever happened to me it means the world to me keeping the faith im a really blessed individual to go through what i went through and be back on top means the world to me its such a great feeling i was the olympic champion in 2000 coming back in 2004 i wanted to defend my title but i didnt make the final i was a little disappointed then but at the same time i made the team injured i had stress fractures in both shins
5338308 we are the best three hurdlers in the world we proved that today im really happy with my silver medal all season weve been very consistent i was focusing on myself and the hurdles and going 1 2 3
5338309 i was fourth at the last hurdle came up third and i thought i had second i was pushing it im happy with third i wanted it so bad but i kept making errors i kept crashing hurdles i think it was three or four all three of us know what it takes to win
5338310 i came into the 2004 olympics just out of college i was very nervous and didnt make the final i told people when you make the final anything can happen i had a far throw and nobody else stepped up i won a gold medal i almost started to cry on the victory lap but i didnt bit i know ill cry on the medal stand
5338311 i couldnt ask for anything more than to come to my first olympics and get a medal a silver no less its beyond words to have people in there cheering for you i made a lot of jumps and im feeling it right now
5338312 they made me jump two minutes two minutes two minutes youre supposed to get three minutes
5338313 i was jumping great i had first attempt makes up until my pr so we went to a pole i havent been on except for a little bit in practice i walked out of the tunnel and onto the track and i started to cry it was just so overwhelming
5338314 i dont remember the start too much once in the middle i got my rhythm once i got my rhythm everything clicked thats what im excited about im excited as soon as i leave the stadium im going to forget it this race and focus on the final hopefully the americans will have a great day tomorrow
5338315 i knew i had to turn it up today to make the final you do what you gotta do i feel better today i had the flu im going to do what i have to do
5338316 besides kicking one of the hurdles it was a good race for me its time we take back a little track and field
5338317 i set the pace at the curve i was able to do that i feel like im in control right now anyone can beat people on any given day
5338318 i went out there trying to get top two i pushed it kind of close i accomplished my job and i get to run tomorrow top two is favored and that is the main focus because you get inside lanes when you get to the finals you just run as hard as you can and hope you can beat the bolt
5338319 we all let up we dont let it all hang out until the final or semifinal if you have to push it its all about advancing i didnt know how close it was at the end i just remember seeing people
5338320 i felt like i should have taken the first 200 a little harder im glad i advanced
5338321 i did feel strong i just tried to focus i didnt feel anyone around me im glad to make the final its anybodys race were all right there
5338322 deliberately and courageously exposed himself to enemy fire in order to prevent the enemy from assaulting through the kill zone and overwhelming his convoy
5338323 his selfless actions prevented the enemy from turning the tide of the battle and undoubtedly saved the lives of his soldiers
5338324 i dont remember much but the girl in front of me crashing and then looking and seeing bikes everywhere i stood up and immediately started to cry i couldnt move my elbow
5338325 there is nothing worse than not finishing i wouldnt have cared if i finished last with a broken arm but i needed another arm to climb those hills today
5338326 im going to stick around for the rest of the olympics and cheer the guys on tomorrow
5338327 i will be at the closing ceremonies i may just have my arm hung up
5338328 i was prepared for the heat in the run and bike but not the water which was really warm and that told the day for me
5338329 it was tough but this is the olympics and it is supposed to be tough i think thats why the feeling of accomplishment must be so much greater for those who are on the podium today
5338330 i had a great swim and i was with the top girls for the bike which was quite fast and then i started to feel cramps right away on the run
5338331 it was a pretty good race but my little chicken legs said nope today im not going for the 10k
5338332 i knew i had to get out on that run coming down on the last lap i had to throw in whatever i had left there is nothing like running scared i had to make sure i didnt leave anything out on that field i put every ounce of energy into this
5338333 for me this silver is like gold it means a lot to me
5338334 i cant believe i won silver ive gotten first many times today i got second but its great this was an incredible experience i will never forget this
5338335 you know yall were like let me get four tickets to the funeral hes still the hottest ticket in town
5338336 bernie always said that he walked alone i dont think that he was alone i think he was walking with jesus ill see you soon bernie
5338337 i used to do drugs i still do but i used to also
5338338 i used to have a crack problem but now i dont smoke it anymore hardly ever that much
5338339 it is not expected that the restructure will affect rmg connect s accounts or staff significantly in the uk however personnel and office location changes have taken place in other markets rmg connect has a worldwide network of 33 offices in 22 countries
5338340 hey guys come on ive got more where that came from
5338341 this is what its all about good friends great music
5338342 if all the animals on the equator were capable of flattery then thanksgiving and halloween would fall on the same date
5338343 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5338344 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5338345 at the precise moment in which that baby becomes a baby
5338346 i was very aggressive throwing the first pitch for strikes
5338347 that allowed me to go out there for the ninth i was just doing my job
5338348 without question this was his best outing of the year it probably was the second best outing ive ever seen him throw after the nlcs playoff game in 2005
5338349 every one of us on the starting staff tries to put up good innings and quality starts and hope for the best
5338350 we have been able to do that but unfortunately it hasnt gone my way thats baseball
5338351 i believe i can make it a fine painting of the dutch school but i want a raphael head in the middle of it
5338352 when you have an event that transcends popular culture the only place you can aggregate these audiences is network television
5338353 well i could run my samples on a gel again or i could resequence the construct or i could redo the mutagenesis entirely or i could digest with ava1 or i could re digest with dpn1 or i could try a different polymerase or i could increase the transformation volumes
5338354 stick with the other stuff and youll get it to work eventually
5338355 a successful system will not only improve the quality of the recycled polymer but it will enable new milk bottles to be manufactured with a higher recycled content in closed loop recycling systems
5338356 i appreciate the collaborative effort the bargaining teams made in confronting key issues facing employees
5338357 juan pietravallo was terrific today in midfield when he was playing basically by himself as an anchorman the goalie jon conway came up strong and big when we needed it most mike magee very effective dane richards when he came in and jorge rojas
5338358 i always jump with my arms up to protect my face if you jump with your arms down youre going to get hurt
5338359 i would like to see the review but i dont think it was that bad
5338360 probably a yellow card but i thought it was a little bit much
5338361 seth stammler was fantastic when he went to the right fullback position
5338362 theres still a lot of games to go but im very pleased were picking the pace up right now and were winning against two teams from the same conference
5338363 if you analyze the 90 minutes i think we truly deserved the three points
5338364 im very pleased with the team effort and hopefully we can continue like that
5338365 we have six adirondack chairs decorated by different artists in the silent auction
5338366 the piece don gorvett created for the 55th anniversary will also be auctioned off
5338367 a couple of people had seen the chairs decorated and thought it would be an extraordinary idea for a fundraiser
5338368 the first one i did was a real challenge for me
5338369 i wrapped the image into the slats so when walk around the chair you see it its a three dimensional piece
5338370 every year weve gotten a larger and more enthusiastic crowd
5338371 how dare they say that about a former prisoner of war
5338372 i was afraid that i would die before i saw him
5338373 the terrorist who killed my mother should have been killed not jailed
5338374 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan and respects the results of the election
5338375 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5338376 musharraf made the critical choice to join the fight against al qaeda the taliban and other extremist groups that threaten the peace and security of pakistan its neighbors and partners throughout the world
5338377 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5338378 our sales results for the quarter while better than our forecast reflect the realities of the continuing macroeconomic pressures on our industry
5338379 when the attacks started the mosques were almost supporting them we could not arrest 35 000 imams
5338380 but we are fortunate they started prematurely if they had listened to ayeeri maybe they would be in a different position
5338381 do you know who told us about them their friends
5338382 as you kill you will be killed and if you want to kill our women and children then the same thing will happen to you
5338383 most of you are too busy watching home and away and eastenders complaining about the world cup and drinking your alcohol i know because ive come from that
5338384 it gives you a sense of rebellion but you dont feel bad about it you are doing gods work
5338385 are not simply random plots by disparate and fragmented groups
5338386 have taken place because al qaeda has a clear determination to mount terrorist attacks against the united kingdom
5338387 i think after 9 11 my friends we should have told americans to join the peace corps expand the military serve a cause greater than your self interest
5338388 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5338389 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
5338390 i have to tell you up front both of these guys are my friends they both care deeply about america they are both patriots
5338391 they have very different ideas on how america can be strengthened
5338392 i was so obsessed with me and the reasons i might be dissatisfied i couldnt focus on other people

5338398 they achieved a revolution now the russians are coming in there in an act of aggression we have to not only bring about cease fire we have to have honor

5338400 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5338401 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5338402 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5338403 solving big problems are not going to be easy we are all going to think about how we using things energy wise if we pretend like everything is free we are betraying the tradition of america
5338404 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
5338405 i have been looking to be a martyr for a long time

5338420 i do a bit of reading while i have my meal im currently having a go at the origin of species by charles darwin not the most relaxing read i normally read something a bit less heavy like the mammoth hunters by jean m auel which was my last cafe book
5338421 overall the walk and the meal with a good book gets me out the office it helps me switch off for an hour and the change of scenery is welcome
5338422 id feel the day was much longer if i just popped to the shop for a sandwich and came back to eat at my desk like some people in the office do plus i get some fresh air all in all its much more preferable to a deskbound lunch hour

5338429 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
5338430 its important for us as a classical repertory theatre to have living playwrights in our midst
5338431 it helps keep us honest in our approach to the classics reminding us that our productions must speak to burning contemporary issues and the important subjects of our own times
5338432 weve been pretty consistent about this from the start all along we said that the model was dependent on getting their titles for distribution for christmas this year
5338433 it is now clear we passed a threshold and thats not going to happen with that it changes our economics and we are stepping away
5338434 we welcome ea into our formal process and look forward to demonstrating to their board the significant strides made by take two since they last undertook a detailed review of our business in early 2007
5338435 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate and undervalued world class entertainment franchises and our strong operational and financial performance
5338436 once we execute a confidentiality agreement we are prepared to schedule the management presentation immediately
5338437 i suppose they figured it was magnanimous to make the attempt and take two management recognized that this was its last and only opportunity to affect the outcome
5338438 i really expect the parties to reach an agreement close to the 25 74 price slightly above
5338439 i guess on one level it is sort of gratifying imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
5338440 but on another level it is somewhat annoying nehalem is not rewriting the book but rather imitating or photocopying our innovations
5338441 the market has shifted away from that performance crown its a nice halo to have and we certainly have plans there
5338442 but in terms of what really matters we exceed the requirements of the value and mainstream segments
5338443 our visual experience is two to three times better than our competitor

5338459 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5338460 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5338461 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5338495 emil called me tonight and said that he has been thinking about it for two years and has decided to retire
5338496 he said he will announce it at a news conference monday
5338497 emil called my son mike and said that hes going to retire
5338498 but emil has a history of changing his mind i certainly wish him well if he indeed retires he served with my father in the house he served with me in the senate and he serves with my son mike three generations of jacobs
5338499 emil really hurt members of his caucus by aligning himself so closely with gov blagojevich he really should have been looking out for the interests of his members rather than watching the back of the most unpopular governor in recent memory
5338500 it used to be that federal money to help at risk students was distributed evenly among all the states school districts but emil jones successfully pushed for that money to only go to school districts where poverty was the greatest

5338507 instead of progress in the fight against high level corruption romania is regressing on all fronts if the romanian anti corruption effort keeps evaporating at the present pace in an estimated six months time romania will be back where it was in 2003
5338508 in its first year romania has continued to make efforts to remedy weaknesses that would otherwise prevent an effective application of eu laws policies and programmes however in key areas such as the fight against high level corruption convincing results have not yet been demonstrated
5338509 statistically impossible to attribute to the coincidental occurrence of procedural mistakes in individual cases other factors than legal procedural considerations have clearly played a major role
5338510 the romanian judiciary and or legal system appears unable to function properly when it comes to applying the rule of law against high level corruption indeed more than five years after the start of romanias anti corruption drive the public is still waiting for one single case of high level corruption to reach a verdict
5338511 we are witnessing the transformation of parliamentarians into judges and of the judicial committee into an extraordinary court
5338512 many of the measures that were presented before accession to be instrumental in the fight against corruption have been deliberately blunted by parliament or the government immediately after accession all major pending trials concerning high level corruption started just before accession and only after many years of hesitation have now been aborted and are most probably definitely abandoned for all practical purposes

5338599 the cav was formally established in 2006 in response to the urgent need for the creation of an aerospace supplier park to support south africas innovative manufacturing processes
5338600 this supplier park is not only modelled on the successes of the local automotive industry but also mirrors similar international parks such as the silicone valley in california and toulouse in france
5338601 not only will the project lead to increased job creation but would also serve to accelerate the integration of small companies in the industry
5338602 the objectives of the cav include the development construction and full operation of an aerospace supplier park the upliftment of small medium and micro enterprises smmes and for the repositioning of the aviation sector
5338603 the cav has been designed to unlock the growth potential of the local aerospace and aviation industries where local original equipment manufacturers suppliers of components parts and tools as well as service providers stand to benefit equally from synergistic and economy of scale applications
5338604 the cav concept was not however limited to manufacturing but also offers opportunities in service related activities including logistics training and technology centres shared services and co ordinated education
5338605 in deciding whether to support the aerospace sector we were also acutely aware that technology and knowledge are crucial factors of production in modern advanced economies and those new technological developments can create platforms for further innovations
5338606 at the time based on discussions between government and leading defence and aerospace companies i committed to the implementation of support programmes to this industry
5338607 getting the scarves was very special for the athletes because we knew someone spent their time to make them especially for us
5338608 it is something i will have forever and i know they will be just as special to the athletes next year at the world winter games
5338609 were thrilled to sponsor this project our goal is to see 5 000 scarves donated its a big number but im confident we can do it
5338610 knitters and crocheters are dedicated and generous and are known for rising to this type of challenge
5338611 is that the scarves are knitted or crocheted by hand using delft blue and white super saver yarn because these colors were chosen specifically by the world winter games organizers

5338613 people are so excited about barack obama that they really want to see him in person but knowing nevada is a battleground state i know that he will be back in reno and hell put on a larger event for people to see him in person
5338614 add to the conversation because these are concerns shared by everybody
5338615 with the number of close call events that are occurring in mines and no follow up to ensure that proactive measures are implemented then it is only a matter of time before another catastrophic event will occur
5338616 i have serious cause for concern about my our ability to ensure key safety messages and preventative actions are being implemented
5338617 this has manifest itself in the number of incidents that have been reported the number that have been reported well outside the legislated time periods and the number that have not been reported but which have come to our knowledge
5338618 we are relying on the operators to fulfil the requirements ofregulations but are not able toconfirm these without site visits

5338625 there are many hundreds if not thousands of paint workers around australia who have been employed in the industry for decades
5338626 those people are most at risk of bunnings and nippon jointly destroying one of our local manufacturers if they go to the wall
5338627 theres a huge industry here that needs people buying their paint
5338628 bunnings advertise that theyre a good old australian business but they dont care they just do it for the buck really
5338629 when it comes to paint the majority of it is owned by overseas companies but at least they manufacture here so it gives people jobs
5338630 why arent they looking at local manufacturers there are plenty of manufacturers that will make it for them under their label and then its providing jobs in australia and its win win all round
5338631 we disagree with it being job negative and think its more job positive
5338632 damian bugg who was then the director of public prosecutions outlined very clearly very precisely why the charges could not proceed if youre looking at where an error was made the error was made within the dpps office
5338633 i think the afp has been a tremendously professional organisation
5338634 theyve had to deal with a large range of issues where mistakes are clearly possible but have been rare and in this matter in my view the jury is still out
5338635 the gap in the evidentiary chain was quite precise that there was no evidence at that time two years ago when the act took place that it is suggested assisted that there was in fact a terrorist organisation in existence
5338636 but the former director of public prosecutions was of the view that his officer in queensland hadnt identified that potential flaw
5338637 people got it if they were on the distribution list and i didnt additionally circulate asio material that was not my role
5338638 intelligence inquiries are for a different purpose theyre designed to warn and counsel governments and the information is collected in quite different ways
5338639 i was happy to hand it over because itll be in good hands and theyll look after the country
5338640 its also a great partnership in which private conservation and government are working together
5338641 the results have been spectacular far better than we ever expected
5338642 mammal numbers are increasing in every habitat type and seed eating birds like gouldian finches are less stressed
5338643 it still is a pastoral lease but most of the people i know agree youve got to look after the country to maintain the industry
5338644 it also exacerbates the risk that children with learning difficulties and poor social skills will be diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder that may remain with them for the rest of their lives
5338645 this risk is particularly acute for children from socially disadvantaged backgrounds
5338646 the diagnostic criteria for adhd over the past 15 years has been expanding and its now almost possible to diagnose one of my cats
5338647 parents who neglect their children arent evil or malicious people
5338648 they might be mentally ill or have drug addictions or they might be young and with no support but they are losing their children when they could be given a second chance
5338649 controversial position but its something that needs to be said
5338650 with the best of intentions and everybody involved has the very best intentions they have started to be punitive to parents who are doing the best they know how
5338651 often theres not even a strong likelihood that a child is at risk but the child will be reported to the department of community services
5338652 it used to be the case that parents who were in trouble could contact the department and receive some assistance no sensible parents would do that now they know they might lose the children
5338653 ive been involved in child welfare for 30 years and i dont like the things im seeing
5338654 the system is now very punitive there is a general feeling that child protection has become forensic and investigative and its resulted in a massive increase in the number of reports
5338655 its not sustainable somebody has got to have the courage to say weve gone too far its a basic infringement of peoples rights
5338656 best interest of the children should not always be viewed in opposition to the rights of parents
5338657 what the children who have been victims of violence and abuse will make of all of this in the future we cannot know
5338658 but they will surely wonder why a feminist of such fame as greer has come to the defence of those who destroyed their innocence and damaged their sense of self
5338659 we are not in the mood for failed leftist excuses for the rising levels of homicide femicide and suicide
5338660 dr greers panoply of protest slogans deployed as social theory was dismissed long ago by the research and policy community as incapable of explaining the present day levels of huge disparities in life expectancy morbidity and mortality rates and other socio economic indicators
5338661 while the burden of history is acknowledged in much of this work the everyday suffering in communities at risk is caused by a multiplicity of factors all more complicated than dr greer would have us understand
5338662 i think its quite presumptuous to say that you know what is happening in the minds of aboriginal men
5338663 all im saying is that unless we deal with the pathology that underlies it we wont get anywhere
5338664 we wont actually stop the violence we may even cause it to escalate
5338665 one of the most powerful pamphlets ever written in australia
5338666 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
5338667 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet
5338668 i will not get so drunk on november 3rd that i am unable to vote on november 4th
5338669 it has certainly made an impact it has also raised worrying questions about professionalism and integrity in journalism
5338670 the obscure we see eventually the completely obvious takes longer
5338671 we spent three quarters of our time on telecommunications issues because thats what was driving the economy
5338672 john kerry might not have fought back but i will
5338673 each of his co authors most of whom are also management professors will write or edit a small portion of the final text which is slated to be published by routledge
5338674 theyre organizing the vast effort using a wiki that lets participants see and edit each others contributions
5338675 and of course he invited colleagues he had met over the years
5338676 the practice has been called crowdsourcing a term coined by a wired magazine writer to describe outsourcing a project to a large group using collaborative internet technologies
5338677 chapter editors and others who devote significant amounts of time to the project will get a cut of the royalties
5338678 if each of us does a youtube video interview with a manager where we live in the language where we are well have a 1 000 of them in 90 countries
5338679 so leta is it difficult to live your life so that whenever you need to illustrate a point you have an anecdote from your personal experience

5338682 and holding off and then discovering that my first reaction was wrong obviously there are limits to caution if i didnt think so i wouldnt blog at all but still
5338683 the man who up until late 1969 was in charge of all the pow camps in hanoi
5338684 the owner of the vehicle has a lot of questions to answer where did he get the protocol plate if its not fake then who owns the special plate
5338685 this is the first time in the history of congress when the special plates are used to hide the identity of lawmakers even during the martial law years members of the batasang pambansa indicate their districts on their special plates
5338686 we are supposed to be public servants so why should we get special treatment
5338687 i really wonder why speaker nograles and the house leadership are reluctant to act on my bill

5338694 let me say clearly that i am not progressing that recommendation at this stage
5338695 that matter is not a priority for me but it is something that i will speak to my colleagues about
5338696 i think there are two reasons why it would have a big impact
5338697 first there will be stories that wont be able to be told for fear of being sued full stop the second one is the stories the media wont even know about or find out about because media outlets will be more reluctant to pour resources into investigative journalism
5338698 to expose sexual conduct that does not involve any significant breach of the criminal law
5338699 our regulatory bodies receive relatively few complaints of an improper invasion of privacy
5338700 if these proposals are introduced there is no doubt it will limit what the media can publish will limit investigative journalism and will result in the publics right to know being impaired
5338701 i think one of the myths is that this will undermine the right of journalists to access information and allow the rich and powerful to cover up the activities they dont want disclosed
5338702 i think the media can on occasions go over the mark
5338703 knocking on peoples doors at 10 or 11pm particularly those with families can be very very distressing theres got to be some limitation on it
5338704 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
5338705 in any contest between privacy and free speech i think we should err on the side of free speech allowing people to speak their minds has very good consequences
5338706 privacy laws tend to kick in when people have said things that are true its a fairly dangerous thing to prevent people saying things that are true my view is that we live with the law of defamation you say something untrue and you pay the consequences but if its embarrassing so what
5338707 i would copy nothing coming out of canada in relation to free speech
5338708 the americans have a pretty strong emphasis on letting people speak and i dont see too many people opting out of the limelight
5338709 we expect to get quite a few more fires out of this

5338720 it is widely believed that human beings are attracted to one another as a result of genotypic and phenotypic quality in other words their prospect as a mate who will yield higher quality offspring for the chooser
5338721 your body proportions shape and stature are signals that conspicuously advertise your good development or health and therefore the degree to which you are a desirable reproductive partner in many species fewer departures from perfect symmetry are associated with good development health and reproductive success
5338722 they are choosing individuals who would have evidence for good development which means that maybe their offspring would be more healthy and have good development as well

5338728 bushs erratic behavior and sharp mood swings led white house physician col richard j tubb to put the president on powerful anti depressant drugs after he stormed off stage rather than answer reporters questions about his relationship with indicted enron executive kenneth j lay but white house insiders say the strong prescription medications seem to increase bushs sullen behavior towards those around him
5338729 yes there are concerns the george w bush we see today is not the same gregarious back slapping president of old hes moody distrustful and withdrawn

5338748 pacific island countries have been very enthusiastic about inclusion in a pilot scheme of this sort and the prime minister has indicated this is something he wishes to discuss at the pacific islands forum
5338749 the pilot will be reviewed after 18 months to ensure it is meeting the needs of australian employers and pacific island workers and that the necessary safeguards are working effectively
5338750 we will also be very rigorous about the regime which applies in australia both in terms of meeting the visa requirements but also meeting by both employers and employees any obligations which are placed on them

5338752 lidea dellorganizzazione scrive la presidente nella presentazione sul n 101 di quaderni radicali nasce proprio perch ci siamo resi conto che non esiste una corretta informazione sul medio oriente di tanto in tanto i giornali pubblicano qualche voce democratica definendola per uneccezione inculcandoci ulteriormente che gli arabi democratici e liberali non esistono

5338762 the eu started with the community for coal and steel
5338763 i was looking forward to getting it over and done with getting a medal around the neck and then really relaxing
5338764 its been really stressful its a long event which im glad we got it over and done with and got a silver which looked a long long way off
5338765 when we crossed the line we were screaming and crying and shouting the feeling has not sunk in yet
5338766 this is our first olympic campaign i dont think weve even felt an olympic medal before
5338767 were going to have a buffet with lots of food we plan on getting fat
5338768 tonight we are going to eat a lot of chocolate because we have lost so much weight
5338769 that was the emotion that came naturally because i spent a lot of time preparing for this moment and i just couldnt hold back my tears
5338770 the play was very tough and the style is very difficult for me
5338771 each night here he and i have both gotten more relaxed
5338772 he always has energy hes really smart and always tries
5338773 you do what you can in a situation like that
5338774 i knew i needed to go clear or have four faults at the worst
5338775 i wish i could have sealed it but i wouldnt have ridden it any differently
5338776 you think you win you lose in my heart i hoped for it but thats one thing another thing is what will happen in the jury room
5338777 right when the mast broke i thought it was all over
5338778 he asked if i had the number of the danish team i did
5338779 it was just by chance that it was the croatian boat they used
5338780 we saw they broke the mast the journalist called we ran down and started to rig the boat
5338781 was completely wild i dont know how long it took
5338782 we snapped the mast we go in we take the croatian boat
5338783 we make the start with four seconds to spare if we had been four seconds later we wouldnt have been olympic champions and then the protest and the postponement of the protest everything is just unreal
5338784 everything was different and it was set up for light winds
5338785 we feel like were playing very well right now but you have to keep in mind its single elimination
5338786 shut up shut up cant you all just shut up

5338789 ive been writing 2 5k word thought pieces on the email list and ive found it to be very rewarding in a way that the mud pit of blogging a mudpit and does that make us bloggers pigs
5338790 now i still love blogs still read them still comment on them but im trying to find my voice again my true voice there is something about the acoustic intimate nature of email that is impacting how i write im writing every sentence as if im looking someone in the eye and speaking directly to them im thinking about the economy of words again im trying to say things in as few words as possible and im cutting sentences paragraphs and pages more than im publishing them im proof reading again and c k sample is proofing for me its a new slower and more considered process and im loving it ive published ten emails or so and ive thrown away at least 30 somethings happening but i dont know what it is
5338791 im writing every sentence as if im looking someone in the eye and speaking directly to them
5338792 im thinking about the economy of words again im trying to say things in as few words as possible and im cutting sentences paragraphs and pages more than im publishing them im proof reading again
5338793 over 100 folks respond to every email and i try to respond to every single person some of these emails are five pages and i read every single word no one else sees these words they are between me and the reader and that is also wonderful and true posting to the comment section of a blog is meaningless when compared to sending an email containing your thoughts inteneded for the author folks say very very deep true and honest things in one to one communications that they cant say in a blog comment i love that

5338812 he indicates he sees vehicles stopped in the southbound lane and he still doesnt stop causing the devastation we all know
5338813 i think there was enough there to charge someone with culpable driving
5338814 he was never a nazi never a member of the fascist arrowcross never involved in anything to do with the holocaust detested the german occupation of his country and he had many jewish friends in hungary

5338826 when youre in politics youve got to walk the walk and talk the talk
5338827 theres nothing wrong with pointing out the truth to the community
5338828 i dont like it and i admit that it is a problem for me
5338829 i call things as i see them some people see that as arrogance i admit that and it is a problem for us its something that i have to work on
5338830 it is the first time marathon swimming will be in the olympics so we are all on the same path

5338833 it will be a tough race because everyone worked so hard and i am just looking forward to it
5338834 no one would argue that point du toit was an emerging star in the pool when she swam at the 1998 commonwealth games as a 14 year old
5338835 i remember waking up later and asking my mother when the operation was going to be
5338836 throughout her recovery du toit was driven by a desire to get back in the water six months later she was swimming again
5338837 but du toit failed to qualify in the pool for the 2004 athens olympics struggling to keep up in a sport where the legs provide much of the power on starts and turns then her career took a promising turn

5338915 todo gran proyecto necesita transformarse para trascender y hoy nosotros estamos iniciando ese proceso
5338916 hemos realizado juntos un sue o que jam s imaginamos poder lograr cantamos lloramos y re mos con nuestras canciones a lo largo del mundo y ante millones de personas hemos dejado una huella imborrable en las vidas de millones de personas nuestros queridos fans
5338917 esperamos poder reunirnos pronto en cada uno de los shows y sentir esa magia que nos ha acompa ado estos cuatro a os
5338918 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5338919 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5338920 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5338921 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5338922 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5338923 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5338924 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5338925 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5338926 there really is no time for any frivolity people are already working two jobs to put gas in the tank so they can drive from the first job to the second job people need to spend as much of their free time as possible for candidates
5338927 i would rather you go and work for a local candidate then read my book
5338928 on the issues and on the importance of the election
5338929 but i dont agree about reading his book if people are going to vote wisely they need to understand whats at stake
5338930 i expect youll see a lot of editorial excitement from us on that book
5338931 in this world of celebrity blogs and entertainment gossip television we are intensely aware of public figures who perform the same function as mythological figures did in an earlier period
5338932 when i first started to read it i thought oh it was going to be a hatchet job but i enjoyed it anyway i was amazed with what she could do with so few pages at the beginning
5338933 we just felt the media coverage would benefit from a clearer field postelection and that is looking increasingly true
5338934 i did not ask wealth for my own it was just to make my rival groan
5338935 giants the parallel lives of abraham lincoln and frederick douglass
5338936 his functions as commander in chief have been undertreated compared to many other aspects of his life and career
5338937 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5338938 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5338939 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5338940 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5338941 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5338942 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5338943 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5338944 comets like sq372 have the potential to tell us what the entire oort cloud looks like which will test theoretical models of the clouds formation as well as provide clues about the environment that the solar system first formed in
5338945 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5338946 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5338947 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5338948 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5338949 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5338950 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5338951 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5338952 who are open to doing something on the production side
5338953 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5338954 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5338955 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5338956 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5338957 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5338958 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5338959 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5338960 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5338961 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5338962 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5338963 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5338964 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5338965 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5338966 ik ben bezig aan mijn laatste seizoen dat staat vast
5338967 het was vandaag een moeilijke wedstrijd er werd erg snel gelopen ik heb mijn beste seizoenstijd neergezet 1 57 68 meer kon ik niet doen ik ben tevreden over mijn wedstrijd en mijn carri re is mooi geweest al hoopte ik stiekem om hier iets hoger te eindigen

5338969 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5338970 this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5338971 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square senator obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq
5338972 prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5338973 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5338974 this was back when supporting americas efforts in iraq entailed serious political risk it was a clarifying moment it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5338975 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama
5338976 lies the ambition to be president whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5338977 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5338978 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5338979 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

5338982 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5338983 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5338984 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5338985 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5338986 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5338990 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5338991 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5338992 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5338993 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5338994 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5338995 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5338996 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5338997 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5338998 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5338999 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5339000 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5339001 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5339002 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5339003 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5339004 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5339005 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5339006 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5339007 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5339008 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5339009 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

5339111 in the twenty years weve been developing software solutions weve invested well over 100 man years in formulating the kinds of questions that truly tap into memories and open the mind to clearer thinking
5339112 we believe weve made significant progress in the areas of creativity and brainstorming and radically improved the ability for writers to apply computer aided creativity to their workflow
5339113 we now have an opportunity at very low cost of helping anyone build a creative edge
5339114 we hope to enable even more diverse groups later this year when we release thoughtoffice v2 0 the next thoughtoffice upgrade there are obvious benefits to increased creativity and innovation this software is all about helping people find that spark so they can realize their greatest creative potential we firmly believe these tools can channel and clarify that creative energy

5339116 it was apparent in the very early stages of working with intrallect that we shared the same vision for the way that learning materials can be quickly and easily produced used and reused by our customers both companies have an independent approach to developing products which is very much based on open standards and interoperability with other e learning tools this ethos has provided us a simple route to integrating the product sets into a single solution
5339117 each of the individual products that intrallect and myknowledgemap provide are very much best in class in their own right however we are increasingly finding that by bringing complementary products together we are able to provide even more value for customers
5339118 for example being able to organise resources in compendle and publish to intralibrary in a single click takes the normal time and effort out of managing resources and allows you to focus more on developing the resources themselves

5339124 through the rear view mirror sometimes it seems like a foregone conclusion but when its beginning theres all the
5339125 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5339126 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5339127 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5339128 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5339129 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services
5339130 last friday i spoke with workday a saas erp company ive been tracking since its start
5339131 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5339132 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5339133 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5339134 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5339135 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5339136 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5339137 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5339138 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5339139 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice

5339200 three years ago he did the exact same thing he grew out of his relationship to his wife and transferred his affection to another thats the biggest frustration with us the bottom line is that he was traveling too much and not taking care of his wife and family like he should
5339201 one of the things we dont understand is how god uses people of flawed character people ask me why choose someone whos dysfunctional because god does it
5339202 this is a personal failing on todds part and he can recover from it its not an excuse to live a sloppy life but there should be some encouragement here god knew ahead of time todds frailty but chose to use him anyway
5339203 unfortunately some christians are going to be disappointed with god its a good lesson for christians to say maybe you had unrealistic expectations

5339228 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5339229 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5339230 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5339231 tells the story of how the lowly rock dove became the pigeon a bird ubiquitous and annoying enough to be reviled as a rat with wings but one that has also inspired rapturous artistry and fetishistic devotion from breeders eaters and racers while managing to thrive just about anywhere humans have trod

5339239 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5339240 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5339241 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5339242 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5339243 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5339244 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers

5339248 service providers are operating in a capped capex environment now meaning generally they purchase equipment only when they need it
5339249 there are some areas in which most carriers are increasing their capex though growth areas tied to additional revenue such as voip

5339256 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5339257 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5339258 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5339259 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5339260 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5339261 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5339262 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5339263 what the children who have been victims of violence and abuse will make of all of this in the future we cannot know
5339264 but they will surely wonder why a feminist of such fame as greer has come to the defence of those who destroyed their innocence and damaged their sense of self
5339265 we are not in the mood for failed leftist excuses for the rising levels of homicide femicide and suicide
5339266 dr greers panoply of protest slogans deployed as social theory was dismissed long ago by the research and policy community as incapable of explaining the present day levels of huge disparities in life expectancy morbidity and mortality rates and other socio economic indicators
5339267 while the burden of history is acknowledged in much of this work the everyday suffering in communities at risk is caused by a multiplicity of factors all more complicated than dr greer would have us understand
5339268 i think its quite presumptuous to say that you know what is happening in the minds of aboriginal men
5339269 all im saying is that unless we deal with the pathology that underlies it we wont get anywhere
5339270 we wont actually stop the violence we may even cause it to escalate
5339271 one of the most powerful pamphlets ever written in australia
5339272 the issue with all of these processes is that you will get a wide range of correspondence covering a wide range of options
5339273 but until you go through some process you cant really determine whether theres substance to the correspondence
5339274 at the end of the day the process may well determine that thats not the appropriate way to maximise value for security holders
5339275 there is an opportunity for an astute investor looking to get into this space
5339276 assessing the optimal long term capital structure for bbp including an appropriate reduction in bbps gearing
5339277 there are question marks over what the western australian business is delivering right now
5339278 we shouldnt confuse short term sentiment with what really drives our decisions which is the long term supply and demand outlook
5339279 only time will tell to what extent the chinese economy is decoupled from the rest of the world but we can clearly see some differentiation in the economic performance of china the main driver of our volume growth and the developed world
5339280 people are way too optimistic and have been way too optimistic for years on the speed of which new projects can deliver new volumes
5339281 although we agree in general we are much more cautious in the short term given that demand for commodities still depends 40 to 45 per cent on the us and european markets while the stronger us dollar should continue to hold the miners back
5339282 the world hasnt constructed any new large copper mines and it hasnt put any capital into new geographies in a big way in order to bring on those massive volumes of copper
5339283 i have to think that in the medium to long term copper is going to be an exciting product to be in
5339284 i was happy to hand it over because itll be in good hands and theyll look after the country
5339285 its also a great partnership in which private conservation and government are working together
5339286 the results have been spectacular far better than we ever expected
5339287 mammal numbers are increasing in every habitat type and seed eating birds like gouldian finches are less stressed
5339288 it still is a pastoral lease but most of the people i know agree youve got to look after the country to maintain the industry
5339289 i think you will agree that these are spectacular results for any industry
5339290 prices alone are not enough and im pleased with our strong operating performance which underpins this record result
5339291 todays declaration is a strong signal of our confidence in the outlook and our ability to consistently deliver future earnings and cash flow
5339292 emerging economies should remain relatively strong on the back of continued domestic infrastructure investment and regional trade
5339293 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign
5339294 i leave my future in the hands of the people
5339295 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me

5339298 bye bye to pakistan god protect pakistan long live pakistan

5339302 we had nothing about this at the city no police report nothing as the years went by i guess the incident disappeared
5339303 it didnt change the fact that he died in the line of duty
5339304 the circumstances of why he died maybe explains why the story was buried pushed aside it was a terrible accident
5339305 i knew it would be some work even before i started looking into the death
5339306 but i figured that if he did really exist and truly did give his life for his community he deserves to be recognized and not forgotten
5339307 the stone was so old that the writing was fading
5339308 i rubbed dirt on it so i could see the imprint i snapped a few pictures it was exciting
5339309 with the stories i put together the pieces of what happened that night
5339310 one of the gun squad who was called spied mcdermott cried halt and shot up in the air
5339311 his mind set on the suspicious trio mcdermott failed to stop whereupon one of his companions shot at him he dropped to the ground
5339312 it must have been a very bleak day for our community
5339313 ill tell you i was surprised when he called me
5339314 when i started this research he was constantly on my mind
5339315 it was more about closure but now i feel ive done my part for him to get him remembered its out of my hands

5339352 i expect the rupee to move both ways we will continue with our current policy of hedging for two quarters because there is no long term visibility i expect the rupee to be in the range of rs 42 43 for the next 5 6 months
5339353 the rupee will keep swinging as oil prices soften and inflation comes down the rupee will gain but on the other hand the trade deficit is widening and there are no fresh fund inflows the recent currency movements are primarily in response to oil prices
5339354 if oil comes off prices fall then the rupee could go to rs 41 50 i expect range bound volatility between rs 41 50 rs 43 50 in the next one to two quarters
5339355 when the rupee was appreciating they said it would to go to rs 37 and when it was depreciating the figure was rs 47
5339356 for instance i dont think they will let it go to rs 45 or let it appreciate to rs 39
5339357 as long the macro economic environment remains uncertain nobody can say for sure which way the currency will move we are not increasing or decreasing our hedges at this point a lot of companies cancelled their hedges 3 4 months back they could now increase their hedges but we are not one of them

5339360 the system is completely broken its amazing that the system ever worked at all
5339361 more than 8 000 appraisers roughly 10 percent of the industry have signed a petition asking the federal government to take action
5339362 said they often felt pushed by a real estate agent or mortgage broker to fraudulently inflate a propertys value
5339363 the real issue is on the refinance side where people are cashing out of their equity on the basis of higher and higher values
5339364 conservatively id say that 10 percent of the houses i appraise are worth less than the mortgage on them
5339365 if a house is appraised for 10 percent or 15 percent more than its actually worth and the sale closes it may be used by another appraiser as a comparable sale the very next day
5339366 the cumulative effect of appraisal fraud is you may have investors holding mortgage debt thats backed by real estate worth less than they think it is
5339367 what if there are more stupid people vote than intelligent people
5339368 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

5339370 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
5339371 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
5339372 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
5339373 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
5339374 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

5339446 im not going to encourage shaun to move or anything but players want to play and if they are playing well for their club they put themselves forward for international selection
5339447 shaun is a very good player he has that bit of quality that can win games for the national team as well as his club so we will see what happens
5339448 the last campaign was relatively successful and with success comes added pressure
5339449 there will be an expectancy from the tartan army for this campaign and thats something we will need to handle
5339450 but we have players in the squad who are very experienced and we have younger players who play with no fear so i think thats an aspect we will handle
5339451 we are all looking forward to the campaign we have a genuine belief that we can qualify and we are very excited about it
5339452 this sanction is not right because i dont think i have committed a crime that merits such an amount
5339453 we have allowed andy to go on loan to bristol city until the january transfer window

5339455 andy has had a torrid time since he arrived at rangers and it will be good for him to get games every week in another environment
5339456 nosotros como organizaci n colegiada y con una trayectoria de 45 a os en el pa s nos preguntamos que si el gobierno est ayudando a los empresarios como se justifica que ahora los empresarios le han dado dos buenas para ello y no se ve la responsabilidad social por parte de los mismos es decir no hay ofertas en los supermercados desapareci la carne todo lo que se regul no est y ahora el pan canilla que est regulado no se consigue

5339459 were trying to deal with these individuals one on one
5339460 the expansion of the outreach services weve had has been very effective
5339461 no one is suggesting this is something you can sweep under the carpet
5339462 in fact the only people ive ever heard that from frankly are people in the media
5339463 what we need to do is deal with the problem rather than worry about who knows and who doesnt know we cant hide the problem anymore
5339464 theres 5 000 or more mushrooms in new brunswick probably more you really need an experienced collector along to keep you out of trouble
5339465 weve had such high frequency rains for the last three weeks that nothing ever dries off and as a result with the high humidity thats absolutely perfect growing conditions for mushrooms
5339466 i hope we continue to play the way we have been its not over yet anything can happen
5339467 but i was throwing my curve ball too much to some hitters and they capitalized you can only get away with things for so long
5339468 it feels real good to start hitting balls hard now hopefully it continues

5339673 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
5339674 im so tired of reading rave reviews for edge who has rapidly become not just the most overrated
5339675 besides striker who was money again my ecw hat goes off to mark henry again this week
5339676 concerned that the decision to withdraw this funding will have wide implications
5339677 everyone involved with dont trigger was totally shocked by the decision to stop our funding especially as we had been held up as a great example of a grass roots project the government have asked the community to come forward and get involved in efforts to cut gun and knife crime and thats exactly what we are doing without the funding we are finished
5339678 there is a real turn off factor among young people when they know a message comes from the government
5339679 our message is so effective because people in the community know us and respect the work we do
5339680 i feel like im on top of the world right now
5339681 we were talking about it before but had to do it the usa hasnt had a great showing so far so we wanted to prove something
5339682 its an honour to be mentioned in the same breath as ed moses he is a legend
5339683 it has all been about keeping the faith and staying strong over the last four years
5339684 just to be a part of this great tradition is a blessing
5339685 i wanted to win it pretty bad but i made too many mistakes
5339686 i messed up the last hurdle but i recovered pretty good
5339687 we are the three best guys in the world and thats something im really happy about
5339688 given the high food prices around the world and the need for poor people to lower their cost of food it just does not make sense for the doha negotiations to founder upon this barrier
5339689 working with wto director general pascal lamy the united states india and china should come up with a compromise
5339690 brazil a developing country that is both a major agricultural exporter and home to many poor farmers can help indonesia and australia may be in a position to contribute to a solution too
5339691 a compromise could create a speedy due process for challenges without appeal
5339692 could require examination of factors in addition to increased trade flows
5339693 he bush is opposed to it yet it hasnt changed
5339694 the soldiers told us they had an order from putin leave or be killed
5339695 they said putin has given us an order that everyone must be either shot or forced to leave they told us we should ask the americans for help now because they would kill us if we stayed
5339696 we didnt have any guns so he shot georgi in front of me without saying a word
5339697 a neighbour helped me to bury him in our garden and then i just fled
5339698 if they are not staying here why did they blow up our tv centre and bring their transmitters to broadcast their own tv and radio it looks very suspicious
5339699 it is a matter of fact that they have expanded geographically since yesterday
5339700 we feel legally bound to the commitment to cease fire that we have made but it looks like they dont feel committed to this agreement after the ceasefire they exploded the bridge and went deeper into our territory they have cut the country in two
5339701 we have two options either we attack them to get into the city or obey the rules that they impose they say that the moment they see any georgian police cars in the city they will shoot
5339702 they organise lines and tell us to come at a particular time but then they have nothing to give us there are men walking away with aid boxes and we get nothing they are also coming to peoples homes and looking for humanitarian aid to take back so that they can start selling it on the streets

5339705 pest pressures most of the season have been pretty low
5339706 thrips pressure has been constant but aphids mildew and other pests have been light on lettuce and broccoli
5339707 weve had ash rain the last month or two and were having a hell of a time getting control on two spot and some of the other pests were dealing with in those fields
5339708 weve been washing off plants with water and surfactants to get the ash off then coming back in and reapplying pesticides where we can but were running out of ammunition because we have to abide by the label for maximum use it has been pretty challenging
5339709 improving communication of data an example of an escape from the traditional spreadsheet
5339710 do i believe that the price of oil has peaked and that well see better times ahead
5339711 chances are better than ever that government money will be used to prop up fannie mae and freddie mac according to economists in the latest wall street journal forecasting survey and a nearly one in three said the institutions should be nationalized
5339712 uncertainty continues to permeate the economists forecasts as they remain almost evenly split for the third month in a row on whether the u s is currently in a recession they expect the economy to slow to a crawl in the second half of this year registering just 0 6 growth at an annual rate in the fourth quarter at the same time the forecasts call for continued job losses and elevated inflation with oil prices above 100 a barrel well into next year though down from current levels
5339713 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5339714 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use

5339716 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use

5339722 today i received a letter from the michigan department of human services child support division informing me that as the payee in a child support case i would be charged a 25 yearly fee in accordance with the federal deficit reduction act of 2005
5339723 the fee will be taken out in september to cover the last fiscal year and again in october of to cover the next fiscal year
5339724 as a single parent with two school age children and sporadic support coming in i find this amazing that the government wants to bleed me and other support recipients to pay a national debt that they through there own incompetence continue to build up to record highs

5339728 as journalists were good at finding great sources of information and distinguishing whats important but we also want to harness the very significant capabilities of our community
5339729 ordinary social media are too broad to draw ads but we can sell display ads reaching a specific audience on electronics or cars or medical devices
5339730 this is another example of the influence that rich special interests and their well connected lobbyists have on the political process and one more reason its time to change the way government works

5339734 we have six adirondack chairs decorated by different artists in the silent auction
5339735 the piece don gorvett created for the 55th anniversary will also be auctioned off
5339736 a couple of people had seen the chairs decorated and thought it would be an extraordinary idea for a fundraiser
5339737 the first one i did was a real challenge for me
5339738 i wrapped the image into the slats so when walk around the chair you see it its a three dimensional piece
5339739 every year weve gotten a larger and more enthusiastic crowd
5339740 people can know jesus through gospel music whether it is sang by a believer musician or a musician of the secular world
5339741 both have their messages but christian music can bring peace of mind while secular music is for pleasure and money
5339742 several times i have been sexually harassed and tortured by street boys
5339743 sometimes we are forced to learn vulgar expressions as a result of our exposure to insecure environments
5339744 i do this even during school periods i return from school at about 2 40 pm and start selling at 3 pm i hardly have time to do my home work thus my teacher beats me every day in school
5339745 my mother asked me to come and sell and said that when somebody wants to buy i should go and beg for wrapping paper
5339746 there is a criminal element in sending an under aged child to engage in such trades the state has also failed to punish those who propagate child labour

5339751 perhaps the most critical issue facing public education in a generation
5339752 what we tried to do was raise awareness with staff and assessed how we would handle future cases of suicide
5339753 we also discussed how teachers and staff could recognize signs of depression and suicide hopefully we will never have to experience an ordeal like this again but if it happens i think we will do the right thing and try to move forward
5339754 a lot of times family members have a hard time coming to terms and often slip into a state of denial
5339755 so we really have to make sure all our bases are covered and determine with certainty that suicide is in fact what happened
5339756 when officers arrive on the scene the first thing we do is clear and mark off the area then we try to search for a suicide letter or any other clue that would confirm suicide and start to slowly piece together the puzzle
5339757 it is not the time for more confrontation in pakistan

5339770 the medicine shoppe pharmacies in flint and lansing were independently owned and operated by the same franchisee unfortunately the franchisee chose to close his stores and did not take the proper steps to transfer his customers prescriptions to another pharmacy
5339771 at this time customers who had prescriptions at either pharmacy will have to contact their physician to get a new prescription sent to a new pharmacy
5339772 medicine shoppe international is working to ensure customer prescriptions are transferred to nearby pharmacies to minimize any inconvenience

5339799 muy pocas tienen claro lo que es el plan de negocio el mercado la tecnolog a las finanzas
5339800 quiz s la metodolog a de este gobierno no fue bien pensada el gran enemigo de las cooperativas ha sido la inexperiencia y la bonanza econ mica
5339801 el estado debe apoyar en el arranque pero las cooperativas deben nacer de una necesidad sentida de sus miembros en estas cooperativas resulta ser que es el propio estado el que le da los recursos y le lleva la contabilidad ese paternalismo no ha sido bueno porque la gente no aprende
5339802 estamos trabajando en el plan de formaci n de las cooperativas tomando en consideraci n la igualdad la repartici n de excedentes la parte jur dico contable y la socio pol tica
5339803 cuando alguien invierte su dinero se genera un sentimiento de propiedad y compromiso
5339804 las cooperativas requieren mecanismos para ser empresarios y para coordinar entre socios la ausencia de herramientas ha causado el fracaso de muchas de estas organizaciones

5339838 i just had a really good week out here and was able to play very steady golf
5339839 i played it safe when i could and was aware of where i was and it all worked out
5339840 loved this pen used it to mark all my golf balls first time i used identi pen my friend tried to tell me that the ball that was hit the longest was his but the ball had my marks on it thanks identi pen
5339841 identi pen is the best ball marking pen i have used ive scrubbed it in the ball washer fished it out of a water hazard beat it around for a couple of rounds and the mark survives also it doesnt color the face of the club
5339842 great pen for many uses i used identi pen to mark my golf balls and to identify some of my equipment additionally i used it for my childs school items the pen provided a clean permanent and quick drying mark each and every time
5339843 i found identi pen to be a very practical item to test and keep in my bag the two tip widths allow me to be creative with my personal logo i have used it to mark my golf balls and so far the color has remained vivid which is no small feat here in the northwest
5339844 the united cerebral palsy of los angeles was delighted to receive identi pens from sakura of america identi pen was provided to golfers to use while participating in this successful fund raising golf tournament

5339851 sabemos que estamos compitiendo con una diplomacia petrolera que est haciendo un lobby muy fuerte ante los gobiernos del sur para evitar que esto se discuta en el parlamento del sur pero seguimos insistiendo tenemos la constituci n la convenci n de derechos humanos la verdad la justicia de nuestro lado y el pueblo venezolano que hace votos porque se cumplan las leyes
5339852 creo que cualquier persona que se presente a las puertas de la comisi n con una violaci n de derechos humanos debe ser recibida y debe ser escuchado de no ser as se estar a violentando el principio m s b sico que es escuchar las partes de no ser escuchados se estar a creando un terrible precedente

5339869 you take a stick of juicy fruit gum it has to be juicy fruit and cut each stick in half length wise then you roll it up in a ball take a stick or screw driver poke a hole in the mole trail put a roll of gum into that hole carefully move the turf back to cover the hole
5339870 i put a ball of it in the entrance of the hole also do this every five or six feet in the moles trail do not pack down the trail
5339871 the gum swells up the moles digestive track and kills it
5339872 moles are insectivores they do not have the dental structure to gnaw poison grain baits even if they had a taste for them they probably will not or cannot eat chewing gum another fairly common home remedy either the popular brand of gum seems to be juicy fruit with any brand of bubble gum running a close second the only controversy that the gum enthusiasts share is weather or not to chew the gum first or leave it unchewed since moles cant eat either why worry

5339891 but were not going to have the manpower to hold the iraqi hands all the way through
