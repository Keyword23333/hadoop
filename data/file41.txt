410000 if production on the 360 version of ffxiii hasnt started
410001 that was the ps3 trailer shown at last years tokyo game show
410002 we have concerns about the 360 version of rage because of the economics of the platform in terms of what it costs to go to multiple discs
410003 there is disc space issue on the 360 and if we cant find a clever way or compromise with microsoft to address that issue
410004 i know that john is pretty much brass tacks on these issues and before the ps3 was ever released he raised the same issues then as now
410005 had a bunch of hardware engineers talking about theoretical power but carmack said yeah this isn
410006 complaining about that is sort of a worthless exercise at this point

410031 across many industries weve seen that the retailers that grow customer service ratings the fastest have greater sales growth
410032 prices have come down dramatically on electronics items and at the same time the complexity of the products has increased expert advice is more important than ever
410033 best buys strategy is not to cut back on people
410034 decided to cut out its high paid commissioned salespeople in favor of a younger and less experienced sales force
410035 while this move cut costs in the short term the new staff simply wasnt as effective at selling complex electronics and didnt provide the same levels of customer service the net result was a downward spiral in sales
410036 since tvs moved to solid state technology in the 60s theyve essentially been plug and play and completely maintenance free
410037 todays hdtvs by contrast include so many inputs and outputs that unless youre very sophisticated with electronics its better to let a professional set your tv up
410038 there are a lot of confused customers and they need extra help
410039 i can handle most installations and i dont have a need for the in store clerks
410040 if i find something that i cannot handle the manufacturers web site troubleshooting searches or online forums usually do the trick

410042 admittedly we have to go further in improving customer service in our stores but i am encouraged by the significant progress we have made
410043 a lot of this stuff is commoditized so what is the difference its our people its got to be
410044 everyone is going to be lowering price to the lowest possible point so service becomes the most important differentiator between retailers its the reason why a consumer would choose to shop at one over another

410050 in the china price i tell the story of a hong kong man who has a factory in southern china when he decides to supply to wal mart he learns that in order to do that he will have to follow chinas labour law which is quite restrictive by international standards
410051 the shadow factory allowed him to offer wal mart low prices by making his employees work round the clock not paying full overtime wages and skipping insurance payments and the five star factory the only factory employees ever see made it appear as though he was fully compliant with the retailers code of conduct
410052 one auditor who has been monitoring factories in china for over a decade estimates 99 of factories have a
410053 the shadow and five star factories are an unbeatable combination
410054 the hukou or household registration system dates back to the 1950s every chinese has a hukou people born in the countryside have rural hukou and those born in the cities to legal city residents have urban hukou social welfare benefits are tied to your hukou so if you are registered in a rural area your state subsidised healthcare is available there
410055 when millions of people started moving without government approval from the chinese countryside into the cities in the 1980s to work in export factories they moved without a legal guarantee of any social benefits today many migrant workers who account for 68 of manufacturing employees in china opt out of insurance coverage because they would have to sign up for a pension scheme that is not portable across provincial boundaries chinas prices have been low in large part because factories have not had to pay these costs
410056 coal more than any other product lies at the heart of the china price more than two thirds of chinas energy supply comes from coal a higher ratio than either japan or united states
410057 i visited a miners son who regularly hooks himself up to an intravenous drip and almost everyone i met in chinas coal country suffered from rhinitis often known as hay fever with more than 400 000 people dying every year from pollution related causes in china according to the official count i am sure rhinitis is only the tip of the iceberg in the health effects from coal
410058 i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time but to give us a usable answer to our offers stop dallying

410148 he was easygoing about talking to people now he was not social and was paranoid he thought there were people following him hed ask what is that black box on the road or why did you ask me that the military expects them to turn that switch were waiting at home doing it all ourselves and they come home and add more stress its like who is this guy the kids dont know who he is holy mackerel they come back so different

410160 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
410161 thus the heavens and the earth and all their army came to their completion
410162 and by seventh day rested from all his work that he had made and god proceeded to bless the seventh day and make it sacred because on it he has been resting from all his work that god has created for the purpose of making
410163 then the man said this is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh this one will be called woman because from man this one was taken that is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh
410164 and yehovah god proceeded to take the man and settle him in the garden of den to cultivate it and to take care of it
410165 thus yehovah god made to grow out of the ground every tree desirable to ones sight and good for food and also the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and bad
410166 but as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it for in the day you eat from it you will positively die
410167 now the serpent proved to be the most cautious of all the wild beasts of the field that yehovah god had made so it began to say to the woman is it really so that god said you must not eat from every tree of the garden at this the woman said to the serpent of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat but as for eating of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden god has said you must not eat from it no you must not touch it that you do not die at this the serpent said to the woman you positively will not die for god knows that in the very day of your eating from it your eyes are bound to be opened and you are bound to be like god knowing good and bad consequently the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was something to be longed for to the eyes yes the tree was desirable to look upon so she began taking of its fruit and eating it afterward she gave some also to her husband when with her and he began eating it
410168 and so he drove the man out and posted at the east of the garden of den the cherubs and the flaming blade of a sword that was turning itself continually to guard the way to the tree of life
410169 to the woman he said i shall greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy in birth pangs you will bring forth children and your craving will be for your husband and he will dominate you and to adam he said because you listened to your wifes voice and took to eating from the tree concerning which i gave you this command you must not eat from it cursed is the ground on your account in pain you will eat its produce all the days of your life and thorns and thistles it will grow for you and you must eat the vegetation of the field in the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground for out of it you were taken for dust you are and to dust you will return
410170 but as for abel he too brought some firstlings of this flock even their fatty pieces now while yehovah was looking with favor upon abel and his offering
410171 and as for me here i am bringing the deluge of waters upon the earth to bring to ruin all flesh in wich the force of life is active from under the heavens everything that is in the earth will expire
410172 make for yourself an ark out of wood of a resinous tree you will make compartments in the ark and you must cover it inside and outside with tar
410173 and as for you men be fruitful and become many make the earth swarm with you and become many in it
410174 and as for me here i am establishing my covenant with you men and with your offspring after you and every living soul that is with you among fowls among beasts and among all living creatures of the earth with you from all those going out of the ark to every living creature of the earth yes i do establish my covenant with you no more will all flesh be cut off by waters of a deluge and no more will there occur a deluge to bring the earth to ruin and god added this is the sign of the covenant that i am giving between me and you and every living soul that is with you for the generations to time indefinite my rainbow i do give in the cloud and it must serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth
410175 and yehovah proceeded to go down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men had built after that yehovah said look they are one people and there is one language for them all and this is what they start to do why now there is nothing that they may have in mind to do that will be unattainable for them come now let us go down and there confuse their language that they may not listen to one anothers language accordingly yehovah scattered them from there over all the surface of the earth and they gradually left off building the city
410176 he now brought him outside and said look up please to the heavens and count the stars if you are possibly able to count them
410177 as for me look my covenant is with you and you will certainly become a father of a crowd of nations and your name will not be called abram anymore and your name must become abraham because a father of a crowd of nations i will make you and i will make you very very fruitful and will make you become nations and kings will come out of you
410178 and he went on to say do not put your hand against the boy and do not do anything at all to him for now i do know that you are god fearing in that you have not withheld your son your only one from me
410179 and abraham began to call the name of that place yehovah yireh this is why it is customarily said today in the mountain of yehovah it will be provided and yehovahs angel proceeded to call to abraham the second time out of the heavens and to say by myself i do swear is the utterance of yehovah that by reason of the fact that you have done this thing and you have not withheld your son your only one i shall surely bless you and i shall surely multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens and like the grains of the sand that are on the seashore and your seed will take possession of the gate of his enemies and by means of your seed all nations of the earth will certainly bless themselves due to the fact that you have listened to my voice
410180 reside as an alien in this land and i shall continue with you and bless you because to you and to your seed i shall give all these lands and i will carry out the sworn statement that i swore to abraham your father
410181 at that god heard the voice of the boy and gods angel called to hagar out of the heavens and said to her what is the matter with you hagar do not be afraid because god has listened to the voice of the boy there where he is get up lift up the boy and take hold of him with your hand because i shall constitute him a great nation
410182 and i will give to you and to your seed after you the land of your alien residences even the entire land of canaan for a possession to time indefinite and i will prove myself god to them
410183 later on jacob called his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you what will happen to you in the final part of the days assemble yourselves and listen you sons of jacob yes listen to israel your father reuben you are my firstborn my vigor and the beginning of my generative power the excellence of dignity and the excellence of strength with reckless license like waters do not you excel because you have gone up to your fathers bed at that time you profaned my lounge he went up to it simeon and levi are brothers instruments of violence are their slaughter weapons into their intimate group do not come o my soul with their congregation do not become united o my disposition because in their anger they killed men and in their arbitrariness they hamstrung bulls cursed be their anger because it is cruel and their fury because it acts harshly let me parcel them out in jacob and let me scatter them in israel as for you judah your brothers will laud you your hand will be on the back of the neck of your enemies the sons of your father will prostrate themselves to you a lion cub judah is from the prey my son you will certainly go up he bowed down he stretched himself out like a lion and like a lion who dares rouse him the scepter will not turn aside from judah neither the commanders staff from between his feet until shiloh comes and to him the obedience of the peoples will belong tying his full grown ass to a vine and the descendant of his own she ass to a choice vine he will certainly wash his clothing in wine and his garment in the blood of grapes dark red are his eyes from wine and the whiteness of his teeth is from milk zebulun will reside by the seashore and he will be by the shore where the ships lie anchored and his remote side will be toward sidon issachar is a strong boned ass lying down between the two saddlebags and he will see that the resting place is good and that the land is pleasant and he will bend down his shoulder to bear burdens and he will become subject to slavish forced labor dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of israel let dan prove to be a serpent by the roadside a horned snake at the wayside that bites the heels of the horse so that its rider falls backward i shall indeed wait for salvation from you o yehovah as for gad a marauder band will raid him but he will raid the extreme rear out of asher his bread will be fat and he will give the dainties of a king naphtali is a slender hind he is giving words of elegance offshoot of a fruit bearing tree joseph is the offshoot of a fruit bearing tree by the fountain that propels its branches up over a wall but the archers kept harassing him and shot at him and kept harboring animosity against him and yet his bow was dwelling in a permanent place and the strenght of his hands was supple from the hands of the powerful one of jacob from here is the shepherd the stone of israel he is from the god of your father and he will help you and he is with the almighty and he will bless you with the blessings of the heavens above with the blessings of the watery deep lying down below with the blessings of the breasts and womb the blessings of your father will indeed be superior to the blessings of the eternal mountains to the ornament of the indefinitely lasting hills they will continue upon the head of joseph even upon the crown of the head of the one singled out from his brothers benjamin will keep on tearing like a wolf in the morning he will eat the animal seized and at evening he will divide spoil all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is what their father spoke to them when he was blessing them he blessed them each one according to his own blessing
410184 as for joseph he was brought down to egypt and potiphar a court official of pharaoh the chief of the bodyguard an egyptian got to buy him from the hand of the ishmaelites who had bought him down there but yehovah proved to be with joseph so that he turned out a successful man and came to be over the house of his master the egyptian and his master got to see that yehovah was with him and that everything he was doing yehovah was making turn out successful in his hand and joseph kept findind favor in his eyes and waited upon him continually so that he appointed him over his house and all that was his he gave into his hand
410185 so josephs master took him and gave him over the prison house the place where the prisioners of the king were kept under arrest and he continued there in the prison house
410186 well the thing proved to be good in the eyes of pharaoh and all his servants

410212 we are very pleased to receive this award from the fda their support provides welcomed additional resources to help develop rgn 137 for patients with eb currently there are no drugs approved to accelerate wound healing in eb patients and it is our goal to address this need we appreciate the fdas diligence in working with us as we continue clinical development and look forward to completing this phase ii clinical trial in 2009
410213 given what we know about the dangers of smoking it is astonishing that tobacco products are one of the least regulated products in our society
410214 the fda currently serves a vital role in protecting the health of americans through the regulation of food and drugs this bill ensures that the fda will have the resources necessary to regulate the tobacco industry in addition to its current responsibilities we should not let another day go by without taking the important step of passing this legislation to enact long overdue controls over these deadly products

410223 since 2000 and the institute of medicine reports on quality in health care there has been a shift from a health care provider centered model to one that responds more to the needs of the consumer
410224 this has coincided with studies suggesting patient centered medicine has a positive impact on quality of health care
410225 embo congratulates these two scientists as recipients of the 2007 embo installation grants and welcomes them to the embo community
410226 these talented scientists will benefit from the secure financial backing of their host countries plus the active interest and support of embo in their scientific and professional development they represent a promising scientific future for the countries receiving them and for europe as a whole
410227 these factors traditionally associated with quality care were not associated with informed decision making or with our knowledge measures surgeon volume or treatment setting did not affect whether women had good knowledge of their treatment options after they had been through the process nor did it really mediate the racial and ethnic differences we found
410228 its important for women to be able to do what we call a high quality decision making process that would mean that the decision needs to be well informed based on an accurate knowledge of the risks and benefits of the options and it also needs to be based on their preferences if women do not make an informed decision theyre more likely to be dissatisfied down the road with the treatment they received
410229 be sure to ask questions of your surgeon and consider exploring other avenues for getting information

410272 its the end of the world as we know it and i feel fine
410273 selama ini saya ngotot dengan orientasi dan filosofi kurikulum karena ada pandangan yang mengatakan kurikulum itu hanya untuk mengajarkan disiplin ilmu seperti yang sekarang itu bukan jelek akan tetapi kalau sekarang kita menginginkan agar kurikulum itu dapat memberikan kemampuan bagi anak untuk hidup maka teori kurikulumnya harus berubah filosofi kurikulumnya pun harus berubah
410274 jadi bukan lagi disiplin ilmu yang dipelajari tetapi apa sih sesungguhnya masyarakat ini mengapa begini dan semuanya begitu dan sebagainya
410275 sebab perkembangan ke depan sudah menuntut standar dalam setiap keahlian tertentu dan bukan lagi sekadar kompetensi saja
410276 bagaimana membuat kurikulum untuk mencapai standar itu merupakan kelebihan institusi pendidikan dengan begitu tidak semua institusi pendidikan memiliki kurikulum yang sama bisa saja kurikulum yang satu berkonsentrasi pada hal hal tertentu dan kurikulum yang lain mengonsentrasikannya pada hal lain meskipun bidang keahlian yang dipelajari sama

410279 we collected the price for a cup of coffee in bars and caf s of international standard frequented by expatriates in moscow and those places are very expensive
410280 we were surprised by earnings in india the huge demand for human capital and people with experience in management financial services and the it information technology sector means that expats have been able to demand increasingly higher salaries
410281 as the world becomes increasingly globalized companies want their managers to get a diversity of experience across the world while employees want an opportunity to experience a lifestyle and culture different from their own

410287 more than 300 were in line when berkeley countys hedgesville high school opened at 6 a m saturday for the second and final day of the mission of mercy some had waited since midnight others had had teeth pulled or repaired the day before and had come back for more work more than 1 100 people were treated during the two days said terry dickinson executive director of the virginia dental association an army of 700 volunteers from berkeley and the surrounding counties transformed the high school into a mash like dental facility
410288 about 4 000 of the states 34 000 active dentists provide 97 percent of all services to denti cal patients according to the dental health foundation
410289 but in loveland colo for two days only dental care is free
410290 one of his first patients is 8 year old jericho rogers who was up at 2 a m to get there
410291 he says he hasnt seen a dentist in three or four years are you surprised by looking at his mouth
410292 theres a lot of children running around in the united states that have cavities just like this and mostly just for lack of good dental insurance coverage
410293 the survey also found that the vast majority of medicaid and uninsured dental patients are seen by a small minority of dental providers
410294 in sacramento yolo amador el dorado and placer counties about 65 percent of children living in poverty do not have adequate access to dental care according to the sacramento district dental foundation statewide studies have shown that poor access is the result of lack of insurance and a limited number of dentists providing care for uninsured or underinsured patients
410295 more and more children throughout the united states are getting cavities north dakota is no exception
410296 some dentists smith said dont want poor people in the same waiting room as paying patients because of the appearance that quality might be compromised
410297 siegal said some dentists are unwilling to treat medicaid patients because the state reimburses dentists for only about half the cost of treatment he said about 25 percent of ohio dentists file medicaid claims each year
410298 the tooth is so decayed that it has to be pulled but generally we dont pull teeth in the emergency department
410299 in fluoridated yakima county where poverty is often accompanied by poor nutrition and dental hygiene theres an ample supply of children and low income adults in need of a dentist

410329 ive heard of people who have to make really hard choices when it come to paying for gas paying for rent and paying for groceries
410330 i dont make very much its just not enough theres not enough hours
410331 if its some jerk i went out on a couple of dates with i can do without that drama
410332 text messaging someone i would prefer not to see you again is really not my style
410333 but at the same time i wanted to avoid an awkward conversation
410334 were in this mode where were telling everybody everything all the time
410335 it becomes about saying things just blathering on were at the apex of that trend
410336 you pretend to be communicating when youre actually stifling communication
410337 a phone conversation is like wildfire you dont know where its going to go
410338 were slaves to our devices blackberries and phones reachable 24 7
410339 i dont want to get into hey whats going on how you doing
410340 i just get to the point like ill meet you at 3
410341 i just say i wont be coming in im under the weather by the time he hears voice mail its already noon
410342 it makes me feel better to know that this person who harmed so many people can never hurt anyone again
410343 and by taking his own life he has punished himself
410344 i always wondered if the perpetrator had any remorse or guilt over the deaths
410345 now unless they have something to convince the public that ivins was the guy i think well always remain open to the idea that it could have been someone else i think there will still be uncertainty
410346 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
410347 i was surprised that there has been an investigation going on
410348 it is sad that the man took his life so he couldnt give his side of the story life goes on and i hope this will be the end of it
410349 we still consider this to be the site of an active investigation
410350 it was a moving experience for all of us involved here
410351 it defied logic as to how a 94 year old living a quiet life in a small rural town could possibly be a victim of a terrorist act she was an unintentional and chance victim because her mail happened to cross paths with someone who was an intended target
410352 helps bring closure to the residents of oxford especially those who knew her lundgren
410353 i hope it will allow her to rest in peace
410354 now the person who did this has to answer to a higher authority which allows us in oxford to go on and not have it hanging over our heads
410355 she was a first class lady from everything ive heard about her
410356 i didnt even think they were even looking into it anymore
410357 i hope the investigators will continue to look into it and will be successful in learning who was responsible even if it turns out that it was this person who just died
410358 she loved life and especially enjoyed children and being around young people
410359 was i disappointed by his attitude not at all i found him to be very serious and focused
410360 he wanted to leave chelsea i am certain of that although it created a lot of anxiety for him and in fact he remained because of family matters
410361 he stayed for his father who he is extremely close to and for his whole environment therefore he was unable to create that split that they expected and we were hoping for
410362 inter coach jose mourinho did hope for this move but we knew it was going to be difficult
410363 so instead we thought of a player who in terms of age and wages is a good deal i am happy that sulley ali muntari has arrived
410364 it grew from nothing well that little hippo and we got braver and braver but also terrified wed never sell the work but we did
410365 its not just food which is in short supply most people no longer have access to essentials we take for granted everywhere you look there is desperation the driver we use had not eaten bread for three months we feed many of those we work with if you have foreign currency you have access to staples like eggs milk and loaves

410369 we asked her if shed consider a zimbabwean exhibition and she was so supportive do what you want to do was her response
410370 theres certainly no anxiety about beijings venue construction or infrastructure improvement
410371 we tested the operational capacity of beijing games organizers during a series of test events last year the good luck beijing and got good results
410372 there was the anxiety this week that websites that were reasonable to be opened for the games reporting were closed

410374 wherever you go in the world youll always get censorship in some form whats important is that censorship didnt impede on the justifiable ground for internet access for reporting the games im saying this because now were moving in that direction
410375 if the cabinets support rates remain low there is a possibility that moves to oust fukuda will become public due to anxiety about fighting an election with him as the campaign poster boy
410376 that is why some think that the appointment of aso is a strategic step toward replacing fukuda ahead of the election
410377 i will support the fukuda cabinet and put in my best effort
410378 for aso cooperating with fukuda is a risk if they lose the election he will go down with fukuda
410379 but if fukuda steps down before the election there will be a chance for aso to take the reins
410380 it could also backfire and that cannot be helped that is a matter of chance

410393 in todays compensation culture it is unfortunately all too easy to imagine a customer suing their dog psychologist if their dog continues to eat their slippers or somebody taking their feng shui consultant to court if theyre not happy with their homes energies
410394 but growth today depends more and more on investment decisions funded and funneled through the global financial system borrowing in low cost yen to finance investments in europe while hedging against the yens rise on a u s futures exchange is no longer exotic thus unrestricted and efficient access to this global system rather than the ability of governments to manipulate parochial monetary policies has become essential for future economic development

410396 governments should replace national currencies with the dollar or the euro or in the case of asia collaborate to produce a new multinational currency over a comparably large and economically diversified area

410597 well see how it goes it is always hard when you come to a new country i went to italy and it took me a few months to settle down so i dont want too much expectation on the lad it will take him time to settle in but we believe we have a decent player
410598 was i disappointed by his attitude not at all i found him to be very serious and focused
410599 he wanted to leave chelsea i am certain of that although it created a lot of anxiety for him and in fact he remained because of family matters
410600 he stayed for his father who he is extremely close to and for his whole environment therefore he was unable to create that split that they expected and we were hoping for
410601 inter coach jose mourinho did hope for this move but we knew it was going to be difficult
410602 so instead we thought of a player who in terms of age and wages is a good deal i am happy that sulley ali muntari has arrived
410603 if id have asked he would have given him to me
410604 he would be great in italy because he is always interested in different types of football
410605 he loves knowing about football and thats why he wouldnt have much of a problem adapting
410606 we have not made any formal offer for the player
410607 even though my contract was up at the end of last season i have always felt a part of things since we got back at the beginning of july
410608 ive had talks with the gaffer right through so its not as if ive been left out on the sidelines
410609 mick is a man of his word and i always knew i was going to sign it was just making sure that things were right for myself
410610 they made a bid and we didnt accept it but phil gartside bolton chairman got in contact and asked whether we could do a straight swap
410611 the offer is with them now so that is where we are with it
410612 theres no dialogue between rangers and fulham at the moment but there is money left over to buy players on top of madjid bougherra kenny miller kyle lafferty and andrius velicka
410613 what youre looking for is good value in terms of transfer fee and wages

410627 the blunt truth is that while contractors are carrying out valuable roles their overall effect has been to undermine the iraq mission and the wider fight against terrorism
410628 worst of all we have outsourced the most important core function of our government to fight and win the nations wars the us government needs to go back to the drawing board on its use of private military contractors especially regarding important armed roles in iraq and future operations these should again be handled by the government focused only on their contract the private firms standard practices include driving their convoys up the wrong side of the road ramming civilian vehicles tossing smoke bombs and opening fire with machine guns as warnings

410642 when the 1996 protocol enters into force it will supersede the london convention as between parties to the 1996 protocol which are also parties to the london convention
410643 if this is the case the london convention is likely to restrict the opportunities for the disposal of carbon dioxide under the seabed however such views are not definitive and it remains unclear whether carbon dioxide would be considered a waste for the purposes of the convention in addition as previously mentioned it is unclear whether the london convention covers sub seabed disposal of wastes this is not an issue under the 1996 protocol in contrast the 1996 protocol does not contain the prohibition on industrial waste nevertheless the reverse list of allowable materials which is essentially identical to the list contained in the london convention would likely mean that the same restrictions would apply when addressing the protocol

410658 it is once again evident that malaysian authorities do not care for minority rights and their ire is targeted against hindus who constitute an important bulwark to an authoritarian islamic state it is also a sad commentary that the nations of the world are ignoring what is a serious breach of human rights and minority rights
410659 they charged us for sedition when we spoke the truth
410660 sundays event was unprecedented and so we will not give up and continue with our struggle
410661 indian malaysians have very long been marginalised there has been inequality in job opportunities and education and in many other areas and sundays protest were significant because they were mostly youths and even women who turned up to demand change
410662 the underperformance of the indian working class may be attributed to the fact that indian workers were drawn from the less favored caste groups thus they continue to be weighed down by the low self esteem that usually characterizes members of groups belonging to the lower castes and is worsened by lack of the interaction between the well off and the less well off indians the marginalization of working class indians is reflected in their poor performance in business equity ownership and employment in professional sectors and the civil service the disadvantaged position of the majority in the indian community has contributed to a sense of dispossession and disadvantage among many indians in malaysia
410663 i feel that we are not aggressive enough as a community in terms of unleashing our entrepreneurial potential thats why our evolution has been very slow comparatively look at the tamils from sri lanka
410664 they have a more close knit community feeling they help uplift each other and they are certainly doing much better than the indians
410665 being non bumiputras sons of the land in malaysia we can never settle down here
410666 we know that getting a permanent residency is next to impossible so we are looking at opportunities in countries like singapore and australia where we can easily settle down and start a family
410667 the indian community problems are more than just equity most of their problems are social problems such as gangsterism i admit indians are among the poorest in this country but their participation and achievements in many other fields are amazing

410677 over the last 50 years indian have been marginalised in this country and we now want the same rights as enjoyed by other communities
410678 they have no rights to stop us from protesting today this is the will of the people
410679 this protest is illegal the police have been given permission to use legitimate means to halt the gathering and this means the use of tear gas and water cannons
410680 this demonstration should be a wake up call for the government that we are really upset with its policies
410681 malaysian indians have never gathered in such large numbers in this way
410682 they are frustrated and have no job opportunities in the government or the private sector they are not given business licenses or places in university
410683 there is still a lot to be done for the indians and we will continue with our struggle
410684 whatever the government is supposed to give us to look after our welfare well they have failed
410685 we are not a nation where the people cannot voice their grievances but it has to be done in the proper way we have elections they can contest they can campaign ask for votes
410686 malaysian indians have never gathered in such large numbers in this way
410687 they are frustrated and have no job opportunities in the government or the private sector they are not given business licences or places in university

410696 we were removed by duplicity and force from our villages in india and taken to the then malaya and put to work to clear the forests plant and harvest rubber and make billions of pounds for british owners
410697 after a century of slaving for the british the colonial government withdrew after granting independence and they left us unprotected and at the mercy of a majority malay muslim government that has violated our rights as minority indians
410698 very little opportunities for employment study and business are offered for minority indians as compared to the extensive aid created for native malays
410699 however the suit touches on many problems faced by minority indians in malaysia such as lack of opportunities destruction of hindu temples right to an education in their mother tongue and lack of avenues for advancement
410700 the malaysian government must address these issues minority indians are malaysians and they have a right to a fair share of the national resources
410701 the suitability of suing london aside the grievances raised are long standing and wholly valid and need urgent solutions from the malaysian government
410702 the british government cannot detach itself permanently or partially from the many problems it left behind
410703 it has a moral legal social and political responsibility to ensure there existed fair governance throughout her former colonies and any violation of rights must be attended to immediately before it becomes a menace causing an international crisis
410704 minority indians today are the underclass not only in malaysia but in other former british colonies
410705 they were neglected abandoned and left to fend for themselves
410706 the problems of poverty and marginalisation are severe among the indian underclass
410707 i dont want to discuss the merits of the suit but the problems of minority indians are real and valid and the malaysian government must attend to it
410708 they could have filed the suit in london out of sheer desperation at not getting an airing and discussion here
410709 it shows the situation of the indian poor is desperate and worsening
410710 indians predominate as labourers industrial manual workers office boys road sweepers beggars and squatters
410711 we want the world to sit up and see our plight and bring pressure on the malaysian government
410712 there seems to be an unofficial policy of hindu temple cleansing in malaysia the reason given was that the temples are illegally occupying land but demolishing places of worship is unlawful under our penal code
410713 the indians are very angry if the local authorities keep on demolishing temples it will incite racial hatred and we are worried that the community will turn violent
410714 these state atrocities are committed against the most underprivileged and powerless sector of the hindu society in malaysia we appeal that this hindu temple and all other hindu temples in malaysia are not indiscriminately and unlawfully demolished
410715 violation of hindu human rights in malaysia and class action
410716 these processes may become possible only after return of azeri refugees and displaced persons
410717 nagorno karabakh residents will decide for themselves whether the republic will return under azeri control or will be independent

410721 british citizens have the right to marry whoever they choose but we want newcomers to succeed in our society and sign up to the standards we have in common that means freedom not being forced to marry someone and it means newcomers quickly acquiring a command of english with consequences for those who break the rules

410733 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
410734 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
410735 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them

410796 ethnic cleansing is like what happened in bosnia when the serbians killed and did everything to wipe out bosnians from the country we are not doing any such thing here
410797 because we respect other religions and they are not our enemies
410798 surely what is being questioned has racial undertones aimed at disrupting the prevailing peace harmony and well being of our people
410799 does this not show that we malaysian indians are still being viewed as aliens by these malay rulers otherwise why does rustum demand our disenfranchisement just because we asked to be treated as equals the international community should take note of this
410800 these are issues which our national governments in member states can handle let malaysian authorities handle this they are capable
410801 the isa is a preventive measure that can protect the country from serious disturbances of the peace the isa is still there and when appropriate will definitely be used

410805 unhappiness with their status in society was a real issue
410806 the marginalisation of the indian community the neglect of their concerns and the alienation of their youth must be urgently addressed

411041 an american commitment to deterrence especially if seen by israelis as a substitute for prevention is itself likely to spur israel to consider independent action
411042 so much there was deceptive that it is necessary to suspend the whole enterprise and to bring instead the method of the critical philosophy into play this consists of examining the process of reason itself of dividing and testing the human knowledge capacity in order to determine how far out its boundaries may be placed
411043 fictitious forces fabricated at will which not finding any obstacle in the principle of contradiction are poured forth in multitudes by those of speculative mind
411044 there are never two things in nature which are exactly alike and in which it is impossible to find a difference that is internal or founded on an intrinsic denomination
411045 even their round form indeed even the space through which they fall are nothing in themselves but only mere modifications or foundations of our sensible intuition the transcendental object however remains unknown to us
411046 about these appearances further much may be said a priori that concerns their form but nothing whatsoever about the things in themselves that may ground them
411047 we can understand nothing except what brings with it something in intuition corresponding to our words when we complain that we do not see into the inner nature of things this can mean no more than that we cannot grasp through pure reason what the things that appear to us might be in themselves observation and division with respect to the appearances take us into the interior of nature and we cannot say how far this will proceed but every transcendental question that takes us beyond perceptible nature can never be answered
411048 without the things placed in it one point of space does not absolutely differ in any respect whatsoever from another point of space
411049 a certain order in the community of substances and time the dynamic sequence of their states
411050 space in general does not belong to the properties or relations of things in themselves
411051 the difference between similar and equal things which are not congruent cannot be made intelligible by any concept but only by the relation to the right and left hands which immediately refers to intuition
411052 abolished the distinction between phenomena and noumena to the great detriment of philosophy
411053 the action of an internal principle which brings about change or the passage from one perception to another
411054 receptivity of the subject by which it is possible for the subjects own representative state to be affected in a particular way by the presence of some object
411055 the faculty of the subject by which it has the power to represent things which cannot by their own quality come before the sense of that subject
411056 there is something great and i think very correct in leibnizs notion that the soul embraces the entire universe with its representational powers although only an infinitely small part of this representation is clear outer things can carry the condition of their presentation but not the force to bring themselves into existence for us
411057 if anyone were to pose the question to me what is the constitution of a thing that thinks then i do not know the least thing to answer a priori because the answer ought to be synthetic but for every synthetic solution intuition is necessary but this is entirely left out of so universal a problem
411058 why should one admit bodies if it is possible that everything happens in the soul as a result of its own powers which would run the same course even if entirely isolated
411059 nothing takes place without a sufficient reason in other words nothing occurs for which it would be impossible for someone who has enough knowledge of things to give a reason adequate to determine why the thing is as it is and not otherwise
411060 the organized mass in which the point of view of the soul is located being expressed more immediately by it is reciprocally ready to act on her account following the laws of the corporeal machine at the moment when the soul wills it without one disturbing the laws of other the animal spirits and blood taking on exactly the motions required to correspond to the passions and the perceptions of the soul
411061 the most power knowledge the greatest happiness and goodness in created things
411062 takes part in a perpetual and most free progress so that it is always advancing toward greater culture cultivation
411063 we should be content with providence and with the course of human affairs as a whole which does not begin with good and then proceed to evil but develops gradually from worse to better

411076 i wouldnt trust the possum brained redneck motherfucker than i could throw him
411077 walters allegedly told the defendants that if they didnt plead hed fuck em up
411078 whatever ultimately happens concerning the judge this does not mean these cases go away
411079 it will just take longer to get them to trial however i may seek to have the decision overturned
411080 i told these kneegrows i would fuck with them and now i will
411081 everyone is entitled to a fair judge not the judge they want
411082 it mystifies me why the district attorney would fight this
411083 we have not set any targets about finishing in the table
411084 but what we are looking for is as the league goes on to be competitive in every game
411085 we realise we might be a bit behind other teams to start with
411086 but if we can contest games thats what we are aiming for
411087 we just have to wait to see how our players adjust and what the opposition is like to see if we can predict where we might finish
411088 the club has been working hard to get sfl status for 30 years or so and we are up for the challenge
411089 we are looking forward to seeing how we fare against cowdenbeath who will be very tough opponents for us
411090 i did have some experience with arbroath and know what to expect in the third division
411091 the next contest is going to be massive both teams will have equal edge
411092 we have all been under pressure like jock hobbs and the board and the administration the team and i guess the new zealand rugby public just wanted a performance and they got a performance tonight which was right out of the top drawer
411093 that is great it gives us a foundation gives us some confidence gives us a wee bit of a relief from the pressure and you know what that is like
411094 they played exceptionally well to keep us alive it was a fine performance tonight
411095 tactically they played very well we changed the game plan and the guys executed it exceptionally well

411105 up until now its been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by als
411106 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life
411107 therapeutic use of the cells is probably a long way off
411108 we also dont know how to reintroduce cells into a sick adult in a way that will be beneficial all these hurdles need to be overcome first before we can think about using the cells to treat disease but we can start immediately to evaluate them as a tool for drug discovery

411117 this particular audience is people who ordinarily do not have a tax filing requirement and who would not normally file a tax return every year
411118 in order to receive the payment they must file a tax return with us
411119 thats an enormous number when you think about it especially now with times so tough
411120 this is a special focus for us were trying to reach out particularly to seniors
411121 all it takes is a few simple steps and the payment can be on its way
411122 its not too late to file but the sooner people file the faster theyll receive their money
411123 as they get older and their health is compromised many of them transfer the decision making powers to their adult children
411124 if the folks who havent gotten the payments get them they would do what everyone else has done
411125 spend part of it save part of it pay down debtwith it so obviously that doesnt mean that 21 million would flow into the economy right now but part of it would and that would stimulate sales tax growth
411126 well go where we think we can make the biggest impact first
411127 if theres still time well fan out to other areas
411128 we went to senior centers senior housing any location that would have a high concentration of older people well continue to mail outreach material until october
411129 we get a lot of people coming into our senior centers and office for fans energy bill assistance or medicaid assistance
411130 the first question we ask is have they signed up for their stimulus payment
411131 john clarice and wyatt wanted me to tell you that they got a call from the police station with some bad news all five of our prisoners have escaped and guess what they reported the same creatures as the ones which attacked us at micheals club
411132 eight of them but this time all of them just 7 footers the police gave clarice and wyatt copies of the footage for us to look at when we get back to the resort
411133 do you feel like going back to play some more games

411177 we are one community one people one planet we are here today to affirm that oneness we are here to bear witness to the passing of the 33 members of our family at virginia tech university who have met an untimely and terrible fate
411178 we are here for all of those who are gone for all 33 we are here for the 32 who have passed from the immediate to another place not by their own choice we are also here for the one who has also passed
411179 i am deeply disappointed by a media report that could lead to the revival of unfounded rumors about an ou students apparent suicide more than a year and a half ago our society is not well served by encouraging insensitivity or by raising unnecessary levels of fear in the broader community
411180 this was so long ago were certain he meant no harm to others youre being insensitive and youre causing fear and inciting hate in the community
411181 we need to encourage understanding and compassion in our society instead of more anger and intolerance based upon misinformation what kind of people would we be if we refused to allow a grieving family the right to remember their deceased son or brother of course if there had been any evidence that he was attempting to harm others our decision would have been different but there was none
411182 no evidence was ever found to indicate that the deceased ever attempted to enter our stadium or ever intended to do so nor was there a single shred of evidence to link him to terrorist groups there was never any evidence developed to sustain any theory other than suicide in the very thorough briefings provided to me by law enforcement regarding the situation i regret that the news story may have left the impression that the students death was anything other than a suicide
411183 fbi agents said they do not know if the student intentionally set off the bomb on the bench as a suicide or if he also had intended to kill others elsewhere a norman police bomb expert has said he believes the bomb went off accidentally and that the student had further plans
411184 the university did not erect a monument in honor of this student the pavers are placed there by those who purchase them for a charge of 150 per stone in this case the sons father and the proceeds go toward the upkeep of the student union we are very proud of the fact that members of our university family are sensitive and compassionate to family members impacted by this students death
411185 jesus get me off this cross and let me go about my business i have repented and i am no longer a danger to society surely you can see that besides it would be really impressive if you did one last miracle

411213 i dont know how you can be so stupid and so beautiful all at the same time
411214 you should do it because you get up first and then we dont have to wait as long to get our coffee
411215 you are in charge of cooking around here and you should do it because that is your job and i can just wait for my coffee
411216 no you should do it and besides it is in the bible that the man should do the coffee

411218 but then why didnt you stay out longer and catch more
411219 but what do you do with the rest of your time
411220 i sleep late fish a little play with my children and take a siesta with my wife in the evenings i go into the village to see my friends play guitar sing a few songs i have a full life
411221 i have an mba from iim a and i can help you you should start by fishing longer every day you can then sell the extra fish you catch with the extra revenue you can buy a bigger boat
411222 with the extra money the larger boat will bring you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers instead of selling your fish to a middle man you can then negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant you can then leave this little village and move to panjim or even mumbai from there you can direct your huge new enterprise
411223 afterwards well my friend thats when it gets really interesting
411224 when your business gets really big you can start selling stocks and make millions
411225 after that youll be able to retire live in a tiny village near the coast sleep late play with your children catch a few fish take a siesta with your wife and spend your evenings doing what you like with your buddies
411226 with all due respect sir but thats exactly what i am doing now so whats the point wasting 25 years

411229 girl i know you were not foolish enough to put all that money in there
411230 listen im a christian i cannot go back on my word i promised him that i was going to put that money into the casket with you mean to tell me you put that money in the casket with him
411231 i got it all together put it into my account and wrote him a check if he can cash it then he can spend it
411232 the roman catholic church has finally ended all hope that anglican priestly orders will ever be recognised as valid
411233 although our dialogue has led to a significant agreement on the idea of priesthood the ordination of women to the episcopate blocks substantially and finally a possible recognition of anglican orders by the catholic church
411234 we hope for the continuation of a theological dialogue between the anglican communion and the catholic church but the latter development directly undermines our goal and alters the level of what we pursue in dialogue
411235 i know many of you are worried some also deeply about the threat of fragmentation within the anglican communion
411236 i want to briefly draw your attention to the statement of arcic life in christ which notes that anglicans could agree with catholics on the fact that homosexual activity is disorderly but we could defer relatively to the moral and pastoral care that should be offered
411237 in light of the tensions of recent years in this regard a clear statement by the anglican communion would offer us more opportunities to offer a common witness of human sexuality and marriage a witness sorely needed in todays world
411238 it seems to us that the anglican communion is very close to the protestant churches of the sixteenth century and is taking a position that those churches took until the second half of the twentieth century

411267 the project manager sen french already elevated this by publicly suggesting impeachment before the senate laid out any rules or an investigator was named
411268 publicly elevating this to impeachment raises doubts as to how fair a process some senators may intend for this to be
411269 to investigate the circumstances and events surrounding the termination of former public safety commissioner monegan and potential abuses of power and or improper actions by members of the executive branch
411270 we want to make sure this process is fair and theres no conflict of interest
411271 i think everybody wants this to be done in a timely manner including the governor
411272 one of the reasons we are doing this isnt to point a finger its to blow a cloud away and the sooner you blow that cloud away the better it is for the department the governor and alaskans

411282 shawn nodded yes and the doctor went crazy like carlton on fresh prince of bel air
411283 he woke up fine hes awake hes talking so far everything is going well

411288 its like a rotating thing back and forth back and forth
411289 if we got youth to 18 that was an enormous accomplishment and that in and of itself was a good thing
411290 if youre a single person and youre working 40 hours a week at minimum wage youre probably not going to be able to afford a one bedroom apartment in anchorage without some kind of assistance
411291 when youth that are just out of custody are competing with people who have had a job for awhile and have a credit history theyre just going to get tagged
411292 theres not a lot of spare housing out there and the transition programs are very limited
411293 i think its the influx of the kids who come here because theres a limited economic base in their community
411294 and they come here and it all looks very attainable but its so far from an easy grasp
411295 i was rooming with somebody when i first moved here and that still wasnt covering living expenses
411296 i went home because i couldnt afford rent anymore and the hours of work wasnt doing too much
411297 ive heard of people who have to make really hard choices when it come to paying for gas paying for rent and paying for groceries
411298 i dont make very much its just not enough theres not enough hours
411299 the study doesnt show exactly what caused amd its not clear that diet was solely responsible for any cases of amd participants werent followed over time and they werent asked to change their diets for the study however the researchers estimate that a fifth of the advanced amd cases in their study might have been prevented by eating foods low on the glycemic index

411314 why how could you have sinned against all men more than all robbers and murderers have done that but what sin have you committed yet that you hold yourself more guilty than all
411315 little heart of mine my joy believe me every one is really responsible to all men for all men and for everything i dont know how to explain it to you but i feel it is so painfully even and how is it we went on then living getting angry and not knowing
411316 why reckon the days one day is enough for a man to know all happiness my dear ones why do we quarrel try to outshine each other and keep grudges against each other lets go straight into the garden walk and play there love appreciate and kiss each other and glorify life
411317 birds of heaven happy birds forgive me for i have sinned against you too
411318 there was such a glory of god all about me birds trees meadows sky only i lived in shame and dishonoured it all and did not notice the beauty and glory
411319 mother darling its for joy not for grief i am crying though i cant explain it to you i like to humble myself before them for i dont know how to love them enough if i have sinned against every one yet all forgive me too and thats heaven am i not in heaven now

411326 i want to look my fellow americans directly in the eye and declare to them i am not the anthrax killer
411327 i know nothing about the anthrax attacks i had absolutely nothing to do with this horrible crime
411328 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
411329 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions
411330 and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
411331 old photostat copies from the 20s and 30s are shiny like that so this is why youd think this is not a real document

411335 the people who lived through love canal need to know what their risks are and what they might expect for their children

411340 alice hummel disappeared never to be heard from again after agreeing to confront her husband bruce hummel about his molestation of their 13 year old daughter
411341 the evidence clearly shows that bruce hummel had the motive and opportunity to murder alice hummel and in fact did so in october 1990
411342 i rowed and bailed for an hour and a half at least but the wind got worse and i had to let her body go
411343 i was too tired to cry but i remember saying a silent prayer
411344 it was sort of an unspoken thing our family didnt talk about it at all
411345 but the circumstances of what we heard that she left without saying goodbye to her own children we knew she would never have done that a mother would never go off without saying goodbye to her own children
411346 it would be inherently cruel to move her to mexico
411347 weve grown up with jenny shes our family she deserves better than getting sent to a drive through tourist attraction in mexico
411348 jennys situation is of great concern to many people i represent
411349 this is not an indictment of the zoo in mexico but jenny deserves to be somewhere she will be happy
411350 we know she is a nervous elephant and with protected contact she can approach people if she wants to and we can monitor her stress levels easily without anyone getting hurt or killed

411507 why is it you have not had the courtesy for one time to speak on interests of the oppressed and exploited black community in this nation
411508 we need to be positive and approach the two legs in a good frame of mind because we know from experience how tricky qualifying games can be
411509 i know that they have not played in the group stages of the champions league before so they will be keen to change that
411510 also they will have the confidence of champions after winning their title so we will respect the opposition as we always do
411511 it is good that we play away first and also that we do not have to travel very far
411512 i think there are two very important things about this draw firstly the second game is at home which is really really important clearly that makes a massive difference to play the deciding game in front of our own fans
411513 im also pleased because the travelling isnt a problem we dont have to go too far which is good news especially when you look at some of the teams we could have drawn
411514 people may say its a kind draw for us but we will treat them with respect
411515 we know some things about their team already but we
411516 of course we know about oguchi onyewu because he spent some time with newcastle
411517 axel witsel is a good young player and wilfried dalmat is probably the best player in their team
411518 alexandre da silva is a good defender as well so we know they wont be easy opposition for us
411519 overall though it is a good draw and we are happy
411520 in the last two games we have created several chances but either the opposition keeper has played really well to stop us from scoring or we have just missed the target
411521 there is no problem i am sure the goals will come and the important thing is that the players are creating chances
411522 when they have more sharpness they will score more goals
411523 at this stage it is all about preparing for the start of the season and i know that when the season begins my players will be ready
411524 last season fernando torres steven gerrard ryan babel dirk kuyt yossi benayoun and peter crouch all got double figures for us so i know we have the players to score goals
411525 crouch has left but we have brought in robbie keane who also got double figures for tottenham so i am not concerned

411544 police are speaking to her to establish what happened suffolk homes
411545 the fresh claim has been submitted on the basis that the extensive publicity has found its way on to togolese websites which are likely to be monitored by and of interest to the togolese authorities
411546 regardless of his earlier evidence this alone may create an adverse interest from the togolese authorities should he be returned

411570 you ought to start bringing your own food this stuff will make your face swell up again im still convinced it was cafeteria food that did that to you in the first place
411571 i think if it was more people would have turned into bloated toads
411572 and parents would have complained parents always complain like they think that changes anything
411573 i bet the cafeteria does have some kind of disease they put in random students food to test what happens to them
411574 because theyre trying to create an army of mindless zombie warriors to take over the town and theyre testing out the formula
411575 yours was a bad test they probably got files somewhere saying but a failure that particular cafeteria lady was

411587 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened my relationship with my protection team was always cordial certainly entirely professional this kind of absurd behaviour never occurred
411588 i never heard myself called by the name scruffy in nine years
411589 i tried to tell him that having us around hadnt put scruffy off his stroke in the past
411590 i dont even want to dignify that with a response the police always had enormous respect for my privacy they understood it was very difficult for me to live in a house with four strangers it is an obscenity to suggest that i asked people to leave the room so that i could have sex with my girlfriend i will not have that said about me
411591 with her grandmother she and the girls took her to the doctor today she hasnt been recuperating from her cold and it seems that the vaccine yesterday bothered her a bit i thought it would be best for her to be watched over by the girls rather than try to multi task with research and her illness i wish i could be with her but the results of our experiments are near overdue
411592 of course not they know our research is important but in my own heart i know i should be with her no rest for the weary eh ienzo
411593 just curious with her being here every day its kinda weird not seeing her
411594 so shes already been to the doctor why is she going back
411595 i just want them to ask about the antibiotics that were issued what with her reaction to the shot im afraid of giving her any medicine until i have theyre assurance
411596 our deadline is thursday if we can write out our final draft today that gives us two more days to complete and send it in
411597 id appreciate that dilan but this is my task too braig quit poking the baby

411599 at the bottom where its folded there was a pressed chrysanthemum flower can i see
411600 the doctor said that the inflammation is minor but he did lower the dosage of her medication for safety reasons
411601 we had so much work to do we were able to finish the entire assignment but i feel like i should be with her
411602 besides all shes done is sleep and cry all day and its not like we dont already deal with that anyway
411603 busy you know his job is pretty similar to your brothers mostly peacekeeping and such so hes gone for a couple weeks at a time the good part about that is his trips are rare so he has a lot of time to be with kairi and me
411604 i i may try i dont know what he is but i think it he is definitely worth a try
411605 if not im sure i can find a good home for him
411606 are you sure what if people are kinda scared by him
411607 yknow its kinda cute in a weird spooky kinda way
411608 hes extremely docile in the couple of hours between finding him and dropping lucinda off with you he would just let me hold him he wouldnt move wouldnt fuss hed just look around at me at things around me i havent heard a single noise out of him literally
411609 we gave her a dose of her medicine just an hour ago so she should be set for the night
411610 thanks the good thing is that the boys and i dont have any pressing tests or experiments for about a month by that time im hoping lucinda will be better and ill have found a home for trigger
411611 i dont know yet like you said i dont know if i can take care of two children at the same time i mean i dont know what his needs are or anything like that but im not sure if anyone else would know ive never seen of heard of ive never come across anything like him so what are the odds that there is someone out there who does it may be possible but ive never seen any kind of book record or picture on anything remotely similar
411612 you dont want to place him on someone if they dont know either huh
411613 its not so much as that i dont know just yet what the answer is but i guess well find out soon
411614 id better go its getting late and i should probably let you and the kids rest up
411615 you know i dont think it matters how busy you are with work i bet theyre just proud of you for being there
411616 and here i havent even had the chance to decide on what to do with him they go and get attached

411638 they are on the right path to make fuel efficient cars but its going to take time
411639 i do see more of a resolve we need to take these actions and focus on what we can control

411651 the mccain camp doesnt meaning for the last couple of weeks all you have heard from them is about britney spears and paris hilton
411652 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
411653 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
411654 i will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
411655 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
411656 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
411657 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
411658 it seems like we are in a close race in florida you dont just say people voted one way if you dont show up you dont get the vote

411662 had santa rosa memorial hospital provided proper care advice jeremiah chass untimely death would have been prevented
411663 all officer involved protocols were followed and that no wrongdoing was found
411664 the situation exploded into violence when that deputy jumped on jeremiah suddenly pepper sprayed him in the face and attempted to choke him to unconsciousness
411665 at that point mr chass lost his hold on jeremiah and the frightened blinded boy already suffering delusions fought back
411666 it would have served no purpose to oppose this because the granting of these motions is routine which is evidenced by the fact it was granted within two hours of it being submitted
411667 obama is anything but na ve he knew the instant that he tossed his hat in the presidential ring that race would be an issue maybe even the dominating issue in the white house campaign so its hardly a revelation that republican rival john mccain would turn the tables and accuse obama of playing the race card this deft or crude bit of reverse political psychology says obama plants a seed in voters minds that he hides behind color to play on white guilt or do a hit job on mccain
411668 meanwhile obamas hands arent completely clean on the race issue team obama lambasted hillary clinton for supposedly denigrating dr martin luther king jr made a blatant racial pitch to blacks to flood the polls in the south carolina primary and uses a bible thumping preacher cadence in talking to black audiences

411679 these results are an impressive start we will work to continue to drive people with type 2 diabetes to their doctors and other resources that can help them improve how they manage their conditions

411681 similar to the medical home concept as part of this program physicians provided comprehensive coordinated care for their patients that enhanced their health
411682 the fact that more people in the united states are infected with hiv every year than previously thought shows that we need to be working much harder to control the epidemic in the united states
411683 the united states can be proud of having more than tripled its remarkable commitment to the global hiv aids epidemic
411684 these new figures from the cdc demonstrate that the domestic epidemic needs a similar response
411685 not many people have thought seriously about the interactions between a superfluid and a superconductor that are co existing like this
411686 we found that the boundary wasnt just shifted but new behavior appeared when the superconductor is on the edge between type i and type ii
411687 we were surprised that there was anything new to mine here
411688 when the fracture results in nanoplates it leads to a low level of fracture energy at a certain size resulting in a size specific fracture
411689 it also may prove useful in the deliberate creation of large quantities of stable nanostructures
411690 thus the phonon confinement should occur instantaneously as the crack propagates
411691 this could have important consequences not only for small materials but also for the way cracks propagate in nanostructured bulk materials

411699 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
411700 we applaud the breeders cup for deciding to attach strong penalties to anabolic steroids uses
411701 not really a big deal or an issue for us
411702 i really didnt even know what theyre doing out there but if youre not allowed to do winstrol out there ill find out when the time comes
411703 whatever the rules are in the state were going to play by the rules
411704 the breeders cup board believes its crucial that we take a leadership role in eliminating anabolic steroids from our sport
411705 we encourage each racetrack and racing jurisdiction to move swiftly in enacting these much needed regulations
411706 represent important steps in the implementation of national equine health and safety initiatives
411707 i think thats what made it so hard was that i didnt think id really get it there
411708 then when i did get it there and it hit the pole im like
411709 everybody says from over 40 yards he was this for that
411710 and yeah i missed some kicks from over 40 yards but i tried some kicks that a lot of teams wouldnt have even tried a 59 a 57 a 43 into the wind a 48 into a driving rain
411711 the one good thing about eagles coach andy reid is hes never been a numbers guy with me
411712 youre going to lose something over the years there is no question about that
411713 but the thing is other than one kick against the redskins i didnt have any kicks come up short
411714 when youre stroking it you feel all the confidence in the world when you start to miss a couple sure the questions come up but what you have to do is fight through that thats what makes the difference between guys who are good and not so good
411715 before every game and sometimes during the game if the weather changes we will discuss exactly what his range is
411716 it does change whether youre indoors outdoors or into the wind
411717 we found significant variations for early stage prostate cancer quality indicators there were differences in care from community hospitals to cancer centers to teaching hospitals there were also disparities in care from one region of the country to another but there were no racial disparities suggesting equity in care once a patient initiates treatment
411718 if these variations in care can be eliminated thereby providing uniform quality it may lead to improved outcomes for patients
411719 peristiwa ini harus menjadi pelajaran bagi kita bagaimana keamanan di negeri kita yang harus ditingkatkan

411747 sempre usei o marcos e o s rgio como meus instrutores eles sempre falaram que se eu sair de um clube grande como o palmeiras para voltar vai ser dif cil e no palmeiras eu tamb m tenho a oportunidade de jogar no time b
411748 tenho que saber da minha responsabilidade e manter uma escola de goleiros que j teve oberdan cattani valdir de morais le o velloso marcos s rgio e o diego n o f cil mas sou preparado desde quando era pequeno para isso

411752 its a little singed on the side but not too bad it gives it character
411753 the ignition point is right here i dont know if i would have woken up or not i feel very fortunate
411754 i talked to the firemen it is not advisable to go in there
411755 15 or 20 per cent of the 100 000 foreign workers who currently qualify the measures are directed mainly at low skilled workers from latin america and northern africa
411756 the problems of governance remain there have long been concerns about civic leadership there the city has suffered from a collapse of industry and has not pulled itself through the problems of deprivation
411757 all county council employees are required to provide proof of their eligibility to work in the uk
411758 there are british passport holders who live in the uk who are being found in places like kandahar
411759 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk this is something the military understands but the british public does not
411760 interpal headquartered in the uk has been a principal charity utilized to hide the flow of money to hamas reporting indicates it is the conduit through which money flows to hamas from other charities e g the al aqsa foundation and that it oversees the activities of other charities
411761 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
411762 we are determined to continue the raid until we arrest all those involved
411763 how we can finance the social security system we need certain fiscal revenues in order to maintain social security policies
411764 in many aspects this year is the time to discuss a drastic reform in the taxation system
411765 we must observe fiscal discipline but we should not leave problems that deeply concern peoples lives or their economic activities
411766 we would like to take measures to meet the situation
411767 we will have to employ countermeasures in fields such as budgetary or taxation
411768 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
411769 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
411770 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 dollars of immediate relief
411771 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
411772 what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
411773 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
411774 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
411775 we need to know exactly how mr ivins was involved if he was involved how this relates to the case and information that so far has been withheld from the american people ought to be provided
411776 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
411777 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
411778 old photostat copies from the 20s and 30s are shiny like that so this is why youd think this is not a real document
411779 you can see where theyre dipping the pen in to get more ink
411780 i would say its probably a souvenir copy done at the time and signed at the time
411781 ik ontdekte dat mijn internetgebruik plotseling enorm was toegenomen en ik kreeg hoge rekeningen
411782 we were able to clarify at a most senior level there was absolutely no shift that had occurred
411783 we believe we are moving to a point where you will be in a position to report in an unfettered way
411784 you can put things in place to prevent people from getting inside a company
411785 but how do you deal with that little logger device or some sort of device that captures important information from inside the organization
411786 it intercepts the keystrokes records them and then just passes them on to the computer
411787 its really interesting that companies are spending an inordinate amount of money trying to protect information but theyre trying to protect it from people outside the organization
411788 i think thats appropriate because there are a lot of bad guys out there but a recent study showed 80 percent of data leakage problems actually came from within i think companies are going to have to start paying attention to sensitive data within the organization getting out i think thats a huge problem

411793 the brutality and savagery shown by xing xings killers is something i have not come across before and beggars belief
411794 xing xing came from the sichuan province of china from a well respected academic family background
411795 my sympathies are with them today nothing will bring back their daughter but i hope they are able to draw some comfort from the fact that her killers have now been brought to justice

411800 se est discutiendo en que monto estamos dispuestos para invertir en vivienda
411801 en la legislatura se est discutiendo desde hace tiempo frente a una crisis habitacional cuales son las herramientas a emplear estados provincial y municipal para hacerle frente todos sacamos conclusi n de que la principal herramienta es la inversi n por lo que se est discutiendo es que monto estamos dispuestos para invertir en vivienda
411802 soy un convencido de que si uno invierte en un fondo com n con un proyecto pol tico com n sobre bases de necesidades reales de provincia y municipio la inversi n va a ser m s eficiente si cada uno hace lo que se imagina
411803 no es una retenci n de coparticipaci n sino intentar darse un proceso de inversi n com n en el marco de un proyecto com n para infraestructura de viviendas
411804 la cuesti n de distribuci n es competencia de la legislatura pero de todas maneras los proyectos que se est n discutiendo de asignaci n y la distribuci n de la inversi n intervendr n los municipios seg n se establecer expresamente
411805 la cuesti n de distribuci n de coparticipaci n es una cuesti n que es competencia de la legislatura y si uno observara la distribuci n provincia y municipio va a ver que no hay una distribuci n arbitraria sino todo lo contrario la coparticipaci n hacia los municipios es la m s alta del pa s
411806 es una posibilidad pero algunos piensan que tendr a que ser m s la verdad que cuanto m s se invierta en este tema mejor
411807 un mega generador de energ a el ctrica en la zona norte de tierra del fuego para unir mediante interconectado a las dos ciudades m s importantes
411808 la primera vez que una empresa invertir a para desarrollar un proyecto de estas caracter sticas en tierra del fuego
411809 desde el gobierno provincial realizamos los estudios de factibilidad entre ambas partes por lo que fuimos invitados a china para la firma de este convenio
411810 la organizaci n de estados productores de hidrocarburos ofhepi est tomando cartas en el asunto para escuchar los reclamos de las provincias sobre este tema
411811 lo que se pretende es lograr la modificaci n de la resoluci n 1 emitida este a o por la secretar a de energ a de la naci n y ante este planteo vamos a ver cu les ser n los pasos a seguir en los pr ximos d as
411812 si no advertimos que se pueda revertir esta situaci n vamos a realizar el reclamo como autoridad de aplicaci n provincial
411813 percibimos una mayor valoraci n del precio del crudo fueguino as que vamos a trabajar en conjunto con la ofephi y la delegaci n de hidrocarburos en capital federal para comenzar a realizar los reclamos tanto a las empresas como a las autoridades nacionales para estabilizar y establecer un precio del crudo fueguino
411814 ya est n terminando los estudios geol gicos del proyecto pero en sus aspectos administrativo y legal ya est listo por lo que creemos que vamos a estar en tiempo y forma como dijimos para llamar a licitaci n en septiembre
411815 all too often the church holds up a mirror reflecting back the society around it rather than a window revealing a different way
411816 these forces are trying all means to sabotage the beijing olympic games
411817 these terrorist groups are not as capable as some media organizations have claimed or broadcast
411818 the dramatic climax of this story is not however the suspicious victory over king miraz in battle but the discovery of the now king caspians true lineage that he too is a son of adam else he could not be qualified to reign in narnia
411819 i i dont think so sir i am only a kid
411820 if you had felt yourself sufficient it would have been a proof that you were not
411821 anyone or anything aslan or the white witch do you understand
411822 none of us knows truth about the ancient days of narnia
411823 narnia spellbound for years and years if the stories are true
411824 i mean the witch we want power and we want a power that will be on our side as for power do not the stories say that the witch defeated aslan and bound him and killed on that very stone which is over there just beyond the light
411825 yes they say but youll notice that we hear precious little about anything he did afterwards he just fades out of the story how do you explain that if he really came to life isnt it much more likely that he didnt and that the stories say nothing more about him because there was nothing more to say they say the white witch ruled for a hundred years a hundred years of winter theres power if you like theres something practical who ever heard of a witch that really died you can always get them back
411826 photography is a big part of my life as it has been for the past four years i dont see myself without the camera without thinking about photographing or without using the eye in an artistic and demanding way
411827 when i dont have a camera with me i take pictures with my eye and keep them in a good place in my mind where i can enjoy them whenever i want to and then i dont have to be disappointed about not having had my camera
411828 to me photography is about looking at and observing how daylight falls on a subject reach a beautiful grayscale or catch the right moment either with a camera or the eye
411829 there is one rule for industrialists and that is make the best quality of goods possible at the lowest cost possible paying the highest wages possible
411830 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
411831 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
411832 amazing pace the story of olympic champion michael phelps from sydney to athens to beijing
411833 michael phelps manipulated the water like no man since moses
411834 we have made our position abundantly clear to the israelis and indeed to the world not just in our public statements but in our private conversations as well
411835 there is uniformity across the u s government about the way to proceed with iran
411836 everyone from this white house including the vice presidents office is in agreement that the military option is not the best option at this point and we should pursue diplomatic and economic pressures
411837 an american commitment to deterrence especially if seen by israelis as a substitute for prevention is itself likely to spur israel to consider independent action
411838 a sophistical rhetorician inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity
411839 freedom is indivisible and when one man is enslaved all are not free
411840 the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands
411841 we have it in our power to begin the world over again
411842 physical structure of the city to new forms of living
411843 as our case is new so must we think anew and act anew
411844 i know were going to lose you but this is what the position is budgeted for
411845 i hope you keep checking with us i think youd fit in very well here
411846 the no complaining rule positive ways to deal with negativity at work
411847 with mindless complaining you are mindlessly focusing on problems however with justified complaining you identify a problem and the complaint moves you forward to a solution
411848 if you dont volunteer the information theyll have to pry it out
411849 for example the andersen incident happened in the houston office in the accounting arm of the business my r sum makes it clear i worked in the d c office in the consulting side of the business
411850 include strong detailed results oriented bullets for your job there
411851 dont minimize the work you did or the results you achieved just because the company no longer exists you still want to demonstrate how what you did there could help the company youre applying to
411852 your experience may be a talking point in an interview no matter when you worked there
411853 it has been many years since i worked at arthur andersen but interviewers love to talk about it because its both interesting and controversial
411854 be extremely professional if asked about how you feel about it or your take on what happened
411855 focus on your workplace values and how important it is to report impropriety and remain ethical at all times avoid a discussion about placing blame or berating the professionals who played a role certainly you can indicate you were disappointed in the actions some of your colleagues chose to take but focus more on what we can learn from companies and professionals in these situations
411856 focus on what you did the results that were achieved and how that experience has prepared you well for the position for which you are interviewing
411857 my salary and job expectations were in line with the nonprofit associations in which i wanted to work and i had three d c nonprofit internships under my belt and some international experience but i just couldnt seem to find anything
411858 i can say there is some real truth to having a masters or above hurting you in the job search but only if you have less than three to five years experience
411859 those with the graduate degrees always expected higher compensation and had a higher sense of entitlement to the kind of projects and level of work they should be doing most of the junior level positions tend to be very administrative thus the day to day tasks do not require a masters degree to perform well but rather an organized motivated individual
411860 why hire a grad student for 40k plus when you can hire a recent undergrad for 30k
411861 and it goes beyond just the salary the recent undergrads actually tend to perform better and stay in their job longer than the masters holders will obviously there are exceptions but generally the b a level employee will be much more eager to tackle the admin level tasks often required in this level of position generally speaking masters students come in with a somewhat inflated sense of abilities or just end up generally frustrated with the mundane tasks they are asked to do
411862 i went to graduate school got myself into xx amount of dollars of debt to do this
411863 but i think it is important that they get across in a cover letter and if it gets to this point an interview that they are more than eager to roll up their sleeves when hiring i always appreciated when candidates were upfront that while they realized the day to day wouldnt be the most glamorous of tasks they were motivated by the fact that these are necessary steps in reaching the overall goals and missions of the organization
411864 if you go straight from undergrad to grad you will be competing for jobs with recent undergrads jobs in which your masters will give you no edge and could actually be to your detriment
411865 my employer was looking for someone who could read some very technical publications and translate the information into lay terms
411866 im covering everything from robotics to wireless communications to supercomputing not a chemistry article in the whole lot
411867 he had been working at a local company and decided it was time to look for a new job he interviewed at quite a few places and was eventually hired at a local government contractor he was very happy to be offered an increase of 30 percent of his current salary he was told they really did not need him for over a month so he decided to give the typical two week notice from his old employer and then go on a two week trip to asia he had always dreamed about
411868 one month later he went to his new employer and was greeted by his new boss the man greeted him strangely and asked what he was doing there
411869 theyre being a little bit more wishy washy in their offer letters
411870 now i cant pay my mortgage i cant pay anything lights gas food so i guess im going on a diet
411871 i havent slept i havent ate ive just been crying and trying to find a way to make it work so far i havent found one
411872 i expected our legislature to do what we elected our legislature to do
411873 i feel like i was left out in the cold its a horrible mess
411874 im counting on a little bit of unemployment and trying to find a part time job since theres so many people out trying to find jobs i dont know
411875 thats despicable its outrageous he had no reason to lay off as a group some of our lowest paid workers theyre not making much anyway and now theyre making nothing
411876 its foreclosure wages we have a housing crisis here in california and it just got worse
411877 i came to the state for security and benefits look where we are it is personal i was told yesterday i have no job
411878 we just put a deposit on an apartment now we have to move out
411879 it gives you what the government wants you to know
411880 the job turned out to be selling distressed merchandise door to door in southeast d c not the nice section
411881 as soon as i found out what the story was i wanted to leave but was left stranded and had to go into a convenience store to get a cab and find my way home
411882 the position was supposed to require writing press releases planning promotions working with local media in addition to working closely with a graphic designer to produce effective advertisements
411883 after three weeks my job proved to be nothing more than programming gift cards printing distributing supplies to the restaurants including things like soy sauce and chopsticks and ordering needed promotional items
411884 one without any of the desirable characteristics that led me to take the job in the first place
411885 who am i that i should go to pharaoh and bring the israelites out of egypt
411886 the federal application process is complex to say the least
411887 its a ton of data that can be very confusing initially you cant stop at the first paragraph because if you do youre probably bypassing positions that youre qualified for
411888 the announcement gives you so much content to use if we slow down and appreciate whats in there
411889 private industry people many times do not have the qualifications for federal jobs
411890 a lot of agencies still provide descriptions of job openings that are convoluted
411891 even in the age of the web finding someone to speak with can help
411892 in fact its not uncommon to find nonprofits that fight against poverty paying their own employees impossibly low salaries
411893 if someone gave you 5 000 a month to do whatever you wanted what would it be
411894 this great purpose often places a heavy weight and even sometimes a chip on the shoulders of those doing the work
411895 the first thing most hiring managers look at when they open your r sum is your current job and current company this will most likely be the first strike against you
411896 the second thing is your education if it is solely business related it may be your second strike strike three may be a lack of numbers showing relevant scale or scope of your projects and accomplishments a huge difference between what youve done and what you want to do wont make you look like a good fit for the position
411897 when you enter a school you have to be humble
411898 instead of saying i dont agree ask what you need to do to improve
411899 you have to ask yourself three questions why an mba why now and why a particular school
411900 its quite rare to admit anyone without any work experience
411901 the best time to get an mba is when you have your act together and have something to bring to the table
411902 the worst mba classmate or project partner to endure is one who has nothing to contribute those with little experience that somehow make it through the gatekeeper in the admissions office become dead wood in class
411903 several years of knowing your industry organization and department will prove to be far more meaningful as one mba project after another come your way and in class dialogue will become more robust
411904 holds a much more advanced sense of the immediate and practical applications of the principles and disciplines imparted by business school training
411905 i think that often you reach a point in your career where you feel that you have to do even more to set yourself apart to turn it up another notch and the mba enables you to do just that
411906 fall behind on one or two assignments and its curtains
411907 the job though largely of my own design is certainly not what i see myself doing for the rest of my life and is so specialized that im afraid there is little chance of further promotion within the firm
411908 so im left with a decision of whether its time to move on or not i am tempted to leave because i do feel like i would have to get very creative in order to find further advancement and because i know there must be a job that is a better fit out there somewhere
411909 a good paycheck and a sense at work that i am valued and respected and a complete lack of ideas as to what i am now qualified to do anywhere else
411910 i tell students that a job is not a soul mate
411911 theres a lot of forgiveness out there when it comes to your choice of a first job however that starts to fade as you get into your second third fourth or even fifth job
411912 if youve only been in that job for a short time you need to be able to tell a good story about why youre leaving companies want to know if they are hiring someone whos going to stay for a while
411913 next day salary negotiation prepare tonight to get your best pay tomorrow
411914 i need to be confident that im entering into a well thought out plan with significant potential for success especially so since i have a family and need to reduce the risk of signing on with a company that could implode within a few months
411915 what im weighing mostly is whether or not this company will at best provide a satisfying job in the music industry that will grow financially and at worst keep me at a stagnant salary with the opportunity to network
411916 what theyre offering services a legitimate need that no ones really addressed theyve had success on a very small scale and are now looking to expand
411917 listening to the voice of jesus on prayer and discernment
411918 the path to adulthood for todays young adults is a full blown obstacle course of loop de loop turns and jagged edge hurdles
411919 far too often social critics place the blame squarely on our shoulders maligning everything from our work ethic to our spending habits if only it were that simple
411920 however since my position is visiting rather than tenure track i am on the academic job market again this year
411921 going to graduate school to become a college professor is much more of a crapshoot
411922 of course you want to make sure its a good article
411923 its not all curling up on the couch reading your favorite book
411924 i expect that im going to have to struggle for a few years
411925 luckily i got one of them it could have gone much much worse
411926 i get to hear about all kinds of interesting research
411927 we humbly suggest that you can do both serving god and being a political activist
411928 remember the madagascar a slave ship that reeks of the stench of death remember that god created man equal
411929 we hear that you have been struggling with whether to gods work or to change the world we suggest that you can go both
411930 i come off cool and professional but really im not when i get the slightest bit of criticism at those once a year one on one reviews all of my energy is redirected into holding back tears i dont know why it happens but i lose focus
411931 when they redid the pay structure this january my salary had to be moved just to make the minimum
411932 i need to be with it in case i am low balled
411933 i cry at the drop of a hat especially when im upset or frustrated in a discussion with someone
411934 but there have been many times where ive really had to struggle to stay composed and can definitely relate to feeling like a 12 year old
411935 write down your strengths using specific examples of projects make your successes tangible
411936 people get teary faster when they try to act like nothing is going on
411937 what i thought was going to be an incredible weakness wasnt
411938 you dont have to come in and tell the whole sob story
411939 he had been told not to tell us but many of us have families and he wanted us to know everyone appreciated what he did
411940 by telling us he is putting his job in jeopardy the directors werent supposed to mention this to the employees
411941 she has been vocal in her agitation we have asked her to keep quiet since our director would be fired if this got out but she keeps pushing
411942 he isnt regretting what he did but he is worried
411943 many times layoffs have nothing to do with your personal performance its a reflection of the company at large
411944 panic comes through in the words you choose and your body language
411945 they wonder if their skills will be relevant on the outside in many ways being in the military is like speaking another language the switch is harder the longer theyve been in
411946 i seriously do not want to have to move back in with my folks
411947 they need to understand that their skills are in demand
411948 our company is successful because our product is so good
411949 and i had absolutely no clue what was supposed to be in it
411950 are amazed that two people are doing the same job but for different pay
411951 people think what they did in the service is what they are qualified to do on the outside
411952 put your r sum together early then update it as needed
411953 the day you step off the bus at boot camp is the day you need to think about what youre doing to do when you leave
411954 what do you want to be when you grow up
411955 true for you but not for me what is the basis for morality
411956 my husband and i have serious discussions about leaving the washington area all the time due to finances
411957 we love this area and i grew up here but we worry that we cant give our future children the kind of lifestyle we want them to have a safe neighborhood a yard a bedroom of their own good schools anywhere we can afford a home in this area
411958 it would make me very sad to leave my parents who still live here but thinking of the large single family home i can buy for 200 000 in wilmington n c or indianapolis makes it a little easier to think about
411959 wed like to start a family which would require a larger living space than a studio or one bedroom condo and even the monthly mortgage payments for a two bedroom condo would have been a struggle for us especially if i had to take time off work for maternity leave
411960 were paying the same rent for our two bedroom apartment which includes most utilities in an upscale suburb as we were for our one bedroom in alexandria
411961 well be able to choose from a wide selection of reasonably priced single family homes in the area they wont be mcmansions but theyll be more than enough for a small family and for this time in our lives that is exactly what wed like
411962 im the child of two accountants and they raised me to be very frugal about finances
411963 when i was a child i loved watching sitcoms i would watch the credits at the end of the shows and wonder what all those people did to make this show happen
411964 now i can see my own name on those credits
411965 i was fascinated by their weird old instruments and the strange sounds they made
411966 around the same time i started playing the recorder and discovered bach and a few years later decided to major in music in college
411967 by then i had also decided that i wanted to be just like my music history professor a man who taught courses in music history and who directed the very group whose sounds had so captivated me at the age of 12
411968 i still say that i met that early career goal i spend my days translating the internal revenue code into english and or legalese so my clients and their attorneys can accomplish their goals and stay within the lines
411969 my stepmother has a letter she sent to her mother saying that she was sure i was going to be an accountant since i was more interested in how many stamps i had in my collection than their value
411970 i have been a nurse for 34 years i have never wanted to be or do anything else since the first day i walked into the hospital as a candy striper
411971 not as a conscious career choice but as a realization of what i enjoyed doing
411972 i have been a social worker now for almost 20 years and have loved every minute of it
411973 be mindful that while your companys lack of preparation for your arrival may seem disorganized or downright rude they may be testing to see how you adapt do you proactively seek out the equipment you need or sit helplessly and twiddle your thumbs are you relaxed and accommodating or do you throw a hissy fit because your already inundated colleagues didnt drop everything to make sure your work space was wrapped up for you in a pretty red bow
411974 no matter what you are working on odds are that others have walked a similar path it will save you and your company time money and effort if you can identify and build upon existing work and resources
411975 its very important to gather feedback during the first weeks on the job
411976 imagine your horror to learn after six months on the job that you are actually not performing up to others expectations its always easier to seek feedback than to have someone tell you out of the blue that you are not doing well because then you are not psychologically prepared for the news good or bad
411977 communication is much more than what comes out of your mouth
411978 yes lord walking in the way of your truth we wait eagerly for you for your name and renown are the desire of our souls
411979 yes lord walking in the way of your truth we wait eagerly for you for your name and your renown are the desire of our souls
411980 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
411981 it will depend on the business arrangements that are in place
411982 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
411983 but the real satisfaction is knowing the vaccine is back on line
411984 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
411985 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
411986 the sad truth is that the fcc is ill equipped to detect isps interfering with your internet connection
411987 its up to concerned internet users to investigate possible network neutrality violations and effs switzerland software is designed to help with that effort comcast isnt the first and certainly wont be the last isp to meddle surreptitiously with its subscribers internet communications for its own benefit
411988 lamentablemente la historia se repite una vez m s el gobierno provincial quiere avanzar sobre la autonom a municipal
411989 desde el municipio nos vemos en la obligaci n de extremar las medidas administrativas y legales para que la comuna de r o grande pueda cobrar la totalidad de los fondos retenidos por el gobierno provincial en la gesti n de c ccaro y r os
411990 mientras los municipios presentaron una postura pol tica clara para aportar y ayudar a encontrar una soluci n definitiva a la crisis habitacional a trav s de utilizaci n de las acreencias que tienen los municipios sobre el gobierno provincial y destinar directamente a soluciones habitacionales hoy nos encontramos con una limitaci n en la capacidad de ejecuci n de obra que ten an planificadas las comunas
411991 esta postura que ya fue anunciada por los intendentes y confirmada a trav s de algunas medidas legislativas tiene un asidero concreto puesto que ya se ha demostrado que los municipios tienen una gran capacidad de respuesta para contrarrestar esta crisis con lo que es la urbanizaci n y entrega de terrenos
411992 estas propuestas que han hecho los municipios no significan la creaci n de nuevos fondos sino s lo la utilizaci n de las acreencias en pos de disminuir la crisis habitacional
411993 con esta medida no s lo no se estar an cobrando las acreencias sino que adem s se estar a diezmando la posibilidad de ejecutar un plan de obra p blica para ser un complemento en la lucha contra la crisis habitacional
411994 lamentablemente la historia se repite una vez m s el gobierno provincial quiere avanzar sobre la autonom a municipal
411995 ya ha ocurrido en los gobiernos de manfredotti colazo y c ccaro
411996 en este caso se lleg a un grado superlativo de avance sobre las autonom as municipales
411997 sin duda es una herramienta muy cuestionable ya que se plantea la generaci n de recursos ociosos cuando en realidad no existe un proyecto concreto para la utilizaci n de estos fondos en infraestructura y s lo existe una simple expresi n de deseo
411998 plan de trabajo en el cual se establezcan cuales son las necesidades se realiza un proyecto de urbanizaci n se explica cual es la necesidad concreta y luego se buscan los fondos
411999 lo nico que se va hacer con la b squeda primero de fondos y luego ver que es lo que se puede hacer con esos fondos es generar un gran capital de dinero ocioso en una provincia que tiene muchas necesidades b sicas
412000 con este fondo de afectaci n espec fica lo nico que se hace es limitar a los municipios para la ejecuci n de obras
412001 sin duda lo que primero se ver afectado es el plan de obra p blica
412002 es lamentable que se tenga que realizar esto porque el crecimiento que est n viviendo las dos principales ciudades de la provincia es m s que marcado y retrasar o postergar la realizaci n de obras p blicas esenciales sin duda perjudicar a todos los vecinos de la ciudad
412003 si hablamos de la disminuci n de un 10 por ciento en los ingresos por coparticipaci n provincial estamos hablando de un monto m s que importante el cual llegar a a caso unos 8 o 9 millones de pesos lo cual ser a un equivalente a la disminuci n de un 30 por ciento en el presupuesto concreto de obra p blica
412004 los municipios han demostrado una gran capacidad de respuesta para establecer soluciones concretas a la crisis habitacional tal es el caso del municipio de r o grande que invirti m s de 27 millones de pesos en la urbanizaci n de la chacra xi donde se entregaron casi 600 lotes
412005 con este fondo de afectaci n espec fica lo nico que se hace es limitar a los municipios para la ejecuci n de obras
412006 en virtud del recorte de fondos que esto implica desde el municipio nos vemos en la obligaci n de extremar las medidas administrativas y legales para que la comuna de r o grande pueda cobrar la totalidad de los fondos de coparticipaci n que fueron retenidos por el gobierno provincial en la gesti n de c ccaro y r os

412008 what do you mean what abortion really is isnt that obvious
412009 we want people to see the faces of reproductive choice in canada
412010 blame the guilt they experience on the anti choice movement
412011 forget about the dow jones industrial average returning to 11 000 try depression era levels below 1 000 and dont flock to bonds for safety municipalities will default and corporate bonds will be wracked by downgrades even the u s governments credit status may sink low enough to make treasury bills shaky if you believe in such gloomy prophecies you probably know about robert prechter jr who is now undergoing a renaissance his book conquer the crash you can survive and prosper in a deflationary depression which warns of a looming economic cataclysm reached the top of amazon coms financial bestseller list in 2002 his two main monthly newsletters have increased their subscriber base by more than 50 percent
412012 solo per questa volta ti devo dire una cosa seria
412013 scusa devi proprio entrare in casa vengo io sul balcone se proprio una cosa seria e facciamola finita
412014 no no non possibile qualcuno potrebbe sentirmi come tu sai gli inquilini di questo palazzo hanno votato tutti per berlusconi tu vuoi la mia rovina ed anche la tua
412015 io so cosa significano i tuoi coleos ma non mi sembra che tu ne abbia a sufficienza se ti rifiuti di parlare con me che sono il tuo amico pi fedele
412016 e di che ti lamenti solo cos riesci ad avere un po di visibilit cosa cui tieni in modo particolare
412017 dai entra e spera che non ti veda mia moglie altrimenti sono cavoli tuoi e miei
412018 cosa c di tanto misterioso da dirmelo come se stessimo in confessionale
412019 ma quali solite barzellette e poi io non ho mai detto barzellette sono un cane serio come carneade sconosciuto quanto vuoi ma serio di cui ho il nome come sai e come si dice berlusconi diventato pi buono dopo la sua vittoria schiacciante alla competizione elettorale del 13 e 14 aprile scorso pu anche permetterselo del resto chi gli fa pi ombra nemmeno il papa se riuscito a non nominare un solo uno solo dico ministro cattolico e tutto il suo buonismo e le sue aperture verso gli avversari veltroni in particolare non tendono a farsi eleggere capo dello stato in un prossimo futuro no le sue mire vanno ben oltre
412020 ecco perch non esco quasi mai e poi dici di essermi affezionato non vero mi sopporti ed io che mi preoccupo di metterti a conoscenza degli avvenimenti che cambieranno anzi sconvolgeranno gli scenari politici universali
412021 e chi le vuole le tue carezze e i tuoi baci io sono un cane dignitoso che non ha bisogno di salamelecchi e cose varie ma almeno un po di rispetto lo pretendo
412022 ci stiamo avvitando su di un argomento che non ha nulla a che vedere con quello che hai annunciato di dirmi e per quanto riguarda il rispetto il mio lo hai tutto e anche profondo ma ora vai avanti
412023 devi sapere che noi cani siamo collegati tra di noi pi di internet e sappiamo tutto di tutti chi pi vicino agli uomini pi potenti della terra noi bush si porta il cane anche nello studio ovale quando intrattiene i capi di stato e cos fanno tutti gli altri poi le notizie pi segrete ce le trasmettiamo tra di noi facendo il giro del mondo e tu mio ingrato e ingeneroso padrone hai il privilegio di possedere un cane parlante che per te farebbe qualunque cosa anche il delatore
412024 s ti ringrazio ma fino a questo momento non mi hai rivelato nulla ci siamo solo perduti in chiacchiere e in pettegolezzi finora non mi hai detto nulla di interessante e segreto che berlusconi voglia diventare il futuro presidente italiano scritto su tutti i giornali anche se smentisce dov la novit
412025 ascolta e vedrai se non una bomba la notizia che sto per darti berlusconi vuole diventare papa
412026 ah ah ah questa bella non me la potevi raccontare pi grossa devo ammettere per che hai una fantasia fervidissima questa la barzelletta pi bella del secolo
412027 ridi ridi quando ti dir quello che succeder e come succeder fra qualche tempo non ti far tanto ridere
412028 va bene ti credo vai avanti e finiamola con questa storia stamattina non mi sono alzato troppo per la quale non vorrei stare peggio
412029 sembra che berlusconi si sia messo in contatto diretto con il padreterno il quale gli ha chiesto la cortesia di prendere nelle sue mani le redini della chiesa visto che una specie di re mida tutto quello che tocca diventa oro
412030 ma che dici e vero che anche questa notizia apparsa sui giornali ma se credi a tutto quello che leggi sei un ingenuo
412031 hai la testa dura ma dura assai il signore si sta guardando in giro per la terra e si accorge che i mussulmani crescono i buddisti pure addirittura i testimoni di geova ma i cattolici restano al palo chi pu ribaltare la situazione secondo te dopo il sacrificio del suo unico figlio
412032 silvio su questo sono daccordo con te ma come possibile che avvenga e questo il punto
412033 carneade questa mattina mi sono divertito abbastanza facciamo finta di aver avuto una bella ed allegra conversazione e finiamola qua
412034 ci vorr molto tempo e unoperazione di lunga durata non pu avvenire in pochi anni ci vorranno almeno un centinaio di anni ti figuri il silvio fra cento anni come sar
412035 se ci volesse tanto tempo non cambierebbe molto fisicamente con tutti i sistemi che gi adotta per mantenersi giovane ma non ci vorr molto appena cinque anni
412036 e tu pensi che silvio accetterebbe di fare il papa per soli cinque anni non accetterebbe mai egli si sente e si crede immortale non mi sembra fattibile per cos poco tempo
412037 e invece sembra che accetter perch appena passer a miglior vita sar proclamato
412038 e il padreterno scenderebbe a questi compromessi non ci credo
412039 se il signore vuole una chiesa potente ringiovanita e sovrana di tutta la terra questo piccolo compromesso cosa vuoi che sia e gi stato stipulato il contratto
412040 lo sapevo che eravate qui ecco perch ogni mattina ti alzi presto per far entrare questo sgorbio in cucina ma allora non hai capito nulla se vi trovo in casa una seconda volta potrete fare le valigie e andare a dormire sotto qualche ponte che il vostro luogo ideale in casa appena sopporto te figuriamoci il cane e tu vai nel giardino in cui non metter mai piede finch ci sarai tu
412041 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
412042 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
412043 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
412044 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
412045 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them
412046 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic
412047 its really a question of the extent of the delusion
412048 the delusions we typically treat are narrow there is capgras delusion where someone will think his family has been replaced by doubles or the fregoli delusion where someone believes that one person is persecuting him a doctor mailman butcher the truman show delusion though involves the entire world
412049 i never heard people say the godfather thats my life
412050 voor hem is het werk maar voor de overige vier is het vrije tijd
412051 these faculty members and citizens each picked a college to watch and have begun to look into whether that college conducts politicized teaching requires ideological adherence or sustains slights to conservative students
412052 in defense of nas theres absolutely nothing wrong with monitoring what colleges do and protecting the rights of students and faculty is a good thing
412053 however what makes the monitoring by nas wrong is the ideological nature of it
412054 as i argue in my book patriotic correctness its time for progressives to form an activist organization that will monitor violations of liberty on campuses especially the campuses ignored by the right wing groups and protect the intellectual freedom of right wingers left wingers and everyone in between if youre interested in helping with this whether youre conservative or liberal please contact me at collegefreedom yahoo com
412055 liberal students deserve as much protection from abuse as do conservative ones though given the overall state of academe the latter are typically in a far more exposed position than the former were glad john wilson would like to be a collaborator in the effort to defend academic freedom but he needs to attain greater conceptual clarity before hes likely to be a useful one
412056 if youd like to talk with me you can talk with me at work
412057 i saw lopez caught up in the gears the teeth of the foot masher
412058 his left hand was stuck all the way to the wrist
412059 they graciously proceeded with the informal conference despite my tardiness i told them that their time was worth a reduction in penalty they have taken various steps since the inspection to abate the hazard they asked if they could send information on what they have done and get a penalty reduction based on that information i said sure we ended our phone conversation
412060 it was just a matter of quibbling over a couple hundred bucks thats all
412061 its not something thats unusual but then again its not something thats routine
412062 in 2007 iowa osha issued 19 violations for all meatpacking plants in iowa with fines totaling over 120 000
412063 people coming there looking for jobs they bring id with a photo with a number
412064 nineteen million illegals here i dont bring em here i pay taxes and the government is supposed to control the stuff
412065 het klinkt verantwoordelijk enzo en en en straks word je nog helemaal volwassen enzo
412066 its attorneys are reviewing the paperwork pertaining to the federal action today
412067 the majority today forecloses the availability of additional compensation for severely injured workers solely because they lack permanent residency status or authorization to work in this country ignoring the history of our workers compensation law and this states commitment to protect all workers irrespective of immigration status
412068 old photostat copies from the 20s and 30s are shiny like that so this is why youd think this is not a real document
412069 you can see where theyre dipping the pen in to get more ink
412070 i would say its probably a souvenir copy done at the time and signed at the time
412071 the largest single site operation of its kind in american history
412072 have you seen the news there was an immigration raid yesterday at 10am they have some 400 detainees here well be working late conducting initial appearances for the next few days
412073 when i saw what it was really about my heart sank
412074 the humanitarian impact of this raid is obvious to anyone in postville the economic impact will soon be evident
412075 interpreters shall disclose any real or perceived conflict of interest and shall not serve in any matter in which they have a conflict of interest
412076 i walked for a month and ten days until i crossed the river
412077 i just wanted to work a year or two save and then go back to my family but it was not to be
412078 the good lord knows i was just working and not doing anyone any harm
412079 god knows you are just doing your job to support your families and that job is to keep me from supporting mine
412080 i cannot be away from my children for so long
412081 if you want to see your children or dont want your family to starve sign here
412082 your honor you know that we are here because of the need of our families i beg that you find it in your heart to send us home before too long because we have a responsibility to our children to give them an education clothing shelter and food
412083 i appreciate the fact that you are very hard working people who have come here to do no harm and i thank you for coming to this country to work hard unfortunately you broke a law in the process and now i have the obligation to give you this sentence but i hope that the u s government has at least treated you kindly and with respect and that this time goes by quickly for you so that soon you may be reunited with your family and friends
412084 your honor i am concerned from my attorney client interviews that many of these people are clearly not guilty and yet they have no choice but to plead out
412085 you know i dont agree with any of this or with the way it is being done in fact i ruled in a previous case that to charge somebody with identity theft the person had to at least know of the real owner of the social security number but i was reverted in another district and yet upheld in a third
412086 however the numbers did not match the name of the employee reported by agriprocessors
412087 this analysis would not account for the possibility that a person may have falsely used the identity of an actual persons name and ssn
412088 in my training and expertise i know it is not uncommon for aliens to purchase identity documents which include ssns that match the name assigned to the number
412089 the search revealed that a person who was assigned one of the social security numbers used by an employee of agriprocessors has reported his her identity being stolen
412090 on april 16 2008 the us filed criminal complaints against 697 employees charging them with unlawfully using ssns in violation of title 42 usc 408 a 7 b aggravated identity theft in violation of 18 usc 1028a a 1 and or possession or use of false identity documents for purposes of employment in violation of 18 usc 1546
412091 knowingly uses a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit any unlawful activity or felony
412092 as a law enforcement agency for the post 9 11 era to integrate enforcement authorities against criminal and terrorist activities including the fights against human trafficking and smuggling violent transnational gangs and sexual predators who prey on children
412093 to prevent prepare for and respond to a wide range of catastrophic incidents including terrorist attacks natural disasters pandemics and other such significant events that require large scale government and law enforcement response
412094 in fy07 ice human trafficking investigations resulted in 164 arrests and 91 convictions
412095 ice has introduced an aggressive and effective campaign to enforce immigration law within the nations interior with a top level focus on criminal aliens fugitive aliens and those who pose a threat to the safety of the american public and the stability of american communities
412096 knowingly possessing or using false employment documents with intent to deceive
412097 in fy07 ice dramatically increased penalties against employers whose hiring processes violated the law securing fines and judgments of more than 30 million
412098 these incarcerated aliens have been involved in dangerous criminal activity such as murder predatory sexual offenses narcotics trafficking alien smuggling and a host of other crimes

412187 information of this attack was shared very late with pakistan this was a case where the u s did not want to alert the pakistanis in advance because of concerns over information leaks
412188 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
412189 what the u s wants is a revamp especially among the isis units which deal with areas along the afghan border additionally the u s wants to see new structures in place for closer oversight on people in the field basically within the isi there has to be a strong internal affairs unit of a kind

412196 die wiener stadtregierung hat durch ihre verantwortungsbewusste und vorausblickende politik schon vor jahren in der bundeshauptstadt einen umschwung der damals sterreichweiten schwierigen arbeitsmarktlage eingeleitet und auch nun ist wien f r ein bevorstehendes langsameres wachstum ger stet und hat bereits entsprechende impulse gesetzt neben investitionen in den arbeitsmarkt und die wirtschafts und forschungsf rderung werden zahlreiche ma nahmen gesetzt um arbeitspl tze f r die menschen dieser stadt aber auch aus den bundesl ndern zu schaffen und zu erhalten und durch diese vorausschauende politik unterscheidet sich die sp grundlegend von der tatenlosigkeit der vp etwa eines arbeitsministers bartenstein

412220 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
412221 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
412222 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
412223 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
412224 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
412225 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
412226 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
412227 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

412238 os que n o foram julgados at agora respondem pelo crime de forma o de quadrilha que j est prescrito

412243 o engra ado que ele trabalhava numa gr fica e gostava mesmo era de usar terno e gravata e n o coturnos
412244 naquela mesma noite em que mataram o edson o mesmo grupo havia espancado outras duas pessoas
412245 apenas tr s deles vanderlei de s juliano sabino e henrique velasco s o nacionalistas por convic o e odeiam homossexuais judeus e drogados
412246 ocorre quase sempre de os agredidos n o denunciarem os ataques porque tamb m s o discriminados pelos policiais
412247 continuamos com um n mero alto de homossexuais assassinados foram 125 mortes anuais em m dia desde o ano 2000 segundo o grupo gay da bahia
412248 mas no congresso nacional n o tivemos ainda a aprova o da lei que visa tipificar e punir a discrimina o por orienta o sexual embora o projeto de lei j tenha sido aprovado na c mara dos deputados e atualmente esteja na comiss o de direitos humanos do senado federal
412249 atuamos muito proximamente da secretaria estadual de seguran a p blica e o resultado foi a pris o de 13 skinheads
412250 nesse caso n o se trata de uma quest o de conscientiza o mas sim de repress o
412251 quando recebemos uma den ncia a encaminhamos para a pol cia
412252 como as que s o profissionais do sexo trabalham geralmente em um ponto fixo elas temem ser alvo de retalia o caso denunciem agressores principalmente quando o caso envolve viol ncia policial
412253 a marginaliza o das travestis e transexuais come a muitas vezes dentro da pr pria fam lia e permeia as atividades do dia a dia eu por exemplo mesmo tendo renda para alugar um apartamento n o conseguia por ser transexual cheguei a ser recusada em 40 tentativas s consegui porque meu pai fez a loca o para mim sem que eu fosse identificada
412254 at mesmo pela maior visibilidade pela facilidade de identific las elas se tornam um alvo preferencial
412255 houve bastante discuss o mas por isso mesmo acredito que foi enriquecedor para os dois lados porque reduziu preconceitos e a incompreens o
412256 cidadania n o s obriga o do estado mas do cidad o
412257 n o adianta discutir sobre as minorias que est o erradas dos dois lados

412263 eles mesmos nos avisam quais s o os pontos da cidade ou da estrada onde podem acontecer confrontos e nos ajudam a monitorar as convoca es para brigas pela internet
412264 cada grupo desses tem um s l der que muitas vezes estimula a viol ncia mas n o participa dela quando outros passam a se destacar passam a ser discriminados ou afastados do grupo se tiverem for a podem criar uma dissid ncia no bando original

412290 the trailer started out with a large flyover of a savannah like setting by one of the multicolored ships
412291 the trailer started out with a quote stating that this game is
412292 nothing is either good or bad but thinking makes it so
412293 the trailer initially started out with one of those grainy film filters that seemed reminiscent of classic newsreel footage it presented a flyover of a map that showed off different kingdoms and highlighted one militaristic nation that due to the machinations and speeches of its leader began invasions of its neighbors apparently its march to war was unimpeded until it reached a lone island kingdom isolated from the rest of the continent which appeared to be protected by a giant crystal however it does appear as though the crystal eventually shatters leaving the kingdom unprotected and seemingly defenseless that is until a mysterious woman clad in a cloak emerged in front of the army wielding both a whip like sword reminiscent of soulcaliburs ivy and other blades while the trailer focused on quick flashes of gameplay interspersed with cg cutscenes the trailer eventually ended with the cloaked woman planting a flag which appeared to be the colors of the invaded island nation this rallied many other cloaked figures to arise and take up arms against their attackers whoever this resistance group is they all look rather dangerous with their own specialization of different weapons the trailer then ends while we were left with many more questions than answers this definitely put the title on our radar whenever it is released on psps
412294 well weve just released a new album and its called well from first to last like us does anybody have it
412295 i cant believe ive just met two famous people and its my first show
412296 i said you had ten minutes not forty come on lets go
412297 i watched alisons athens on television and it tickled the nerves a little bit
412298 it wasnt until the winter of that year that i decided to have a go
412299 it was about 1994 when my performance dipped a bit because i wasnt training
412300 i just didnt really enjoy it anymore then one year turns into two then its 10 and by that time youre far behind everybody else
412301 id been shooting well but before i got back in the team again the other guys were never in britain and i couldnt compare myself against them
412302 my scores were good but i liked to see how good they were against these guys
412303 and then i got picked for the team and off i went its been a good little progression
412304 in 1992 we didnt have any holding camp we went straight into the village for a month and there was a fair bit to do but you just shot too much generally i found
412305 now its a lot better because were in a harsher climate to beijing
412306 the olympic games is the worlds largest stage and the worlds biggest television event
412307 im delighted that tvnz can bring new zealanders the whole dramatic spectacle live free to air and on a choice of screens

412309 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
412310 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt

412312 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
412313 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
412314 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
412315 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
412316 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
412317 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
412318 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
412319 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
412320 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
412321 tennant says he doesnt want to sound unsympathetic but reminds digital music buyers that cd owners dont demand a refund from stores when they lose their discs as for backing up songs to a cd people should just accept the loss of quality because the only other alternative is to lose the music entirely he said
412322 its a nice feeling to not have to look at it every day
412323 i know im out there so thats what i focus on
412324 they had guys in place i came in and didnt really know my role at first i think i found one but this is different im playing every day ive got 400 plate appearances already this season i think had about 150 total in two years with the mariners
412325 he knows hes going to play and hes able to relax and just let his talent take over
412326 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
412327 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
412328 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
412329 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
412330 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it
412331 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by 2 tenths of a second those guys are looking pretty potent right now
412332 i think weve gone in the right direction there has been a lot of hard work throughout all of hendrick motorsports and its nice to see it coming together im glad i did my job and hit my marks its a very technical track a lot like indy where its easy to miss one of the corners
412333 right now our first goal is that weve got to make the chase
412334 one thing im proud of this team for is we never want to be fat and happy with six races until the start of the chase theres a lot of time for other guys to figure things out we need to act like a top five team and run like a top five team well reflect on what we accomplished at the end of the year so lets just stay hungry
412335 dont forget just as 48 has risen theres someone else whos going to rise before chase time
412336 i wanted to make a birdie so bad i could spit
412337 thats the way the golf went i never made anything happen
412338 jack nicklaus isnt here so i guess thats a substitute
412339 because it would be pretty scary if it got a little panicky and some spectator or some of the golfers were too close that wouldnt have been an issue if a caddie had gotten too close
412340 it is going to be the closest thing to a game environment so you do step it up a little more
412341 we are going to be hitting it is going to be live so you are a little geeked up but you still want to stay focused and stay in touch with your fundamentals you dont want to go out there and just forget everything just because you are excited
412342 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
412343 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do

412345 we made some aerodynamic changes to the boat and then we wanted to wait until the end of the session and let the winds come to us maybe

412350 mr schultz told me that he did not believe the city had obtained in the settlement a sufficient commitment from the nba to locate a new team in seattle at some point in the future
412351 i explained to him that such a promise could not be made because these were issues for future deliberations of committees of the nba board of governors and the board itself

412357 she has two rotts already and deux doesnt get along well with her older dog he is a sweetheart and a huge goofball

412360 an 89 year old lady in haltom city found her starving in her front yard july 10 and was kind enough to take her in get her to a vet and keep her for 3 weeks while she recovered
412361 after a trainer at petsmart contacted a rescue group i work with bob and i went out to the petsmart in hurst to meet simba and the lady who rescued her
412362 as the lady was leading simba into the store simba pulled out of her collar and ran we ran for hours looking for her and by a miracle she didnt get hit by a car and an animal control officer who just happened to be in the area picked her up we had called them for help in catching her so they
412363 bob and i are fostering her until we can find her a permanent home we have a 12 pound dog who is afraid of simba and has been hiding under furniture since shes been with us or we would keep her ourselves were very fond of her
412364 she is a very sweet loving dog she loves to run and play house trained heartworm negative and has had her first round of shots
412365 she walks on a leash she needs to be with a rescue group or an experienced dog owner to help her become less afraid probably an active family with no other pets or pets her size she weighs 34 lbs now but she needs to gain about 10 pounds so she will be a 45 50 lb dog she
412366 this is a very special dog that has great potential to be a wonderful pet for the right family
412367 there is a mill not far from me that is wanting to down size they are giving up their yorkies and pugs i have found a rescue to take the pugs but i have not found a yorkie rescue do you know of any small dog rescue around you north texas or beyond that might have room for some of these yorkies like most millers they will not give me a number yet the only information that i have is that the dogs are between 2 and 6 years of age and are up to date on their shots
412368 at the end it was a case of calculating the distance and the timing and i got it right
412369 i have an appointment to fulfill a dream to be in the olympics

412521 giving voice to the struggles of the african working class from around the world
412522 in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country

412532 by next year at this time we may be saying rush who
412533 he bills himself as a conservative although thinking conservatives after an initial chuckle or two should want to put as much distance between him and themselves as possible
412534 his favorite technique for discrediting an idea with which he disagrees is to make petty personal attacks against the people who espouse that idea
412535 he is not a nice man and he doesnt pretend to be and hes nasty
412536 limbaugh reminds us of morton downey jr the celebrated tv hatemonger of a few years ago

412540 i refer to the long foreseen crisis in prisons and the howls of alarm from all those forces and individuals who have the solution at their fingertips it is quite simply this let the women go the government should close womens prisons down forthwith they could then use the buildings to house the male prisoners
412541 how to solve the prisons crisis release all the whites to make more room for blacks
412542 all research by penal reformers tends to the view that it is totally inappropriate to slam women when other ways of dealing with them help avoid their re offending
412543 crime is one human activity where there is a clear difference between men and women
412544 after six young women committed suicide within one year at just one prison styal in cheshire they the government were forced to take notice following a fawcett society report in april about the very same subject the matter could be delayed no longer earlier this year baroness corston was asked to conduct a review of vulnerable women in the criminal justice system
412545 in 2005 there were 78 suicides in prison this included four women and 12 prisoners under 21 years old the proportion of suicides by black and minority ethnic prisoners has risen from one in ten of all prison suicides in the last five years to over one in five during 2005
412546 radical proposals to close all 13 womens jails in england and wales and replace them with small house units holding up to 20 offenders were today rejected by the government todays announcement is a bitter blow to penal reform groups who had put their trust in key female members of the government my emphasis instead the ministry of justice highlighted initiatives to support women including pilot projects in five jails in which a new search technique is being used which does not require them to remove their underwear
412547 baroness corston proposed closing womens jails and replacing them with a network of small units located in city centres and run by
412548 but even as her report was published last year ministry of justice sources made clear there was no money to implement such an ambitious and controversial proposal
412549 prison is certainly not one of the places where women aspire to equal treatment
412550 last year 87 200 women and girls were arrested for attacks the equivalent of 240 every day it is the first time in history that violence has been the most common crime among women and girls taking over from theft

412552 id rather forget a portion of quran than make a grammatical mistake
412553 learn arabic as it is from your way of life learn your religious obligations as they also are from your way of life
412554 develop a grammatically sound understanding of the quran for no doubt it is meant to be in arabic
412555 no one should be teaching the quran except the one who knows the language well
412556 teach your children arabic like you teach them to memorize quran
412557 following the unprovoked and callous murder of mr kok foss high school and the surrounding community were l eft in disorganized panic which was indicative of the shocking neglect by the tacoma school district in the areas of both preventing and responding to school violence
412558 its added a large number to our population and also costs
412559 there is no medicare subsidy for somebody who is incarcerated
412560 we pay 100 percent of the bill as a result the prison system costs 50 billion per year to incarcerate people in the united states which is four times what it cost 20 years ago in the next five years it is projected to increase by 25 billion
412561 we have to forget about being tough or soft on crime we have to be smart on crime in the future because it costs too much money
412562 there are one million more beds across the country than 20 years ago yet the average length of stay has only extended by six months that equates to a lot of non violent low level offenders
412563 for a lot of years it was lock them up and throw away the key thats not going to make that person a better person when they come out and are your neighbor
412564 some welcome us with open arms as a system we have not done a good job of getting out there and talking to businesses so we are doing that better now
412565 every person released has a parole officer attached to them
412566 so if they are showing up late the business calls the parole officer its something a regular employee doesnt come with
412567 its not one size fits all in the court system anymore
412568 when we talk about crimes and new legislation comes through we have to think about the sentencing of that crime and what impact it might have on our system
412569 drug abusers the mentally ill those nobody knows what to do with are now living in a prison cell habitual offenders who are arrested for driving offenses someone may have to drive for their job get a little crazy one day and as a habitual offender they end up in state prison i dont know that they belong there they go in a good guy with maybe a speeding problem and come out a criminal
412570 as we all know his conduct was outrageous and clearly life threatening
412571 the fact is he is likely to spend the rest of his life in a high security
412572 we will now get him and our prosecution will go on
412573 after 38 years in this business i have no feelings
412574 well get him back our court will appoint doctors to examine him and we will see what they say and determine how were going handle it
412575 happy he is going to get help rather than prison
412576 he knew exactly what he did he told me exactly what he did
412577 let the court see what the hell he did she has a life sentence to a wheelchair
412578 i cant imagine that place not being there to help people
412579 the commission is very concerned we feel its the wrong decision

412587 we believe the technology has great promise as a much more effective treatment regimen for certain types of diseases of the brain
412588 the singular feature of the great crash of 1929 was that the worst continued to worsen what looked one day like the end proved on the next day to have been only the beginning nothing could have been more ingeniously designed to maximize the suffering and also to ensure that as few as possible escaped the common misfortune the fortunate speculator who had funds to answer the first margin call presently got another and equally urgent one and if he met that there would still be another in the end all the money he had was extracted from him and lost the man with the smart money who was safely out of the market when the first crash came naturally went back in to pick up bargains not only were a recorded 12 894 650 shares sold on 24 october precisely the same number were bought the bargains then suffered a ruinous fall even the man who waited out all of october and all of november who saw the volume of trading return to normal and saw wall street become as placid as a produce market and who then bought common stocks would see their value drop to a third or a fourth of the purchase price in the next twenty four months the coolidge bull market was a remarkable phenomenon the ruthlessness of its liquidation was in its own way equally remarkable

412595 important role in making the cpi m the largest contingent of the left movement in the country surjeet absorbed marxism leninism by sheer dint of self study and learning from experience he always stressed the fundamental importance of critically examining the partys ideological and political positions on the basis of marxism
412596 the most authoritative spokesman for the left and democratic forces in the country
412597 he worked tirelessly for the defence of democratic and secular values and to see that india maintained its non aligned and independent foreign policy his views were sought and his advice was heard with respect in political circles
412598 his was a life long fight against communalism he was one of the first leaders who recognised the threat posed by the rise of the communal forces to the secular principle of the indian state he played a crucial role in 1989 1996 and 2004 in creating the political formations and the setting up of governments which excluded the communal forces
412599 the prime minister has suggested that a joint working mechanism intelligence sharing between the cbi and state police is required
412600 people have been joining the cbi from other organisations but they do not have the requisite expertise to handle crime cases the standard of people joining from other organisations is declining
412601 it is a government agency and it cannot say no to any state government if a case is transferred to it

412625 it doesnt have to be a big sculpture in a park i thought that it could be really small like this if the birds were placed all over the city so people could find them and engage with them
412626 to be a bird is to have the freedom to take flight

412658 si mi basta mi basta di tre cose ero del tutto certa
412659 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
412660 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
412661 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
412662 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

412680 auch sollten wir uns einig sein daraus keine parteipolitische debatte zu machen
412681 im not super skinny i have curves and they belong on my body i put on two stone for
412682 i hated being fat but i also hated being so thin i went down to a size 6 and i just felt completely uncomfortable i remember being cold and wrapping my arms around my body and feeling ribs and bone i felt totally unsexy
412683 women have to work out what makes them feel comfortable whether its about their weight or their clothes i dont have hang ups about the way i look i can see myself in the mirror when im all done up and think i look pretty hot but i can see myself every day and see this round dutch doll face

412686 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that th there talking about getting off drilling if everyone was just inflating there tires and and yes he stammers a lot regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
412687 he has had unfair criticism but unfair criticism stops quickly if you get good results i think that kind of opinion changes quickly
412688 he is not at the end of his career he is in the middle of his career and i believe it is a good opportunity for him to show his quality
412689 it was a big disappointment in the country missing out on euro 2008 you get a lot of hard criticism in england and some managers have problems recovering from that
412690 as soon as i joined twente i knew we had the draw coming up and strangely i expected one of the english teams i think fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this draw
412691 the objective is for us to progress so we will try and like the boss says i think we have the quality to compete in this league
412692 we will show everyone and if we progress we have the chance to win the league
412693 of course man u and chelsea are strong sides as are liverpool and tottenham they are building new teams but i am really confident with the quality we have got and i cant wait for the season to start it is going to be an exciting one and we will be up for it
412694 for me it is different because the boss is french and he brought me here i dont know many managers in football but i think he is one of the best
412695 to work with a manager like him and players like cesc and robin we are all around 22 to 25 and it is a dream to play for arsenal so all the ingredients are all together to progress well as a footballer personally and as a team
412696 i had a chance and should have scored which would have killed the game and i am upset with myself because in training i always make the keeper work i didnt this time
412697 there were other chances but now move on and we have to get back on par with how we played in other games
412698 i was nervous walking up even though it was only a friendly tournament we practiced them the day before and i just stuck with what i had done there i took a side footer and hit the post the rest i drilled into the bottom corner so i did that
412699 it was disappointing and we keep losing on penalties were not happy about it
412700 its nice for the boss to say i am an important part of the squad and im not really a person to quit on anything either
412701 i can fight for my place as long as i am here and will continue to do so
412702 my room is everyones meeting point so were just chilling and having some banter it brings us all together weve been mainly playing computer games
412703 there are a few bad players but i wont mention any names joe cole has been mentioned previously i think but he has done okay
412704 i know that it will not be easy to win the first team spot but i will do my best
412705 differently than last year now i have more motivations and during training im working well
412706 we have not made any formal offer for the player
412707 old photostat copies from the 20s and 30s are shiny like that so this is why youd think this is not a real document
412708 you can see where theyre dipping the pen in to get more ink
412709 i would say its probably a souvenir copy done at the time and signed at the time
412710 go again love a woman who is loved by her husband yet an adulteress even as the lord loves the sons of israel though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes
412711 you shall stay with me for many days you shall not play the harlot nor shall you have a man so i will also be toward you
412712 how many dumps did i have to take today i took a lot of dumps today
412713 i hired a campaign manager to win the servant towel award people like that dont deserve to win it
412714 however in hindsight i think it might have been better to have told him in front of john macarthur so that dad would just say grace to you
412715 he told me look we wont be remembering this at your thirtieth wedding anniversary
412716 of course i start to breathe after somebody passed gas
412717 jeesh just told a story about being hit on by an old lady
412718 im like a fountain of wit or the fertilizer of said fountain
412719 holy crap we lost 99 48 in the season opener i see they stopped worrying about updating the score list
412720 do you enjoy making people feel retarded you behave like that is your job in life
412721 stephen sounds so smart when hes on the phone what happens when he hangs up
412722 if you were mooned while you were marooned you would be a mooned marooned moon
412723 hey thrower thrower thrower hey thrower thrower thrower huck thrower huck huck thrower huck
412724 well youre her boss and shes your your your whatever
412725 its hard to fill a gas tank on the shoulder of the interstate in 4 inch heels while someone is mocking you with a camera but thats what happens when you dont think the gas gauge really means it yet
412726 its been a while since i took geometry its been even longer since you took geometry
412727 you know what else is strange looking at a total stranger who looks totally familiar then comparing life stories only to realize that you are the only common link it was six degrees of john letoto and it was hilariously awkward i think its fair to say we both blame your camera
412728 ill be away from my desk invoking a john maneuver
412729 there are limits on what i will forge for you mr letoto
412730 the three worst words in the english language as a brother
412731 its her boyfriends car actually im a creep arent i
412732 aaahhh the wisdom five sisters impart i still get my kicks but i dont get kicked
412733 yup i get all dressed up to go to the grocery store or city hall or whatever its kinda funny if id done that during seminary id probably be married to a preacher boy right now whew that was a close call
412734 johns a little coffee press strong and brown here is his handle here is his frown
412735 being older and still single makes you more single more single than say katie mohler

412854 the geisha sleep in certain positions so as not to disturb their elaborate hairdos and thats what i was just doing

412875 this isnt fair prybys only got on your wall of quotes because pretty much anything that proceeds from her mouth is notably retarded
412876 youre just upset because you cant put that on facebook
412877 theres a stomach virus going around and every girl on my hall has been inflicted with the terror
412878 youre like a reality t v show i want to turn the channel and walk away but for some strange reason i cant
412879 i own too many nice ties not to go to the spring banquet
412880 god blessed me with great hair im counting on that to bring me true love
412881 this song was written for my future wife which is none of you
412882 i hope i dont get married til im in grad school so i can pick up undergrad chicks too
412883 i have a new vein on my leg i feel like an old woman one of those blue nasty ones
412884 may it not be said of me methinks she doth protest too much because really im just raising a voice for all of us you choose to mercilessly poke numerous times throughout the day
412885 cause all my good looking genes cant override someone whos ugly
412886 i lost it from all the throwing up i did
412887 you know if you keep breathing like that when i talk to you about girls youre never going to get married
412888 i dont sleep with him any more john hes older than me hes older than you
412889 i cant explain the honor of having two quotes on your profile it gives one the sense that they are going to be somebody wow
412890 can i suck some of your blood so that i can be a pirate
412891 if i was bored and had a lot of spare time i would count how many pictures of lauren duncan i had on my computer
412892 i dont feel comfortable with you saying that and wearing those shorts
412893 hey lance was telling me about this job at the hospital they charge you nine dollars an hour
412894 do you think they slimmed your dad down for that picture
412895 happy hearts and happy faces happy play in grassy places that was how in ancient ages children grew to kings and sages
412896 i am waiting for you vizzini you told me to go back to the beginning so i have this is where i am and this is where ill stay i will not be moved
412897 love is like quicksilver in the hand leave the fingers open and it stays clutch it and it darts away
412898 its not so much that were afraid of change or so in love with the old ways but its that place in between that we fear its like being between trapezes its linus when his blanket is in the dryer theres nothing to hold on to
412899 still waters run deep but for gods sake child cant you at least get rid of the evidence
412900 after spending every waking moment with carol for 72 hours i know in my heart that im prepared to see her face twice maybe even once a week
412901 i know this is a big decision but im ready for it
412902 ive given this a lot of thought and whenever i imagine giving carol the keys to her place back it just feels right
412903 im not sure shell be ready to take the plunge like this
412904 but if i give her plenty of space and lots and lots of time by herself to think it through shell realize that were meant to be together a lot less
412905 it isnt going to be easy but no one wants this more than i do
412906 as you get older you recognize whats really important to you
412907 when i made the decision to get a lot less serious with carol i just felt this sense of peace i can tell by the look in her eyes that loving longing gaze that i must act now before i miss my chance
412908 what happens now will determine the rest of our future together
412909 the last woman i was with ex wife maria heller i let this moment pass me by and ill always regret it
412910 tacopina una bufala di cazzola per costringere menarini ad acquistare tutto il bologna domani lo leggerete sul giornale lindomani tacopina si tira indietro ora su repubblica
412911 dont take this the wrong way im not breaking up with you i just think we need to slow down a bit and get back on track
412912 we would like everybody to be fully reintegrated by september 3
412913 because we understand that there might be some very difficult cases people who do not want to be reintegrated but cannot be repatriated because they come from conflict zones
412914 it is very difficult sometimes to separate what is simply a robbery and what is something specifically motivated by xenophobia
412915 prognosis of recovery from age related medical problems is not good
412916 a wonderful ambassador for her species it is significant that she has survived to 2008 the international year of the polar bear
412917 fait part de son int r t pour le nouveau parti anticapitaliste lanc par olivier besancenot et la ligue communiste r volutionnaire le 28 juin 2008
412918 dont be silly she has all her own ears you tiresomely conventional little man
412919 it felt good to put that footage in front of everybody here were only half way through principal photography so i wanted to make sure we were on the right track
412920 and to get that response really galvanised our efforts made us feel like we were doing the right thing
412921 people have been asking for months about when its going to happen
412922 so as soon as it does go up the fans go nuts for it and they tear apart every little part of it its become a huge phenomenon immediately looking at trailers online
412923 it used to be that a trailer was an advert for the film now its an event in itself and as soon as they go online people are clicking on them and discussing them
412924 we have for many years premiered trailers with broadcast partners it is a great way to promote the fact that a trailer is about to land in cinemas
412925 the immediacy and reach of the internet however enables studios to reach a global audience simultaneously with this message and for it to proliferate further over time
412926 we are using the internet as an increasingly significant broadcast channel
412927 when they go up with a partner site it is very difficult to then control the proliferation
412928 planning in advance how and when it is distributed has to be thought out very clearly and strategically
412929 trailering is probably the most powerful piece of content at a film distribution companies disposal
412930 they have to use it cannily if they have a major high profile movie there is going to be a teaser trailer
412931 further down the line they will tell the story in a pay off trailer they then shorten it to get more exposure in the cinemas and thats called a cross plug trailer
412932 it was being talked about everywhere and it has hardly any dialogue just these beautiful images
412933 lebih penting gue dong ada gue kebersihan terjamin gue berfungsi lu prei
412934 iya nama kalian selalu dikaitkan dengan sebuah kejadian seperti kakakmu si mawar merah itu waktu lahir kebetulan ada bunga mawar berwarna merah tumbuh di depan rumah

412939 free comedy at the free fringe blah blah come and see our show
412940 how can we make people give blood more bearing in mind that only adults can do it i know lets give them childrens toys
412941 we dont know how widespread mortgage fraud is because finding one person leads to another and to another
412942 i have no doubt from all of the information that theres a serious fraud problem in real estate markets in minnesota
412943 and we must address this with enforcement agencies but also with a legislative approach
412944 these are new sophisticated crimes where everyone in the transaction is involved
412945 im trying to make the best of a bad scenario
412946 i made a mistake i bucked up im paying the price i cant be mad or disappointed at anybody but myself
412947 los campeones ol mpicos recibir n m s de 140 000 los medallistas de plata m s de 100 000 y los de bronce m s de 70 000
412948 acting as a proxy for all types of financing of goods that wouldve been bought anyway
412949 minnesotans intuitively know that being near natural areas increases home values
412950 what this study does is put a dollar figure on the importance of natural amenities to home buyers higher home values in turn benefit local units of government
412951 is the benefit and wisdom of investing in our regions natural resources setting aside land for parks improving water quality protecting wetlands and wildlife providing recreational opportunities it all pays off in terms of preservation quality of life and in actual dollars and cents
412952 the economic impact report takes the research and evaluation to the next level
412953 its our hope and goal as we continue this work that we provide residents decision makers local officials developers and others with facts with which to make informed decisions about investment acquisition and preservation of natural areas
412954 no one much cares for the prospect of property tax increases
412955 but when youre talking about the kind of growth that the county and region are going to experience in coming years its a small price to pay to make sure we preserve the qualities that attracted residents here in the first place
412956 une mauvaise herbe est une plante dont on na pas encore trouv les vertus
412957 personally its heartbreaking i love my writers were a family
412958 its really hard to have to deal with where they are and where i am because im kinda caught in the middle
412959 we have to prepare for the worst and the worst is war
412960 the occupants of the elysee the french presidential palace have become the executors of the will of the white house and have adopted a tone that is even harder even more inflammatory and more illogical than that of washington

412964 un rigore non cambier la mia idea su shevchenko o su un altro giocatore perch gli ho dato fiducia e lho lasciato tirare quindi stata una mia scelta ma questo torneo mi serve per preparare lesordio in campionato con il portsmouth e non lo vedo come una possibilit per sheva di giocare la partita
412965 siamo grati ad andriy per tutto quello che ha fatto per il milan ma ormai il passato se supera i suoi problemi che sono principalmente di natura psicologica e legati al fatto che si trasferito in un altro paese potr fare ancora molto per il chelsea
412966 where it featured a love scene on some lighthouse i watched it since a bestfriend forced me so hard to watch this one then
412967 sei que minhas declara es ir o gerar pol mica mas estou aqui para isso mesmo
412968 ik wil dolgraag kinderen maar ik denk dat ik ze adopteer ik denk dat ik de pijn van een bevalling niet aankan om van voor tot achter uit te scheuren zie ik niet zo blinken
412969 ik denk dat het een fantastische omgeving is voor kinderen
412970 ik ben dol op schoenen net als ieder meisje ik heb al kleding tassen horloges en andere modeaccessoires dus het leek me perfect om met schoenen te komen zodat je van top tot teen mij kunt zijn
412971 have i got the right balance between work and family
412972 to see a world in a grain of sand and heaven in a flower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour
412973 where rose the mountains there to him were friends where rolled the ocean thereon was his home where a blue sky and glowing clime extends he had the passion and the power to roam
412974 i wanted to live deep and suck the marrow of life to drive life into a corner and reduce it to then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience
412975 two roads diverged in a wood and i i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference
412976 as you know shia was involved in a traffic collision last sunday
412977 el acuerdo del consejo de ministros sobre la privatizaci n de aena es una medida inconcreta e improvisada
412978 defina cual es su modelo aeroportuario porque la referencia del consejo de ministros denota una medida raqu tica parcial y una demostraci n m s de que el gobierno no sabe adoptar medidas contra la crisis econ mica
412979 no tiene las ideas claras sobre como tienen que funcionar los aeropuertos est permanentemente sometido a la opini n y al criterio de quienes pretenden soluciones insolidarias parciales y territorialmente desequilibradas
412980 el gobierno est m s interesado en medidas de maquillaje que en medidas eficaces y que nos ayuden a salir de la crisis
412981 no sin saber qu va a pasar m s all del prat o barajas
412982 nada de eso es lo que ha aprobado el consejo de ministros
412983 cu l es el modelo aeroportuario del se or rodr guez zapatero
412984 qu pasa con los aeropuertos del resto de espa a y tambi n con el de le n
412985 haber perdido la br jula y estar noqueado con medidas para la galer a como la reducci n de velocidad en las grandes ciudades que es absolutamente ineficaz el regalo de bombillas que no es m s que decorativa y la privatizaci n parcial de los aeropuertos tardaremos mucho tiempo en salir de la crisis
412986 los espa oles se merecen un gobierno que despu s de ha ver mentido sobre la crisis adopte medidas contundentes y eficaces para salir cuanto antes de ella
412987 refiriendose a que consigas y hagas realidad tus sue os de infancia da igual el tiempo que tardes pero lo bueno es que consigas hacerlos y que sientas realizado aunque no sean totalmente lo que deseabas porque quiz s en el camino de conseguirlos se realicen de otra manera o descubras que lo que quer as no era exactamente lo que quer as

412993 i am just confident that everything that national did in that campaign among the campaign team was in keeping with the electoral act
412994 steven joyce has over a number of years played an important role in the rejuvenation of the party this contribution is set to continue in the years ahead
412995 richs argument is ultimately an argument for inequality but with rich in position to decide who gets what or at the least deciding who is a scumbag and who is not to repeat words used for centuries to those who think they can do this rich only god can decide that if there is no god then no one gets to decide
412996 libertarians argue that they have innate rights to participate on a case by case basis but the system is not designed to accommodate that
412997 doves can and do complain using your exact argument structure and assumptions that they vehemently object to a single of their tax dollars used to fund armed forces weapons and related infrastructure all of which by the way is far more expensive than mere education doves do not get to so earmark their taxes nor do you do you wish to allow them to do so
412998 one further argument that libertarians tend to covet has to do with scale and proportion i pay more than you so i am entitled to more than you
412999 that power is the goal of your argument rich and it belongs to no human a persons worth is not based on your particular monetary model such an argument is ultimately an argument for inequality

413007 people say you cant measure the value of a poem but this is just lazy thinking a citation index readily shows that wordsworths daffodils has the edge on herricks to daffodils and it doesnt take a genius to work out that a sonnet or a villanelle is relatively slack work compared to a solid idyll or a fully fledged epic

413024 what helped me get through those lonely days was knowing that god does love me that he does have a plan for me and that his plan is for my good
413025 this is a time to depend upon god like never before place your cares and anxieties on him because he cares for you he knows the struggles youre going through dont lose hope in terms of getting on with your life there is life after this tragedy
413026 therefore brothers we have an obligation but it is not to the sinful nature to live according to it for if you live according to the sinful nature you will die but if by the spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body you will live because those who are led by the spirit of god are sons of god
413027 what was so bad is that i knew what it felt like to be loved to be cherished to not be lonely to have a full life all of a sudden it seemed like my life was over i was convinced that i would never be loved again that i would die alone i dont ever want to feel like that again
413028 at some of those darkest hours i would envision christ on the cross or envision him going through what led up to the cross the pain and suffering he endured when i was able to focus on that it made my problems seem so much smaller at my darkest hours i would concentrate on christ himself that helped me tremendously

413066 our propaganda is one of permeating we urged our members to join the liberal and radical associations in their district or if they preferred it the conservative associations we permeated the party organisations and pulled all the strings we could lay our hands on with the utmost adroitness and energy and we succeeded so well that in 1888 we gained the solid advantage of a progressive majority full of ideas that would never have come into their heads had not the fabians put them there
413067 the necessity and value of delegated legislation and its extension is inevitable if the process of socialisation is not to be wrecked by the normal methods of obstruction which existing parliamentary procedure sanctions
413068 to take vast powers and legislate under them by ordinance and decree
413069 a mass of evidence establishes the fact that there is in existence a persistent and well contrived system intending to produce and in practice producing a despotic power which at one and the same time places government departments beyond the sovereignty of parliament and beyond the jurisdiction of the courts
413070 if you dont like change youd better not become a christian once you belong to jesus change is inevitable our whole christian experience is an experience of change it is an experience of putting off the old and putting on the new it is an experience of no longer being conformed to the pattern of this world but being transformed by the renewing of our minds the whole theological concept of sanctification is rooted in the reality that god changes people repentance is change conversion is change regeneration is change transformation is change and sanctification is change all of the deeply theological constructs that we have embraced and understand to be true cannot exist outside of a theology of change

413075 yahweh says this i offer you three things choose which one of them i am to inflict on you
413076 take your choice between three years of famine or three months of disaster at the hands of your enemies with your enemies sword overtaking you or three days of yahwehs sword an epidemic in the country while the
413077 he also forced everyone small and great rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark which is the name of the beast or the number of his name
413078 a third angel followed them and said in a loud voice if anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand he too will drink of the wine of gods fury which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath
413079 but the beast was captured and with him the false prophet who had performed the miraculous signs on his behalf with these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped his image the two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur
413080 and he performed great and miraculous signs even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast he deceived the inhabitants of the earth he ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived he was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed
413081 the coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles signs and wonders and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing they perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved for this reason god sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness
413082 the temonarius fabius victor is present together with valerianus quintianus the praepositus caesariensis and the fine recruit maximilianus victors son since he is acceptable i ask that he be measured
413083 why do you want to know my name it is not permitted to me to serve in the military since i am a christian
413084 i cannot serve in the military i cannot do wrong i am a christian
413085 i will not do it i cannot serve in the military
413086 i will not serve cut off my head i do not serve the world but i do serve my god
413087 he himself knows he has his purpose what is best for him
413088 i will not accept the seal i already have the seal of my christ
413089 i wish that you would do so that is even my title to glory
413090 i do not accept the worlds seal and if you give it to me i will break it since i value it at nought i am a christian it is not permitted to me to bear the lead upon my neck after having received the saving seal of my lord jesus christ the son of the living god he whom you do not know who suffered for the life of the world whom god surrendered for our sins all of us christians serve him him we follow as the source of life and author of salvation
413091 serve and accept the seal so that you do not suffer a terrible death
413092 i will not die my name is already with my lord i cannot serve in the military
413093 have regard to your youth and serve for this befits a young man
413094 my service is for my lord i cannot serve the world i have already said i am a christian
413095 there are christian soldiers in the sacred retinue of our lords diocletian maximianus constantius and maximus and they serve
413096 they themselves know what is best for them but i am a christian and i cannot do wrong
413097 serve lest having scorned military service you begin upon a terrible death
413098 i will will not die even if i do depart the world my spirit will live with my lord christ
413099 because you have disloyally refused military service you will receive the appropriate sentence in order to serve as an example to others
413100 maximilianus since you have disloyally refused the military oath it has been decided for you to be punished by the sword
413101 dearest brothers with an eager desire hurry with as much courage as you can so that it may befall you to see the lord and that he may reward you also with a similar crown
413102 give that guard the new clothing which you had got ready for me during my military service so that i may welcome you with a hundredfold reward and we may glory with the lord together
413103 what you have seen and heard in your last dreams and what you have wanted to know and shall have revealed to you tomorrow night
413104 leave me alone i am exhausted ive been tormented by a toothache for several day now and need rest besides nightmares have completely worn me out
413105 the way of sinners is made plain with stones and in their end is hell and darkness and pains
413106 the almighty wants you to go he who leads you on will also know how to lead you back
413107 the proud have hidden a net for me and they have stretched out cords for a snare they have laid for me a stumbling block by the wayside
413108 why do so many get caught who pulls them down
413109 because they are dragged by the snare of human respect
413110 my good fellow my legs wont carry me another step i just cant go any farther
413111 if we go any farther how shall we ever get back to the oratory i will never make it up this slope
413112 now that we have come so far do you want me to leave you here
413113 read the inscription on that portal and you will know
413114 depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels
413115 every tree that yielded not good fruit shall be cut down and shall be cast into the the fire
413116 there is no need you have them all in holy scripture you even have some of them inscribed in your porticoes
413117 dont you know how terrible gods vengeance is do you think you can restrain one who is fleeing from his just wrath
413118 because gods wrath will pierce hells gates to reach and torment him even in the midst of fire
413119 if so many of our boys end up this way we are working in vain how can we prevent such tragedies
413120 and that is where they would go if they were to die now
413121 then let me jot down their names so that i may warn them and put them back on the path to heaven
413122 do you really believe that some of them would reform if you were to warn them then and there your warning might impress them but soon they will forget it saying it was just a dream and they will do worse than before others realizing they have been unmasked receive the sacraments but this will be neither spontaneous nor meritorious others will go to confession because of a momentary fear of hell but will still be attached to sin
413123 then is there no way to save these unfortunate lads please tell me what i can do for them
413124 they have superiors let them obey them they have rules let them observe them they have the sacraments let them receive them
413125 youll learn much but first tell me do you wish to go alone or with me
413126 how will i ever be able to find my way out without your help
413127 he will give fire and worms into their flesh and they may burn and may feel forever
413128 the pool of fire where both the beast and the false prophet shall be tormented day and night forever and ever
413129 and the smoke of their torments shall ascend up forever and ever
413130 a land of misery and darkness where the shadow of death and no order but everlasting horror dwelleth
413131 no one may have a helpful companion a comforting friend a loving heart a compassionate glance or a benevolent word all this is gone forever do you just want to see or would you rather experience these things yourself
413132 the nourishment thereof is fire and much wood the breath of the lord as a torrent of brimstone kindling it
413133 in what place soever it shall fall there shall it be
413134 when these boys come dashing into this cave dont they know where they are going
413135 they surely do they have been warned a thousand times but they still choose to rush into the fire because they do not detest sin and are loath to forsake it furthermore they despise and reject gods incessant merciful invitations to do penance thus provoked divine justice harries them hounds them and goads them on so that they cannot halt until the reach this place
413136 oh how miserable these unfortunate boys must feel in knowing they no longer have any hope
413137 if you really want to know their innermost frenzy and fury go a little closer
413138 the wicked shall see and be angry he shall gnash with his teeth and pine away
413139 when they recall the happy lot of their good companions
413140 we wearied ourselves in the way of iniquity and destruction and have walked through hard ways but the way of the lord we have not known what hath pride profited us or what advantage hath the boasting of riches brought us all those things are passed away like a shadow
413141 are all dead to gods grace were they to die now or persist in their evil ways they would be damned but we are wasting time let us go on
413142 their worm shall not die and their fire shall not be quenched
413143 he will give fire and worms into their flesh and they may burn and may feel forever
413144 before going to hell one has to be judged i have not been judged yet and so i will not go to hell
413145 what would you rather do visit hell and save your boys or stay outside and leave them in agony
413146 of course i love my boys and wish to save them all
413147 and see how our good almighty god lovingly provides a thousand means for guiding your boys to penance and saving them from everlasting death
413148 transgressions of this commandment caused the eternal ruin of many boys
413149 they did but they either omitted or insufficiently confessed the sins against the beautiful virtue of purity saying for instance that they had committed such sins two or three times when it was four or five other boys may have fallen into that sin but once in their childhood and through shame never confessed it or did so insufficiently others were not truly sorry or sincere in their resolve to avoid it in the future there were even some who rather than examine their conscience spent their time trying to figure out how best to deceive their confessor anyone dying in this frame of mind chooses to be among the damned and so he is doomed for all eternity only those who die truly repentant shall be eternally happy now do you want to see why our merciful god brought you here
413150 now you will surely let me take down their names so that i may warn them individually
413151 always preach against immodesty a generic warning will suffice bear in mind that even if you did admonish them individually they would promise but not always in earnest for a firm resolution one needs gods grace which will not be denied to your boys if they pray god manifests his power especially by being merciful and forgiving on your part pray and make sacrifices as for the boys let them listen to your admonitions and consult thei conscience it will tell them what to do
413152 they who would become rich full into temptation and and to the snare of the devil
413153 because they are as poor as i am we are not rich and do not want to be we give it no thought
413154 as you see the inscription does apply to your boys
413155 some boys are so attached to material possessions that their love of god is lessened thus they sin against charity piety and meekness even the mere desire of riches can corrupt the heart especially if such a desire leads to injustice your boys are poor but remember that greed and idleness are bad counselors one of your boys committed substantial thefts in his native town and though he could make restitution he gives it not a thought there are others who try to break into the pantry or the prefects or economers office those who rummage in their companions trunks for food money or possessions those who steal stationery and books
413156 some are here for having stolen clothes linen blankets and coats from the oratory wardrobe in order to send them home to their families others for willful serious damage others yet for not having given back what they had borrowed or for having kept sums of money they were supposed to hand over to the superior now that you know who these boys are
413157 admonish them tell them to curb all vain harmful desires to obey gods law and to safeguard their reputation jealously lest greed lead them to greater excesses and plunge them into sorrow death and damnation
413158 recall what you were told when you saw those spoiled grapes on the wine
413159 and yet i have always heard that pride is the root of all evil
413160 it is generally speaking but specifically do you know what led adam and eve to commit the first sin for which they were driven away from their earthly paradise
413161 listen carefuliy the boys you see here are those who prepare such a tragic end for themselves by being disobedient so and so and so and so who you think went to bed leave the dormitory later in the night to roam about the playground and contrary to orders they stray into dangerous areas and up scaffolds endangering even their lives others go to church but ignoring recommendations they misbehave instead of praying they daydream or cause a disturbance there are also those who make themselves comfortable so as to doze off during church services and those who only make believe they are going to church woe to those who neglect prayer he who does not pray dooms himself to perdition some are here because instead of singing hymns or saying the little office of the blessed virgin they read frivolous or worse yet forbidden books
413162 what advice shall i give them to safeguard them from such a tragedy
413163 keep telling them that by obeying god the church their parents and their superiors even in little things they will be saved
413164 warn them against idleness because of idleness david fell into sin tell them to keep busy at all times because the devil will not then have a chance to tempt them
413165 thanks for having been so good to me now please lead me out of here
413166 now that you have seen what others suffer you too must experience a touch of hell
413167 so that you may say you have both seen and touched the walls of eternal suffering and that you may understand what the last wall must be like if the first is so unendurable look at this wall
413168 there are a thousand walls between this and the real fire of hell
413169 a thousand walls encompass it each a thousand measures thick and equally distant from the next one each measure is a thousand miles this wall therefore is millions and millions of miles from hells real fire it is just a remote rim of hell itself
413170 there is no arrangement on this and those stories are not accurate
413171 for all the speculation about whether humphrey the cat former no 10 cat is going to be the next leadership contender and that was taking up acres of pages the no 10 agenda was on the economy
413172 for four days senator john mccain and his allies have accused senator barack obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true
413173 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
413174 unless i am convicted by scripture and plain reason and i do not accept the authority of popes and councils for they have contradicted each other my conscience is held captive to the word of god
413175 para m se convirti en una pesadilla a cualquier bar al que entraba estaba siempre sonando
413176 todo el mundo deber a tener las mismas opciones que cindy yo o el senador obama
413177 mi oponente habla mucho sobre esperanza y cambio y la educaci n es una prueba mejor que ninguna sobre su seriedad si el senador obama contin a sirviendo a los sindicatos de maestros en lugar de comprometerse con una reforma real entonces deber a empezar a buscar nuevos esl ganes
413178 mi inter s es asegurar que tenemos el tipo de pol tica energ tica integral que pueda reducir los precios de la gasolina

413184 the performance was incisive and riveting a testimony to the breadth and depth of these musicians interpretive and technical skills
413185 what a joy it must be for such high powered musicians to collaborate in a fashion that is both liberating and disciplined
413186 it is hard to do less than marvel at 15 performers playing with such precision that at times one has to look to see if more than one person is playing
413187 the reviews of previous concerts have ranged from extremely positive to outright raves the playing was inspired

413297 mobile games are essentially an impulse purchase why shouldnt i be able to go into covent garden tube and buy a game from a bluetooth kiosk for my journey home

413304 tras malgastar m s de un a o en el litigio y perder sus argumentos bmw oracle ha acudido a los tribunales por segunda vez para forzar su estrategia de eliminar a los distintos equipos de la americas cup inscritos como desaf os leg timos
413305 m s competitiva y cercana a los espectadores de la historia a pesar de los intentos no fruct feros durante un a o de limitar la competici n a un duelo entre dos equipos
413306 bmw oracle intenta ahora retrasar y frustrar la marcha de la americas cup presentando una apelaci n fr vola y que se prolongar en el tiempo
413307 bmw oracle no fue capaz de avanzar hasta la ronda final de la americas cup durante la 31 y la 32 edici n ya que fue eliminado en la ronda de regatas eliminatorias de los desaf os en ambas ocasiones
413308 estamos convencidos de que ser n unos grandes juegos para los deportistas espa oles pues el grand simo trabajo efectuado por las federaciones espa olas con el apoyo incondicional del gobierno de espa a ha colocado al deporte espa ol en su m s alta cima
413309 los ltimos 4 a os han sido cuantitativa y cualitativamente los mejores de nuestra historia
413310 con meticulosidad rigor y seriedad y para ello ha sido muy importante la colaboraci n entre los gobiernos de china y espa a los intercambios entre federaciones que permitieron los intercambios entrenamientos y competiciones entre deportistas t cnicos directivos y equipos
413311 compartir experiencias en china con sus mejores deportistas grandes entrenadores y excelentes dirigentes ha favorecido e impulsado a nuestro deporte

413315 las medallas las veo muy dif cil las favoritas son eeuu australia y rusia son tres equipos que est n un pasito por delante del resto no como en el baloncesto masculino que se ha igualado todo bastante aunque siempre puede dar alguien la sorpresa
413316 el equipo ha hecho ltimamente unos torneos muy buenos ganando incluso a rusia en su casa
413317 el segundo el tercero y el cuarto van a estar entre china rep blica checa y nosotras el nivel de los tres es muy parecido por lo que el m s m nimo detalle puede hacer que quedes tanto segunda como cuarta
413318 el ambiente es muy bonito es algo especial todo el rollo que se habla del esp ritu ol mpico es verdad es muy interesante convivir con gente de otros deportes algo que no puedes hacer en otras competiciones
413319 est bien hecho y es bastante t cnico y exigente

413322 estoy entrenando muy bien ahora no me preocupan mis rivales en la competici n yo sigo mis propios pasos sigo mi propio camino

413454 la leggerezza del mio sapermi nulla mi ha fatto giungere fin qui il pugnale feroce ed omicida del dolore mi ha confidato i segreti degli abissi ed il mio coraggio non li ha ripudiati derido me stesso perch vedo altezze inarrivabili e mi abbatto come un angelo apocalittico su coloro che ancora qualcosa si credono perch ho scoperto che nulla di pi basso e falso c dellimpertinenza dello spirito
413455 il vostro chiacchiericcio bulimico offende la musica su cui il mio spirito libra la sua danza il vostro tiepido cuore macchia la mia visione del tutto le vostre inutili occupazioni sono attentati alla mia essenzialit la vostra ossessiva vanit oltraggia il coraggio del mio lungo eremitaggio il vostro ottuso intendere lacera la sensibilit della mia intelligenza lasciate che io dia fuoco alle case e distrugga i villaggi concedetemi di pugnalare ciascuno di voi cos da spurgare le vostre viscere dal cancro che vi corrode un solo fendente vi prego ed io forse potr tornare nella mia solitaria grotta scorgendovi in lontananza volare vicino alle aquile

413457 nessun diritto posso vantare su voi ed i vostri villaggi ma mio dovere quello di avvertirvi chi io sia e quali i miei propositi poich un buon maestro mette in guardia i suoi discepoli contro se stesso la vostra malizia ha stancato la terra e nessuna perdita potete concepire per farvi fratelli del vento io canto il fuoco e lacciaio e voi rispondete con olezzi da latrina putrida e ruggini cancerose che io potr mai avere da spartire con voi dove sono le lingue di fulmine che io invoco per punirvi dove labisso in cui io chiedo siate precipitati per la vostra indolenza dove fuggito il tuono che fino ad oggi ha istruito la mia voce

413467 im an active guy so id was relieved to hear i could keep most of my own joint rather than have it replaced
413468 as i looked deeper and deeper i discovered that hip resurfacing is a procedure approved by the fda only a year ago so it was impossible to find a doctor in the u s with a substantial track record
413469 my wife and i were more comfortable with going to belgium
413470 everything was flawless the hospital was incredible state of the art i felt like i was in the space shuttle everyone spoke three languages and english was never a problem
413471 i knew before i left home that dr de smet was highly skilled but i was amazed one day to see a u s doctor visiting him for training a fellow patient told me he was the best in the world and i believe him
413472 one of my fellow patients was belgian and he invited us for an incredible spread at his home one night
413473 id been in too much pain to keep the business at full throttle which took a big toll on our familys finances
413474 now i can get back to full swing and i want wouter to come to new orleans for dinner to celebrate
413475 medical tourism hip resurfacing in belgium for new orleans resident through worldmedassist
413476 having this surgery in the u s would have wiped me out
413477 having someone help me get the transplant i needed in india with top notch doctors in a great hospital at a fraction of the cost saved me so much money that i flew my girlfriend and husband to india to help us recuperate and still saved 275 000 the surgery has given me back a life i thought was lost
413478 in early june i hit the internet and eventually landed on the term medical tourism i searched several firms saying i need a liver transplant several responded but i kept coming back to worldmed assist
413479 by late june they had me on my way to india and my surgery was finished on july 11 pretty amazing i heard i was the first american to have a liver transplant in india
413480 i was initially reluctant to take kevin on as a patient
413481 live liver transplants are extremely risky no matter where in the world theyre done but i knew of doctor subhash gupta at one of worldmed assists contracted hospitals apollo in delhi india we did our research and gathered references dr gupta has done 120 live liver transplants with a long term survival record that surpassed the mayo clinics the u s s gold standard for liver transplants
413482 when he asked his sister jo ann if she would be his liver donor she didnt think twice
413483 when i decided to go with worldmed assist first i was impressed there was no waiting time and they work with well established accredited hospitals and doctors
413484 when my medical cost came in at a seventh of what i would pay in the u s my choice was clear
413485 the long waiting time in the u s is because most liver transplants come from deceased people so the organs are scarce
413486 if you are seriously ill and uninsured youve got to find first class medical care at a price that wont kill you
413487 im glad companies like worldmed assist can help people like me find great hospitals and great doctors in other parts of the world

413611 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
413612 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
413613 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
413614 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
413615 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
413616 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media

413625 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
413626 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
413627 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

413635 the solution is to remove the effects of stress on a regular basis which can be done through tai chi and qigong

413641 weve lost huge chunks of our trails there were established foot trails that are completely gone now
413642 were getting more rain were getting earlier ice melting and later freeze ups
413643 this is not my preferred way to roll out anything
413644 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which were not only not hiding but were scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy

413649 we were surprised by earnings in india the huge demand for human capital and people with experience in management financial services and the it information technology sector means that expats have been able to demand increasingly higher salaries
413650 as the world becomes increasingly globalized companies want their managers to get a diversity of experience across the world while employees want an opportunity to experience a lifestyle and culture different from their own

413922 im coming as the president of a friend and im coming as a sportsman bush said in an interview this week with fuqing yang of cctv
413923 im going to go to the u s chinese basketball game i understand yao ming is back on the court and it will be an interesting challenge for the u s team
413924 pressure from politicians here in washington calling on him not to go to beijing
413925 well first of all im under pressure from politicians on a lot of fronts bush said
413926 i mean this isnt the only issue that i get pressured on and presidents need to make their decision based upon whats best not whats political
413927 and i think its best for u s chinas relations that i go i know its important for me to send a clear signal to the chinese people that we respect them i tell people that of course weve got differences with china on issues theyve got differences with us on issues
413928 but the best way to conduct our diplomacy and conduct our relations is out of mutual respect bush said
413929 and its much more likely a chinese leader will listen to my concerns if he knows i respect the people of china do we agree on everything of course not but do we agree to have good cordial relations and work hard to make our relationship unique and strong absolutely
413930 i explored around beijing on a bicycle it was a interesting time totally different city then than it is today
413931 i can remember going to a department store and nobody had seen a westerner and they were amazed when i would go and i would go with my mother and my sister and they were amazed it was like we were like from a different planet
413932 first of all theres very colorful and obviously theres a lot of automobiles it seems like more automobiles than bicycles and people are used to a relationship between the west and china its a common occurrence theres a lot of exchanges
413933 im going as the president who happens to be a sports fan bush said
413934 look theres a couple of signals and its very important to understand he said
413935 one is i dont think the olympics should be politicized i mean it is a sporting event of the greatest caliber
413936 secondly i am going out of respect for the people of china this is a big deal for the chinese people and thats why im going thirdly i will have and always have had very frank and candid discussions with the chinese government on a variety of issues

413963 you should be on the beach you need a break
413964 youve got to refresh yourself i am going to take a week in august but i agree with you that somebody somebody who had worked in the white house who not clinton himself but somebody who had been close to the process said that should we be successful that actually the most important thing you need to do is to have big chunks of time during the day when all youre doing is thinking and the biggest mistake that a lot of these folks make is just feeling as if you have to be
413965 right in 15 minute increments and well and you start making mistakes or you lose the big picture
413966 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why
413967 i think his mind is visceral driven less by thought and more by feelings this doesnt mean hes totally reactive or without logic or thought processes it just means hes a fighter pilot he reacts to circumstances

413970 two days ago she said what does the letter say
413971 im sorry maam i cant reveal that it may be required as evidence
413972 evidence of what arent you going to start a search for her body and arrest that goddamned jerk who killed her
413973 i understand your concerns maam but well you see maam a lot of people disappear every day and most of em dont want to get found we dont issue a missing person report for at least a week and this letter seems to indicate that such action might be inappropriate anyway
413974 how can you say that she was my best friend and we were very close now shes dead and you need to stop her murderer
413975 like i said i understand your feelings maam but i have to follow procedures and i think youll see that in the end its for the best what i suggest is that you try to be patient and let us take care of things in the meantime ill need to get some details from you
413976 yes i was but i knew he wouldnt spend the money locally or put it in a bank so i thought the risk was worth it in any case the only thing more he could do to me was kill me so i didnt care
413977 but what did you write in the letter the police wouldnt tell me
413978 i told them the whole story of what i knew including where he planned to go and told them to search his car i cant wait for them to catch him and i wont feel safe til they do
413979 ill wait a while and then go down to mexico i think probably open a little bar in some tourist place you want to come maybe rick will join me when he graduates

414000 its on a fast pace right now but they have a lot of work to do
414001 i was at the county fair and met quite a few landowners
414002 i had a good response from them and local residents
414003 survey work is underway weve taken soil borings and have equipment in place to monitor the water table
414004 were also doing bird and bat studies as well as signing up landowners
414005 its all flat out that way and there are no towns within any of the total project
414006 having the ordinance in place will really be a help
414007 the guy at the counter couldnt figure out how to do anything with it but he did try and activate it and apparently it worked he told me that it did activate and we have that sim card back in my wifes phone well needless to say we didnt take it we spent an hour and a half in the store trying to figure it out and he was on the phone with apple finally we decided that we didnt want it there were some other things that were wrong with it too

414009 they need to know that wind turbines are not efficient theyll create havoc with our environment will have a severe and long lasting impact on our economy and will put our property values and health at risk
414010 people are totally unaware of the downside that there are no benefits at all to these turbines except for the people who have land leases to host them and the power companies who own them
414011 were taking the time to verify every fact we can
414012 is this going to be the smart way to go when the leases are up in 20 years we dont know
414013 you cannot get the sense of scope of this until you see it in person
414014 there are people who have learned lessons here with knowledge we could benefit from
414015 were doing the best we can with the tools were given

414017 in which the two groups have become polarized about wind turbines
414018 beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the two groups never will meet on this
414019 there have been questions forwarded to us whether the province has a proper environmental assessment process in place to address this sort of development
414020 it is there and it will play a role but we cant solve our energy problems with wind power alone
414021 at the end of the day it will be up to the municipal councils whether they allow wind turbines within their municipalities

414096 quebecers are currently going through a period of questioning the essence of their collective identity and increasing immigration levels would not be easily accepted without a minimal preliminary consensus on what constitutes the common values of quebec society
414097 ensure the survival of french as the language of daily use and to plan immigration in light of that consideration
414098 the retention of previous immigration waves and the successful integration of newcomers constitute the principal issues to take into account before considering an increase in immigration levels
414099 for quebec that its legislature even entertained bill 195 and that the pq should admit it made

414108 our conference features experts who researched the dangers that fluoride poses to human health our keynote speaker dr a k susheela executive director fluorosis research and rural development foundation india probably knows more about fluorides toxic effects to the body than any other living scientist it is important that officials who promote water fluoridation hear what she and others have to say
414109 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether toronto should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health
414110 the best way that the oda can get communities and politicians to stand up for water fluoridation is to provide in person a cogent and scientifically referenced defense of fluoridation at the afternoon forum
414111 the best way to lower childrens fluoride intake as health canada suggests is to stop fluoridation

414122 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
414123 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
414124 affirmed that iran as a state party to the npt nuclear non proliferation treaty has the right to have its fuel cycle program for peaceful purposes
414125 the ministers are of the view that sanctions imposed on iran for its nuclear program are of political nature and should be promptly removed
414126 they further affirm that with increased cooperation of iran with the agency to resolve all remaining issues about its past and present nuclear activities the issue of iranian nuclear program should be solely dealt with within the agency framework and there is no legal basis that the un security council proceeds in this regard
414127 the un security council has been clear on irans obligations the iaea has been clear that iran has not been transparent
414128 and now they cant even get their friends from the nam to come out in support of their interpretation of their program it actually reinforces just how isolated they are
414129 its a bonus for anyone like me who didnt know what to do with coins and didnt throw them away
414130 everyone is totally confused maybe things will settle down in a few days its farcical at the moment
414131 a member of the hamas police and a member of the ezzedine al qassam brigades the military wing of hamas were martyred
414132 fired mortar rounds at the hamas police as well as a rocket at gaza city
414133 there have been several arrests and there will be many more we have asked the police to be firm
414134 these are lies we never fired rockets or mortar rounds hamas is the one committing crimes we have asked all the palestinian factions islamists and nationalists to use their influence so that these crimes cease
414135 laid siege to our house firing mortar rounds targeting our women and our children

414141 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
414142 i learned about u s patent 5 003 186 titled stratospheric welsbach seeding for reduction of global warming
414143 it turned out that it seemed to work and so thats why we had applied for a patent
414144 for instance we were using it to develop targets for laser range finders
414145 we are committed to a billion dollar program to develop and deploy advanced technologies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions
414146 i suspect it may be some sort of weather control
414147 the beginning of the story concerns my search for answers for my sons illness it was in january of 1998 when i met a woman a friend of mine introduced me to her through the huntsville item newspaper articles from 1994 it seemed that there was a huntsville mystery illness in our area
414148 now i know why we have so many rare illnesses in this area
414149 to my mind there is no more serious crime than an official military cover up of facts that could prevent more effective diagnosis and treatment of sick u s veterans it is an astonishing example of the lengths to which the u s department of defense is going to deny reality these are horrendous statistics that show the time scale of the problem and the heartlessness and irresponsibility of a military bureaucracy that gives every sign of wanting to protect itself more than the health and well being of our servicemen and women who actually go and fight our wars
414150 the use of human subjects will be allowed for the testing of chemical and biological agents by the u s department of defense accounting to congressional committees with respect to the experiments and studies
414151 the secretary of defense may conduct tests and experiments involving the use of chemical and biological warfare agents on civilian populations within the united states
414152 the question of power has been settled by the elections
414153 it should be stressed that executive power will remain with the elected president
414154 the iraqi government is refusing any individual step to change the situation in kirkuk and it is considering it illegal and unconstitutional
414155 one should not focus on the deadline too much what matters is that we get a clear answer quickly its not a matter of one day
414156 the problem seems to be growing faster than they can handle
414157 it is very clear that the bush administration wants to work with the democratic government and congress is very welcoming
414158 at the same time not everyone in washington fully understands that there has been a major change in pakistan and the new government has inherited several issues from the previous regime
414159 the military is just waiting around giving the civilian government enough rope to hang itself
414160 the u s wants to strengthen the government but knows full well that its going to be the military that will have to confront the militants
414161 its one thing to bomb a country that we dont need
414162 but if were going to keep bombing pakistan we need a wider strategy
414163 the isi has always been somewhat of a problem but now without a powerful president individuals already inclined to cause trouble now have freer rein to do it
414164 re assert his authority and help his party out of the hole they have managed to dig themselves into
414165 we have got to get away from behind the scenes plotting
414166 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has

414183 we are nearing the end of american identity politics as we know it bearing that gift to those who prize the individual over the tribal is a messenger who shared a hyde park neighborhood with milton friedman though with a public record that suggests he is more statist than classical liberal but sen barack obama d ill cant be categorized that simply he is rather an intellectual and ideological work in progress not stuck in cable babble caricatured time he may be traveling the circuitous path many liberal tarians or libertarian democrats like me treaded as we grew and found our way back to the self reliant values that informed our pluralistic democracy we lost those values in the industrial and progressive eras when advocates of centralized planning prized societys perfection over individual liberty while obamas positions dont exactly channel the cato institute his departure from usual democratic party left liberalism is reflected in the lefts suspicion of him for not having all the 162 point plans of sen hillary clinton or spewing the syrupy populism of trial lawyer to the underclass sen john edwards to me this suggests the beginnings of a journey away from the great society mind set of the democratic party but perhaps most important to libertarians his election will put the jesse jacksons the al sharptons and the white identity politics liberals out of business no longer will they be able to peddle victimology or mau mau their way through the political landscape demanding diversity training minority contracts or other tribal reparations from bigots they find behind every bush the myth of unassimilable minorities dies when a majority white nation selects a leader of color just as religious social distance was diminished when a majority protestant country chose a catholic a half century before there is no perfect leader in the wings ill settle for one whose election will signal the end of the world of racial politics as we know it

414346 the primary years are an academic apprenticeship not only in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy but also bodily skills of application to work and independence in learning its not about turning kids into homework robots but teaching them to apply themselves to their work
414347 there has been inadequate attention given to the ways educational attainment is founded on embodied capacities such as productive stillness and quiet which are crucial to sustained attention and application in intellectual endeavour
414348 i often have to start the year teaching the kids work habits the capability to sit down and focus
414349 some children struggle to control themselves they dont have any self discipline you get children who come into the classroom and start walking around the room in the middle of a task

414366 this is not my preferred way to roll out anything
414367 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which were not only not hiding but were scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy

414380 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened my relationship with my protection team was always cordial certainly entirely professional this kind of absurd behaviour never occurred
414381 i never heard myself called by the name scruffy in nine years
414382 i tried to tell him that having us around hadnt put scruffy off his stroke in the past
414383 i dont even want to justify that with a response the police always had enormous respect for my privacy they understood it was very difficult for me to live in a house with four strangers it is an obscenity to suggest that i asked people to leave the room so that i could have sex with my girlfriend i will not have that said about me

414397 we are very very well into the project of next years car we started a long time ago
414398 it is a very difficult situation but not just for us specifically but also for all our main competitors
414399 we have to push hard for this years championship and we have to push hard for next years car we have got only one team so we need a very very careful management of the resources of the priority and we need to find the optimum balance between these two activities as we dont want to invest everything this year and then have a lack of performance next year we want to be strong this year and strong next year so thats very tricky
414400 currently we are in second position in the world championship and we dont want to give it up so we have to put extra effort into the development
414401 he was someone everybody knew and it has greatly affected everyone we have been taking care of his family at this very difficult time

414404 if any evidence were to be presented against any individual in pakistan or against the interest of pakistans neighbors then the government would certainly act on that evidence
414405 several outstanding problems in the relationship between the united states and pakistan that the elected government inherited from the past are currently being resolved
414406 these include issues of trust between our two intelligence services
414407 if you ask me to describe the state of the dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years
414408 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate and which quite frankly have affected the future of the dialogue
414409 if you have this fluid situation you have elements within the army within the isi who have the opportunity to move forward with their own agenda with respect to afghanistan and india
414410 there is no direction this is what has opened up the door to these elements

414414 the mps metropolitan police service will be sending a team of officers to antigua today
414415 the team which will include one officer from south wales police will support the local senior investigating officers and have been sent following a request from the antiguan authorities received through the foreign and commonwealth office
414416 he put his life on the line for other people all through his career
414417 was i disappointed by his attitude not at all i found him to be very serious and focused
414418 he stayed for his father who he is extremely close to and for his whole environment therefore he was unable to create that split that they expected and we were hoping for
414419 inter coach jose mourinho did hope for this move but we knew it was going to be difficult
414420 so instead we thought of a player who in terms of age and wages is a good deal i am happy that sulley ali muntari has arrived
414421 if id have asked he would have given him to me
414422 he would be great in italy because he is always interested in different types of football
414423 he loves knowing about football and thats why he wouldnt have much of a problem adapting
414424 people always imagine me with perfect hair but thats not who i am the first time he saw me in the country my husband found me in wellies covered in mud
414425 there are british passport holders who live in the uk who are being found in places like kandahar

414427 the most challenging mission i have done in my career
414428 it is an exciting signing everyone is talking about him
414429 hes a talented kid hes a skilful player im sure hell excite the fans
414430 getting him here excites me and shows the kind of football im looking to play at blackburn
414431 well see how it goes it is always hard when you come to a new country i went to italy and it took me a few months to settle down so i dont want too much expectation on the lad it will take him time to settle in but we believe we have a decent player

414450 we learned from last week it was a learning experience for us all particularly for the coaches
414451 we changed our pattern and our kicking game paid dividends we took our opportunities this week and that last bonus point try was just the icing on the cake
414452 it was a pretty good performance from the all blacks
414453 they built pressure and they profited from that and didnt allow us to build pressure and they grew in confidence
414454 we came up a distant second here and we have some downtime before we go to africa and look forward to that opportunity
414455 i cant say 100 percent that we didnt have a letdown but you definitely have to give that kid credit
414456 it would be a shame not to give him the credit that he deserves
414457 we hit into too many double plays to start with
414458 we had what 4 they get you out of a lot of innings quick give their pitcher credit too he pitched well
414459 we play a lot of day games and its hot
414460 hes going to go out and pitch 3 innings somewhere the next few days
414461 the try was just through effort we play for the full 80 minutes and we make it pretty hard for everyone
414462 the first field goal was pretty ugly the second one was nice
414463 its funny i practiced a few yesterday so i must have had a feeling it was going to be a close game
414464 theyre tough to lose those ones im sure nathan and the boys will be very disappointed
414465 weve had our fair share of experiences in those situations and i really credit my blokes today for their determination and courage
414466 at 12 0 we didnt panic and the result was a very handy result for us
414467 there was some young players that came up with some errors that were crucial and hopefully they learn from them
414468 its sad that you put so much effort in and you dont actually take anything away from it
414469 a member of the hamas police and a member of the ezzedine al qassam brigades the military wing of hamas were martyred
414470 fired mortar rounds at the hamas police as well as a rocket at gaza city
414471 there have been several arrests and there will be many more we have asked the police to be firm

414486 we are very pleased to have come to this agreement with omron corporation we believe the company will benefit enormously from the global reach and substantial capital and technology resources that omron brings to sti our customers will benefit from having the best most technologically advanced suite of industrial safety and factory automation products from which to choose
414487 in addition omrons global presence will better enable the company to bring its products to customers on a worldwide basis furthermore this is clearly a win win transaction as stis leadership position in the safety market and our extensive regional sales and distribution channels in north america will further enhance omrons reach within this important market we believe this transaction enhances the ability of the company to live up to its motto of making people safe and productive on a global basis
414488 together omron and sti will create a global safety equipment supplier of safety sensing and control technologies that satisfies customers demands for not just labor productivity but also product quality employee safety and environmental friendliness by acquiring the safety products group of sti we will be able to offer a wider range of cutting edge safety products and consultancy services to our customers
414489 from our modest beginnings sti has grown to become the leading provider of safety automation products and services in north america we are very proud of our accomplishments but realize that as our markets become more global sti would be able to achieve greater success if it could become part of a larger global automation supplier organization omron is that organization
414490 in addition it has become increasingly more expensive to remain a small public company particularly with the high costs associated with the regulatory environment post sarbanes oxley for example we estimate that it costs us more than 1 million dollars a year just to be a public company money that we cannot use for other purposes such as investing in new products and services and growing our company
414491 accordingly when we received a proposal from a large strategic buyer last fall we engaged financial and legal advisors to analyze our strategic alternatives with a goal to maximize value for all shareholders we are pleased that this competitive process resulted in a value that we estimate will provide shareholders a 40 premium over the stock price as of the end of march and a 30 premium over the average closing stock price over the past 30 trading days

414695 waar is de politicus die zegt en z gaan we het doen
414696 dat is tenslotte je plicht maar ze binden dat niet aan de hoopvolle verwachting dat alle problemen spoedig worden opgelost ze brengen hun stem uit zeggen wat ze van bepaalde ontwikkelingen vinden en moeten daarna snel verder met al hun drukke bezigheden

414709 ambtenaren en politici roepen altijd om het hardst dat ego sme slecht is en dat de sterkste schouders de zwaarste lasten moeten dragen maar zij l ven van belastinggeld wat krijgen we daar voor terug wegen vol files slechte scholen wachtlijsten in de gezondheidszorg en een politie die geen inbreker kan vinden als je niet zelf zijn naam en adres kan overhandigen

414943 to use the google search engine to obtain information on the in strategic management techniques can be viewed as bottom up top down or collaborative processes

414956 if you could look at the law which you cant because i wont show it to you you would see that i have made it legal and i dont care
414957 early on it was a bit of a challenge to get linux natively installed on the ps3
414958 denial of human freedom and dignity a denial of happiness and barrier against hope
414959 take a good look around and if youre looking down put a little love in your heart
414960 im good at being uncomfortable so i cant stop changing all the time
414961 hes no good at being uncomfortable so he cant stop staying exactly the same
414962 transformation contains both change and stability plurality and unity movement and constancy it has the nature of life namely to connect organically the polar opposites the stumbling blocks of logic and to unite them in an all embracing rhythm
414963 the destruction of the entrance deprived those inside the tunnel of oxygen
414964 you know not ravolous but its truer to say symptomatic in a demonstration is it not
414965 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
414966 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
414967 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
414968 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
414969 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
414970 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
414971 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
414972 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
414973 the democratic party would be unwise to underestimate the numbers passion and commitment of these voters
414974 rarely do i see an office that knows how to handle an emergency well
414975 one question you should ask is whats the first thing the staff will do if you get into trouble with the sedation
414976 the correct answer is call 911 if they cant answer that you should not proceed
414977 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
414978 it will depend on the business arrangements that are in place
414979 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
414980 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
414981 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
414982 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
414983 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
414984 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
414985 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
414986 the content is less interesting than the cognitive work the show elicits from your mind
414987 aber das erste tor der bundesliga hat nur einer geschossen
414988 ich habe vorher und nachher weit sch nere treffer erzielt aber keine anderer war so wertvoll
414989 ich war auf dem p tt wo hart malocht werden musste auch wenn ich mich manchmal wie ein sklave gef hlt habe hat es mir geholfen
414990 i saw an opportunity to better my life and better my future in sporting achievements and in my career
414991 ive set myself up for the next couple of decades financially and at least i have a stable base to work from
414992 we have a group game on 13 august against great britain and ill be playing against some old friends
414993 but youve got to beat everybody on the path to winning the gold
414994 i had played for scotland since i was 15 and gone through the junior ranks eventually making the senior squad
414995 when i did decide to change nationality and play for holland i had a three year period when i wasnt eligible to play any international hockey
414996 to play for the national team in holland is not really a financial benefit but it definitely is at club level playing out there has allowed me to live the life that i am living right now
414997 ive no regrets none at all there were a few things said when i started such as turncoat and what have you
414998 then people realised why i was doing it and ive received a lot of support in the end
414999 ive achieved my goal of getting into a national team and im now here at the olympics and trying to win a gold medal
415000 we played a friendly game against china and it was 47 degrees
415001 es hat absolut keinen deal gegeben keine vereinbarung mit den chinesen
415002 wir begr en den fortschritt an transparenz und k nnen die verantwortlichen nur ermutigen diesen weg weiter fortzusetzen
415003 china erlaubt mehr als es zugesagt hat es erm glicht auch den freien zugang zu themen die nichts mit olympia zu tun haben
415004 aber mit der aufhebung ist noch nicht der standard von internationaler meinungsfreiheit erreicht
415005 der vorgang zeigt dass die chinesische regierung nicht vollkommen unempfindlich auf druck reagiert
415006 ich verstehe nicht warum die chinesische regierung mit der begrenzung des internet zugangs erneut weltweite skepsis geweckt hat
415007 erst recht nicht in einem so komplexen land wie china
415008 die chinesen scheinen einzusehen dass freiheit und menschenrechte die beste basis f r eine gute zukunft sind
415009 its fine and that they dont guarantee any of the stickers stay on items
415010 nove entre dez id ias geniais do paulo d o errado
415011 ela contou o que me parece um case eloq ente que a hist ria de mandar envelopar os nibus de paris com a capa de veronika decide morrer de todos os livros dele veronika
415012 sem nenhuma d vida a grande maga da carreira do paulo a m nica n o por acaso ela com aquele ar angelical conhecida no mundo editorial como a bruxa de barcelona
415013 tem uma foto minha dan ando com a natalie portman voc pode achar isso a facilmente em arquivo
415014 mas acho que um time que trabalha junto o paulo e a m nica s o muito complementares ele d muitas id ias
415015 nunca assinei na minha vida um contrato de um livro que eu j n o tivesse escrito
415016 claro que o sonho dos editores assinar os pr ximos tr s ou quatro livros mas o que faz o nosso poder de negocia o na sa da no lan amento de um livro ser muito grande que nunca h a garantia do pr ximo
415017 ela acha que eu sou uma nulidade e eu estou convencido de que sim
415018 ela fez as editoras publicarem a vers o comemorativa do 20 anivers rio acompanhada de uma exposi o itinerante das capas em todas as l nguas
415019 a m nica disse a gente vai vender mais 2 000 mil livros acho que ela tem raz o mas uma coisa que eu estou a fim de fazer como a pirataria de meus livros que eu estimulei eu tenho essas boas id ias mas muito mais derivadas do prazer do que do marketing
415020 um caminho interessante e o paulo tem um interesse genu no

415065 v r ambition r att spela t vlingen veckan innan swedish open vi skapar d rmed grunden f r ett av de st rsta tennisarrangemangen i europa efter wimbledon och franska m sterskapen
415066 the reason has to be because we have to repeat everything to men the husband then turned to his wife and asked
415067 i dont know how you can be so stupid and so beautiful all at the same time
415068 you should do it because you get up first and then we dont have to wait as long to get our coffee
415069 you are in charge of cooking around here and you should do it because that is your job and i can just wait for my coffee
415070 no you should do it and besides it is in the bible that the man should do the coffee
415071 how dare you make fun of a vietnam veteran and get a hair cut young man
415072 the brrs bruces rave and rant of the world are the cause of the poor education our children receive in maths and the numerical sciences at least
415073 meaningless sites like bwuces rave and five pubes is a waste of time
415074 i am completely uneducated not going to university did give me an incredible driving force because it leaves you with a slight chip on your shoulder
415075 it makes me feel i am going to read absolutely everything so i can prove that i am not stupid
415076 i cant quite handle the idea of screen actress in big west end hit and all that i would prefer to do something smaller
415077 everything scares me the idea of doing theater scares me in an exciting way but doing any part always terrifies me it boils down to a fear of standing there in a wig and a dress and suddenly thinking i feel like an idiot you must not let your imagination see the absurdity of it and cause your performance to die
415078 we hope you are as pleased as we are that he has tapped senator clinton to deliver one of the most important messages of that crucial week the very role that barack obama had four years ago
415079 regretfully this means that senator hillary clinton is no longer under consideration as senator obamas running mate
415080 it was said as though it was a done deal
415081 the selection of either one of those instead of sen clinton i would find completely incomprehensible
415082 if anyone thinks that picking a woman will simply placate hillary clintons female supporters i think thats very patronizing to women and i dont think that that either gov sebelius or sen mccaskill would disagree
415083 therefore why would he pick two females both who are very admirable public servants why would you pick them over her
415084 i am confident i will get her votes if im the nominee its not clear she would get the votes i got if she were the nominee
415085 there were so many examples in the media of sexist commentary
415086 where we never heard from the party leadership or barack obama
415087 some clinton supporters have complained of jibes against the new york senator by tv talk show hosts off color novelty items that surfaced during the campaign and incidents such as one where hecklers yelled iron my shirt

415192 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
415193 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
415194 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
415195 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
415196 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
415197 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
415198 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

415212 maar club is nog niet klaar voor het grote werk
415213 we hebben vier zware trainingsweken achter de rug fysiek en conditioneel is er geen probleem
415214 dat is pure luxe maar op het vlak van voetbalkwaliteit en automatismen blijft nog een lange weg te gaan
415215 de wedstrijd tegen rijsel is wel pure voorbereiding het enige doel is club scherp aan de start van de competitie brengen de brugse metten gaan enkel om de eer
415216 zeker met die vier dalers ik heb ook de indruk dat meer trainers durven zeggen waar ze voor gaan vroeger was ik de enige
415217 toen hadden we te veel spelers met gelijkaardige kwaliteiten en gebreken
415218 de meeste spelers beseffen dat het dit seizoen beter moet wie zich niet helemaal geeft zal merken dat er iemand anders klaarstaat
415219 de vertrekkers zijn geen slechte voetballers maar nu is onze kern meer heterogeen van kwaliteit en dus beter
415220 we hebben meer mensen die attractiever zijn de vraag is nu of je dat kan omzetten in rendement

415228 we must have stronger negotiations with the imf to prevent it from dictating us like in the past

415237 the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford
415238 no ones changed we all look the same i just want to say break a leg have a good shoot do your best work and heres looking at you kids
415239 its a very bizarre costume when you think about it
415240 its this guy sporting a whip whos off usually for someplace really hot in his leather jacket
415241 theres something about the character that i guess is a good fit for me because the minute i put the costume on i recognize the tone that we need and i feel confident and clear about the character
415242 i was blown away by his short film and francis coppola introduced us
415243 i told him that i wanted to for the second time approach film producer cubby broccoli who had turned me down the first time to see if he would change his mind and hire me to do a james bond movie
415244 and george said ive got something better than that its called raiders of the lost ark he pitched me the story and i committed on the beach
415245 i have a tendency when im working on one thing to doodle around and work on other things to avoid what im doing
415246 and there was no studio that would go near it the army wouldnt cooperate at all it was kind of a hopeless exercise
415247 im in my second cut which means ive put the movie together and ive seen it
415248 i usually do about five cuts as a director the best news is that when i saw the movie myself the first time there was nothing i wanted to go back and shoot nothing i wanted to reshoot and nothing i wanted to add
415249 because i didnt want janusz to modernize and bring us into the 21st century i still wanted the film to have a lighting style not dissimilar to the work doug slocombe had achieved which meant that both janusz and i had to swallow our pride janusz had to approximate another cinematographers look and i had to approximate this younger directors look that i thought i had moved away from after almost two decades
415250 i go for geography i want the audience to know not only which side the good guys on and the bad guys on but which side of the screen theyre in and i want the audience to be able to edit as quickly as they want in a shot that i am loath to cut away from and thats been my style with all four of these indiana jones pictures quick cutting is very effective in some movies like the bourne pictures but you sacrifice geography when you go for quick cutting which is fine because audiences get a huge adrenaline rush from a cut every second and a half on the bourne ultimatum and theres just enough geography for the audience never to be lost especially in the last bourne film which i thought was the best of the three but by the same token indy is a little more old fashioned than the modern day action adventure
415251 if you build a fast engine you dont need fast cutting because the storys being told fluidly and the pages are just turning very quickly you first of all need a script thats written in the express lane and if its not theres nothing you can do in the editing room to make it move faster you need room for character you need room for relationships for personal conflict you need room for comedy but that all has to happen on a moving sidewalk
415252 and we both look a bit older i think certainly but at the same time harrison needed to recapture the caustic laconic spirit of dr jones and certainly he was going to have to manage the action and he did both of those things amazingly well certainly far beyond what i expected
415253 in the first one i tore the a c l in my left leg
415254 and then in the second one i ended up with a bad back injury and had to have surgery in the middle of filming but in this one i was pretty much uninjured
415255 i always wanted to make sure the audience understood the pain
415256 so that they could participate and enjoy the triumph that was always a very big part of my ambition for the character to allow the audience to see his fear allow the audience to have a chance to see him work his way through the problem not to be one of those characters that you know is going to succeed i guess you know that indiana jones is finally going to succeed but i think you dont know how many bumps hes going to take before it happens
415257 clark gable played that role forever the same role which is the freelance cynic who eventually comes around whether hes a newspaper reporter or a pirate humphrey bogart would play it with a little bit more of an edge harrison plays that part really well and can play it with a certain amount of humor which makes it really charming and the idea originally for both han solo and indiana jones is hes in over his head all the time and kind of treading water in solo hes got a lot more bravado and hes actually better at what he does he can actually handle it indiana jones gets in over his head and he cant handle it its only by sheer last second skill or luck or whatever that he actually gets himself out of it you cant create a character like that without knowing that someone like harrison can have the right befuddled look and youre right there with him hes everyman hes us thats exactly what i would look like if i were in that situation and its an honest look its not contrived a lot of those guys now try to copy that the better looking movie star types who try to do it in the end harrison is a movie star because hes a character actor he is like clark gable who was also a character actor and humphrey bogart who was a character actor those people were not adonis superhero guys but thats why theyre so endearing thats why everybody loves them thats why theyre so much fun to watch on screen because theyre vulnerable
415258 i would put that on the credible side because hes trained in martial arts and all that kind of stuff and we know that people in martial arts even little old ladies can break somebodys leg so you kind of say o k thats possible but when you get to the next level whether its tomb raider or the die hard series where youve got one guy with one pistol going up against 50 guys with machine guns or he jumps in a jet and starts chasing a car down a freeway you say im not sure i can really buy this mission impossible s like that they do things where you could not survive in the real world in indiana jones we stay just this side of it
415259 im the one that has to come up with the story and the macguffin the supernatural object that everyones going after
415260 i was raising my kids i was running my companies the last thing i wanted to do was go off and do another one of these things and it stayed there for quite a while until i was doing
415261 and finally we got to a point where everybody said look were
415262 and he had an idea that he kept pushing into script form and then theyd run it by me and id usually rebel and finally you know one script came along that really struck me as being smart not working too hard to give reference to the other films but that carried on the stories we had told so far in a logical way
415263 so that put it in the mid 50s and the macguffin i was looking at was perfect for the mid 50s i looked around and i said well maybe we shouldnt do a 30s serial because now were in the 50s what is the same kind of cheesy entertainment action movie what was the secret b movie of the 50s so instead of doing a 30s republic serial were doing a b science fiction movie from the 50s the ones im talking about are like the creature from the black lagoon the blob the thing so by putting it in that context it gave me a way of approaching the whole thing
415264 they already hate it so theres nothing we can do about that they hate the idea that were making another one theyve already made up their minds
415265 theyre always going to be upset why did he do it like this and why didnt he do it like this they write their own movie and then if you dont do their movie they get upset about it so you just have to stand by for the bricks and the custard pies because theyre going to come flying your way
415266 rockwell is terrific its become too tedious to pretend he isnt
415267 first of all they both have incredible chops as directors
415268 they both are wonderfully capable film directors and i think they have an ambition to communicate their ideas strange as it seems thats not always the case with directors i think it derives from a kind of empathy and an understanding of how the world works and how people behave and i think they also understand the culture so well that they are able to satisfy their own ambitions for a film and at the same time include the audience in the process neither of them is ashamed of making audience films
415269 theres a difference between throwing a puppy on a freeway and watching what happens and constructing a story
415270 you dont just put your main character in jeopardy and then that becomes entertainment thats why so many people have failed at this even though they may make some money it doesnt get to the level that the indiana jones films do theyre a lot more complex than that theyre like little watches that have a lot of pieces in them

415304 we are the people who keep the product coming out of the factory and they literally cant do it without us
415305 for years the industry has tried to divide show runners from the rank and file writing staff
415306 it will be a little like buying a harry potter book and having someone rip it out of your hands about halfway through
415307 what the companies probably underestimated is just how emotional and important this issue is not only to writers but all creative people
415308 its going to be very painful for nbc in the fourth quarter
415309 and we get the biggest traffic on nbc com as this business grows they are going to make more money than they ever made on tv theres a huge pot of money out there
415310 what prompted this is that in the 88 strike show runners were disenfranchised because they were almost seen as management and that was a mistake
415311 by not doing our producing duties we realized we could potentially shorten the strike
415312 it just really became clear that we depend on them to distribute our work and work very collaboratively but they need us too
415313 we have a pretty good track record of making high quality television and its not going to be so easy to find other people to do what we do
415314 ive worked 22 years and i finally with chuck lorre have my very first show and we are at our most vulnerable just as audiences are starting to discover us
415315 as a writer and a creative person i really do feel like each of these projects is my child that im trusting for people to take care of
415316 now i feel like my child is in school but theres a restraining order that i cant come within 500 feet of it i have to look at the bigger picture and say how much can i do without betraying the guild and how much cant i do without betraying my show its a horrible position to be put in
415317 writers are unnecessary i am bringing sexy back just see me straddle this desk

415322 is death the final destruction of all that makes us human
415323 comes in response to that renewing gift which god himself gives in the glorious resurrection of his own son this gift he gives not once but continually every day christ rises from the dead every day he is raised in the penitent
415324 he who loses his life for my sake shall find it
415325 the most necessary of all works the remembrance of death like all other blessings is a gift of god
415326 just as the fathers lay down that perfect love knows no sin so for my part i declare that a perfect sense of death is free from fear
415327 the use of firearms in war was considered cowardly and therefore not exploited by honorable warriors of self respect firearms would not develop in dynastic china not because of the absence of know how but because their use had been culturally circumscribed as not being appropriate for true warriors
415328 in the history of human progress willful rejection of many technological inventions is traceable to cultural preference
415329 this is the basis for concluding that the technological militarism of the west is of barbaric roots and that a civilization built on military power remains barbaric the reverse of modernity notwithstanding the guise of technology
415330 the oldest picture in the world of a gun and a grenade is on a painted silk banner found at dunhuang dating to the mid 10th century on the silk banner demons of mara the temptress an evil goddess are shown trying to harm the meditating buddha and to distract him from his pursuit of enlightenment with a proto gun in the form of a fire lance and a proto grenade in the form of a palm size fire bomb the fact that these weapons are shown to be used only by evil demons illustrates the distasteful attitude of the ancient chinese toward firearms
415331 gunpowder remained unknown in the west until the late 10th century
415332 however europeans abandoned outmoded rules of chivalry after the middle ages and enthusiastically incorporated firearms and artillery into the lexicon of their military arts after the late 15th century
415333 modernity as currently constituted in the west can also be viewed as a relapse of civilization toward barbarism through advanced technology
415334 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life
415335 the lord said in his heart i will never again curse the ground for mans sake although the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth nor will i again destroy every living thing as i have done
415336 greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends
415337 as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord i take no pleasure in the death of the wicked but rather that they turn from their ways and live turn turn from your evil ways why will you die o house of israel
415338 whoever desires to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever desires to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospels will save it
415339 he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins
415340 he who lives by the sword will perish by the sword
415341 vengeance is a chain and i left all my chains down in that jungle
415342 i am so happy there is no room for revenge
415343 for me it is very important to forgive it makes you more human a better person
415344 why they were inciting the people in such a way
415345 there is a certain circle of people who dont like these icons
415346 the officer gave me a sour look and asked what village i was from but that initial bravado disappeared when he saw that i was honest respectful and serious
415347 soon i saw he was baffled he even rang his superior in my presence to ask what he should do
415348 im prepared to have as many conversations with the officers as it takes
415349 this new measure is going to be beneficial for both the church and the army after all the orthodox church has always supported the idea of serving the motherland
415350 if priests are to be conscripted at all it must be only as chaplains
415351 they must be allowed to fulfill their duties without having to compromise and betray their beliefs
415352 a sign of blatant disregard for the canons of the orthodox church the restriction is set by apostolic rule number 83 anyone exercising military activities must be expelled from the priesthood
415353 breaking into churches and dragging priests off to the army would be shameful as a political successor of the ussr russia is still greatly indebted to the priests who perished in stalins purges
415354 several thousand young men desert the army every year because they cannot bear the humiliation beatings and extortion of money by the senior recruits
415355 russia has become a police state true to its name it has to constantly remind the people whos boss the other amendments are equally repressive just think about a young man having to leave a sick mother confined to her bed or a breast feeding wife with no income the authorities openly show that they see our citizens the way feudal lords saw their serfs
415356 communism changed the russian landscape by introducing neighborhoods filled with towering apartment blocks but because of official atheism they almost never had churches
415357 in densely populated bedroom communities there arent enough orthodox churches and residents have to travel to the town center were developing some innovative techniques in this sphere for people who want to build churches
415358 the role and authority of our churches to prevent the escalation of tensions and help restore good bilateral relations
415359 fails to meet the spirit of neighborliness and fraternity of the two peoples both sides have made mistakes in their attempts to normalize interstate relations i fear that the bilateral relations may reach a critical limit and plunge into uncontrollable processes we think that any confrontation armed conflicts or military actions are unacceptable because they will lead to irreversible consequences that is why we think that regardless of the difficulties of launching negotiations in the present day tense situation there is no alternative a peaceful dialogue is the only way out of the current situation
415360 there is a tragedy in iraq now because the promises made were never kept
415361 our natural resources which are tremendous must be utilized for the betterment of the iraqi people
415362 until now the infrastructure in iraq is in shambles and people are still waiting for basic necessities so they may live in a normal fashion we were promised clean water but what we got is blackwater
415363 under the strain of several hardships stemming from so many wars
415364 which in and of itself is an act of war
415365 people are aware that they can leave home alive and never return to their families
415366 my cathedral closed for a year and a half because of the lack of security
415367 it is very difficult to live under the shadow of death for so many years
415368 we appeal to all nations and lands to universally condemn all genocides that have occurred throughout history and those that continue through the present day
415369 the denial of these crimes is an injustice that equals the commission of the same
415370 today many countries of the world condemn the genocide made by the ottomans against the armenian people as john paul ii said when i was in rome
415371 the recent history of the armenian apostolic church has been written in the contrasting colors of persecution and martyrdom darkness and hope humiliation and spiritual re birth
415372 the rise in price is not only because of decline in supply
415373 it is artificially imposed by rises in fuel costs and other constraints more political than economic
415374 the long term solution is equity not charity equity is based on long term investment
415375 food prices have soared without an improvement in personal and family income
415376 current international economic and agricultural policies discourage africa from growing staple foods in favor of cash crops africa is the only continent which produces what it does not consume and consumes what it does not produce tropical africa has some of the best soils for agricultural production in the world why should those soils be used for the production of non staple agricultural commodities while some of its people go hungry every day
415377 the shortage will have serious repercussions on the economy and the health of tens of thousands of palestinians
415378 unfair distribution of water resources shared by the palestinians and israel
415379 access to water without discrimination is recognized by international law as a fundamental human right
415380 to allow the palestinian authority to develop new water sources
415381 even if there is a little amount of water in this area i believe there is enough for every human being but we need to plan for it and first of all make sure that every human being has enough drinking water god created the world and in this the water for all people not just for jews or palestinians or christians or any other group
415382 the average water consumption per capita of israelis is 3 5 times that of palestinians
415383 show me a verse in the koran where it is forbidden
415384 without science religion turns to radicalism and without religion science is blind and brings the world to danger
415385 in the countries where muslims live some religious leaders and immature muslims have no other weapon in hand than their fundamental interpretation of islam they use this to engage people in struggles that serve their own purposes

415389 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
415390 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
415391 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
415392 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

415397 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
415398 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
415399 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
415400 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
415401 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

415404 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
415405 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
415406 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
415407 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
415408 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
415409 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
415410 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
415411 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
415412 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
415413 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
415414 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
415415 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
415416 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
415417 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
415418 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
415419 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
415420 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
415421 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
415422 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
415423 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
415424 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
415425 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
415426 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
415427 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
415428 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
415429 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
415430 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
415431 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
415432 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
415433 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
415434 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
415435 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
415436 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
415437 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
415438 como es posible que la produccion de una empresa dependa de otra empresa m
415439 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
415440 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
415441 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
415442 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
415443 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
415444 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
415445 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
415446 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
415447 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
415448 who are open to doing something on the production side
415449 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
415450 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
415451 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
415452 qui marque la rencontre explosive entre lalternatif et le rap trackback
415453 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
415454 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
415455 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
415456 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
415457 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
415458 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
415459 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
415460 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
415461 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
415462 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
415463 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
415464 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
415465 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
415466 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
415467 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
415468 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
415469 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
415470 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
415471 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
415472 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
415473 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
415474 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
415475 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
415476 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
415477 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
415478 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
415479 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
415480 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
415481 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
415482 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
415483 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
415484 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
415485 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
415486 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
415487 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we

415581 man cannot live without love he remains a being that is incomprehensible for himself his life is senseless if love is not revealed to him if he does not encounter love if he does not experience it and make it his own if he does not participate intimately in it
415582 when he disembarked and saw the vast crowd his heart was moved with pity for them and he cured their sick
415583 taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he said the blessing broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples who in turn gave them to the crowds
415584 the holy eucharist is the final link in the sacred chain of life giving nourishment reaching from the remoteness of god into the here and now of human existence
415585 the mode of christs presence under the eucharistic species is unique it raises the eucharist above all the sacraments as the perfection of the spiritual life and the end to which all the sacraments tend in the most blessed sacrament of the eucharist the body and blood together with the soul and divinity of our lord jesus christ and therefore the whole christ is truly really and substantially contained this presence is called real by which is not intended to exclude the other types of presence as of they could not be real too but because it is presence in the fullest sense that is to say it is a substantial presence by which christ god and man makes himself wholly and entirely present
415586 johann baptist metz once said that the formula today is no to god yes to religion people want to have some kind of religion esoteric or whatever it may be but a personal god who speaks to me who knows me personally who has said something quite specific and who has met me with a specific demand and who will also judge me people dont want him what we see is religion being separated from god people dont want to do without this sensation of the wholly other this special religious feeling entirely they want it available in many shapes and forms but there is in the end no guarantee of its continuing to be there unless the will of god and god himself are also present in that sense we are not so much in the middle of a religious crisis religions are springing up all over the place as in the middle of a god crisis
415587 all you who are thirsty come to the water you who have no money come receive grain and eat come without paying and without cost drink wine and milk why spend your money for what is not bread your wages for what fails to satisfy
415588 man cannot live without love he remains a being that is incomprehensible for himself his life is senseless if love is not revealed to him if he does not encounter love if he does not experience it and make it his own if he does not participate intimately in it
415589 it is highly fitting that christ should have wanted to remain present to his church in this unique way since christ was about to take his departure from his own in his visible form he wanted to give us his sacramental presence since he was about to offer himself on the cross to save us he wanted us to have the memorial of the love with which he loved us to the end even to the giving of his life in his eucharistic presence he remains mysteriously in our midst as the one who loved us and gave himself up for us and he remains under signs that express and communicate this love
415590 when i was arrested i had to leave immediately with empty hands the next day i was permitted to write to my people in order to ask for the most necessary things clothes toothpaste i wrote please send me a little wine as medicine for my stomachache the faithful understood right away they sent me a small bottle of wine for mass with a label that read medicine for stomachaches they also sent some hosts which they hid in a flashlight for protection against the humidity the police asked me you have stomachaches yes heres some medicine for you i will never be able to express my great joy every day with three drops of wine and a drop of water in the palm of my hand i would celebrate mass this was my altar and this was my cathedral it was true medicine for soul and body medicine of immortality remedy so as not to die but to have life always in jesus as st ignatius of antioch says each time i celebrate the mass i had the opportunity to extend my hands and nail myself to the cross with jesus to drink with him the bitter chalice each day in reciting the words of consecration i confirmed with all my heart and soul a new pact and eternal pact between jesus and me through his blood mixed with mine those were the most beautiful masses of my life

415618 update officials say the woman died from a heart abnormality
415619 vi kan inte vara kvar och dela ansvaret f r det som premi rministern har gjort
415620 the story begins with the ending of my fathers religious life and the climax of my brothers career as the lead singer for the controversial band
415621 being one of the youngest of seven children of an abusive alcoholic father and a nurturing soft spoken mother religion was the only safe and consoling gift that guided his life and his dreams
415622 with little money in his pocket no knowledge of the english language little education and a dark complexion in the 1960s he landed at lax california and within six months he sent for his family
415623 one day after a prayer group meeting this lady approached my father with tears in her eyes and asked him for help she began explaining to him about the difficulties she was having with her teenage son that he had become satanic and pleaded with my father to come to her house and do a healing prayer session so my father agreed and took my mother along when they entered the house the boy was sitting there and was very upset at his mother for doing this my father thought he would be more comfortable if they prayed with him in private so he asked the boy if it would be better if they prayed in his room when they walked into the boys room my fathers face became pale and my mother was very nervous the first thing the saw was a poster of slayer on the wall with my brothers picture dead center so slayer was one of my fathers biggest challenges in life because of the love he had for his son and the financial support that he needed from him at the time
415624 i dont know if i have his consent but i do have his blessing and yes he is involved

415641 whoever believes in the son has eternal life but whoever rejects the son will not see life for gods wrath remains on him
415642 do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves
415643 the biggest mistake parents make is assuming their child doesnt know where the gun in the house is
415644 kids are smart and if they know theres a firearm in the house theyll probably figure out a way to get to it
415645 parents monitor their kids diet curfew and social life but when it comes to guns parents often just say respect the gun its off limits or guns are dangerous that type of parenting just doesnt work
415646 first you have to weigh whether or not you really need a weapon
415647 do the benefits outweigh the risks if the answer is yes you must take safety precautions
415648 tell them there is a firearm in the home but explicitly explain that guns are fatal no matter how children handle them dont keep the gun loaded and store the ammunition in a locked safe and carry the key with you at all times also dont hide the combination and dont give it an obvious numerical password
415649 the american academy of pediatrics recommends pediatricians ask parents about guns in their home in an effort called anticipatory guidance which attempts to keep children safe in cars on bikes and around swimming pools
415650 its rare that doctors initiate this conversation but they should
415651 also ask the parents of your childrens friends if they keep guns at home and if kids will be playing where theyre stored
415652 dont worry about appearing intrusive its better to seem pushy and be safe

415654 resolution is not the only factor that determines picture quality another is bit rate the number of bits per second that are being transmitted down the pipe to consumers bit rate is a subject that the cable and satellite providers never discuss but anyone who watches the various services can see that some channels are considerably softer looking than others

415657 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
415658 with active exploit code available in a common attack tool it is imperative that apple fix this vulnerability
415659 due to their involvement in the process and the ability of other vendors to fix their products in a timely fashion its hard to imagine any possible justification for apples tardy behavior

415676 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
415677 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
415678 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
415679 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
415680 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
415681 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
415682 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
415683 the problem seems to be growing faster than they can handle
415684 it is very clear that the bush administration wants to work with the democratic government and congress is very welcoming
415685 at the same time not everyone in washington fully understands that there has been a major change in pakistan and the new government has inherited several issues from the previous regime
415686 the military is just waiting around giving the civilian government enough rope to hang itself
415687 the u s wants to strengthen the government but knows full well that its going to be the military that will have to confront the militants
415688 its one thing to bomb a country that we dont need
415689 but if were going to keep bombing pakistan we need a wider strategy
415690 the isi has always been somewhat of a problem but now without a powerful president individuals already inclined to cause trouble now have freer rein to do it
415691 this is typical of the snp people care about whether their train runs on time not what colour it is painted repainting the rolling stock will be a huge waste of money we have to ask whether the snp is getting a government agency to use the saltire for their own nationalistic aims rather than simple patriotic pride in scotland which we all share
415692 people care about whether their train runs on time not what colour it is painted
415693 repainting the rolling stock will be a huge waste of money
415694 will be carried out during routine repainting to avoid extra costs
415695 we have to ask whether the snp is getting a government agency to use the saltire for their own nationalistic aims
415696 transport scotland whose own logo was inspired by the saltire stressed work on the new train design had started before the snp came to power last year
415697 this is all part of the snps independence by creep they know they cant have a straight fight on it because they would lose hands down so they try to brainwash people into independence instead with a strategy of incremental changes

415727 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
415728 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
415729 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling
415730 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional off shore drilling is wrong
415731 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done

415750 contract that creates an additional paid holiday eid al fitr a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
415751 union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
415752 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
415753 if this holiday is that important to them make them take it off instead of christmas day and allow all workers to be off labor day most american families have some type of function on labor day
415754 it says union leadership made this request makes you wonder who runs the union i guess they are already working on a plan to replace memorial day that means nothing to the muslims so why should we have the right to celebrate it labor day commemorates the plight of workers and the struggle of labor unions to improve working conditions for american workers the muslims will not stop until all of our rights and laws are changed to accommodate their beliefs this will be a new america but it will be their america
415755 diversity is one of the strengths of our union we may come from different countries and speak different languages but what unites us is the belief that by standing together we can better advance our interests
415756 the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians

415780 it is in fact a mistake to set the charismatic and institutional aspects of church life in opposition the one to the other both are necessary the floodwaters of the spirit will drain away ineffectively without vessels or channels to contain them and convey them to the areas where they are most needed the vessels or channels for their part need to be filled with the life giving water if they are not to be empty and useless the institutions or structures may be traditional but they are none the worse for that if they serve a useful purpose on the other hand to maintain institutions or structures for their own sake when they have outlived their usefulness is traditionalism of the wrong kind
415781 what sort of institutions or structures then should be regarded as most desirable light and flexible ones which can be maintained without undue cost and labor so long as they are servicable and be dismantled without regret when something more suited to the needs of a new day comes along some institutions are allowed to grow so old and venerable that the idea of scrapping them is unthinkably sacrilegious
415782 the church is the dwelling place of the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom 2 cor 3 17 structures of ministry government and order are of value so long as they provide vehicles for the free moving of the spirit when they cease to do that they should be replaced by more suitable ones

415966 in terms of foreign policy in the far east it is mistaken if someone were to say that my preoccupation was on the war on terror

415980 the cas has registered an appeal from fc barcelona against the decision made by the single judge of the fifa players status committee regarding the release of players for the olympic games
415981 this appeal will be handled together with the appeals filed by fc schalke 04 and werder bremen against the same fifa decision
415982 the cas will deliver its final ruling on or before 6 august 2008
415983 the judge determined that the international match calendar is not of relevance in establishing whether clubs are obliged to release players for the mens olympic football tournament
415984 taking part in the olympic games is a unique opportunity for all athletes of any sporting discipline
415985 it would not be justifiable to prevent any player younger than 23 from participating in such an event if his representative team had qualified
415986 from the beginning ive said that i want to play for my national team and ive never had problems until now
415987 if i get there and the cas says i have to come back then i will come back
415988 for the moment i want to be with my national team and my team mates
415989 we understand that it will be very difficult to retain the player and for him to take part in our tour of the united states
415990 the normal thing will be for him to now go to join argentina but if the cas makes a decision in our favour then he will have to come back

416000 keberanian sby jk untuk memberhentikan kedua menteri itu bukan hanya untuk menjaga kredibilitas pemerintahan tapi juga sangat penting untuk menjaga proses hukum berjalan dengan baik dan adil bila tidak proses hukum akan banyak mengalami hambatan
416001 ini sekaligus sebagai ujian bagi pemerintahan sekarang apakah benar benar ingin mewujudkan pemerintahan yang bersih dengan menyikat habis menteri menterinya yang bermasalah atau ingin malah ingin melindungi kepentingan mereka sendiri
416002 kalau saya tidak ada pilihan lain kecuali bertindak tegas ini demi rakyat demi pemerintahan yang bersih dan demi tegaknya hukum di indonesia sekalipun yang terlibat itu menteri

416101 austin texas produces yet another glorious batch of sublime freaks growing a glooping pulsating garden of acid fried driftetables and deconstructed space blooms vast open vistas of echoed out cosmic tones all given depth and dimension by the wandering lonely wails of human women folk blending all within a dream teetering on the edge of nightmare

416110 tapping into his french heritage through the work of the musique concrete pioneers maxime primault uses the world around him as his source material the results are first rate exercises in electro acoustic manipulation in which tones are shaped and matched to produce attenuated and considered drone studies primault also takes time out to run the crier dans les mus es label notable for the compilation cris et chuchotements featuring likeminded artists such as peter wright valerio cosi kuupuu and ghost brames of the cerfs

416136 he is held in fantastic esteem by our fans and everyone in the game
416137 by all the professional people who understand what loyalty and dedication is
416138 i think he is an inspiration not only to young players but players who want to have a long career in football how to dedicate yourself and look after yourself and be a professional properly
416139 in modern parlance you have to say that anyone who serves more than 10 years with a football club is exceptional
416140 with freedom of contract the bosman rule agents its very difficult to get players to stay that length of time particularly when they are not from your country thats even more difficult
416141 the respect the fans show is not just about scoring the winning goal in barcelona its his whole contribution over the long period
416142 it is not easy to play at a top club for such a long time you can only do that if you are a good player first of all and a good professional

416169 said noshe oceanic v p rajiv gupta the agency handles accounts of real estate developers like
416170 we have increased our advertising budget by another 20 due to recession in the market as well our stakes are high at the moment but things are going to get right in the next two three months
416171 its a do or die situation out there due to high recession in the market many developers are buying back their projects and reselling it is necessary to make a noise at this time to keep the projects on high visibility radar for those who actively trade on the real estate out of this increased budget the print media is taking up the major chunk while the rest goes to the outdoors out of a scale of 10 together advertising in print and outdoor could be rated as seven
416172 there has been a minor moderation because of liquidity crunch and many internal and external experiences have been re budgeted but i dont think the overall indication would be visible on an annual basis
416173 we have increased our promotional budget and see no reason why we should cut costs here
416174 developers are spending reasonably well in advertising to remain visible in the market those who are willing to spend are the biggies who have the stamina to spend more and make their presence felt when the market is down
416175 there has been no decrease in the advertising spends of the real estate companies rather there is an increase which is obvious from the number of ads they come up with on a daily basis in the print media i think it would take the next two quarter to understand how this had been affected

416177 the challenges of terrorism must be overcome in order for us to realise the potential of greater regional integration greater economic integration
416178 this terrorism is certainly one of the issues which for us is a very important part of the issues in the summit
416179 if we want to carry the saarcs economic and social agenda forward its essential that we manage to do this in an atmosphere free of violence
416180 we have to be creative and innovative in transporting the machines and in retrieving them after the elections
416181 from the main municipal hall to some barangays where the schools are located it sometimes takes two hours of travel the problem is the roads are so bad that even 4x4 vehicles have difficulty reaching the area
416182 another problem is the liguasan marsh in the easternmost part of the province since its a marshland the waters rise fast so we are using bancas
416183 we have five provinces and some of the places are remote but the fact is the counting station is different from the voting stations the precincts may be very remote but the counting centers are in schools with reasonable infrastructure
416184 so basically we are more or less 95 to 98 percent ready for august 11

416208 i write what i see write to make it right dont like where i be id like to make it like the sites on tv quite the great life so nice and easy
416209 your time might be now they played your freestyle over wipe me down they played it two times said it might be crowned as the best thing out the h town in a while
416210 joes a great keeper he came to tranmere rovers on loan a couple of seasons ago and played a few games i saw him at shrewsbury a few times too
416211 i think hes going to be an england regular hes got everything hes tall hes athletic hes a good kicker of the ball hes got good hands and feet hes got everything going for him
416212 as long as he keeps his feet on the ground hell be an england regular thats for sure
416213 when sven goran eriksson made joe first choice last season it was because he could see quality
416214 he had a look at kasper schmeichel and he had a look at joe he weighed the pros and cons up
416215 joe was coming through he had served his apprenticeship in the lower divisions he had come in made some good saves and had some good games

416217 tvnz hasnt made any decision yet about a replacement sports presenter
416218 at this stage were still doing screen tests for a good number of people
416219 the van smelt like a brewery you only had to poke your head in there and it was pretty obvious everybody was wholly under the influence of alcohol
416220 they had all been drinking quite a lot of alcohol both while being a passenger and while driving
416221 there was footage of the driver who eventually appeared in court driving in the lindis pass area swigging out of a bottle of beer from his left hand while driving right across the centre line and on the wrong side of the road
416222 that sort of behaviour shows absolutely no consideration for members of the public or other road users
416223 just outside queenstown there were some road works where they were forced to stop at a lollypop stop sign the driver got out and urinated on the side of the road in full view of a tourist bus and other members of the public
416224 this is a case of a group of tourists coming over here and having complete disregard and little respect for the rules and regulations of new zealand
416225 the drivers attitude and demeanour just blew us away he had no regard for his own safety for his mates safety or for the safety of other drivers on the road
416226 his holiday was cut short he paid less than 2000 in fines and went back to england to continue with his day to day life
416227 quite often tourists think because theyre on holiday road rules dont apply to them they drive at speed and under the influence of alcohol
416228 it is fair to say a large percentage of the alcohol related accidents causing death or injury are caused by tourists
416229 the ioc has always been very clear to say we would like the fullest access possible so that you and your colleagues can do your job
416230 thats clear for us its been clearly communicated in a number of meetings with organizers and the authorities they have given many pledges that that will be delivered
416231 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
416232 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
416233 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
416234 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
416235 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances
416236 we are continuing to work to have the organizers deliver what has been pledged what has been outlined
416237 thats a storybook ending right there manny getting traded here and coming up representing the winning run
416238 but brandon made some quality pitches and got the double play hes done his job pretty well all year
416239 i was just trying to see the ball and hit it he made a good pitch and got me out but tomorrows another day
416240 my mechanics have fallen into place over the last three or four games and im able to throw all of my pitches over for strikes now and stay away from the big inning
416241 throwing first pitch strikes i had some easy innings and it allowed me to stay out there
416242 it definitely ranks up there with one of the better moments ive had
416243 and for him to score the winning run its great stuff
416244 im lucky it stayed in the park because it was a bad pitch
416245 i tried to throw the breaking ball down and it stayed up
416246 maybe thats a typical finish for such a well pitched game
416247 having met these guys eight hours ago everybodys been extremely positive
416248 you jump around with those guys i felt like id been here all year we were like little kids
416249 it was all new to me it was very flattering
416250 it sounds like it was time for a change of scenery for both sides
416251 clark although many things have changed you will always be reighs father and i will always be reighs mother we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being in our hearts i ask you now please please bring snooks back there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
416252 reigh honey i love you and miss you so much remember youre always a princess
416253 im thinking im trying to help my friend clark whos trying to help me out of financial straits doing something as innocent as getting rid of somebody who is a pain in the butt
416254 and he is not an elitist though he has the education to be
416255 its the proudest moment i have had for a very long time something that happens once in a lifetime

416258 sitemaps are an easy way for webmasters to inform search engines about pages on their sites that are available for crawling in its simplest form a sitemap is an xml file that lists urls for a site along with additional metadata about each url when it was last updated how often it usually changes and how important it is relative to other urls in the site so that search engines can more intelligently crawl the site web crawlers usually discover pages from links within the site and from other sites sitemaps supplement this data to allow crawlers that support sitemaps to pick up all urls in the sitemap and learn about those urls using the associated metadata using the sitemap protocol does not guarantee that web pages are included in search engines but provides hints for web crawlers to do a better job of crawling your site
416259 this island is a paradise it will always be a paradise but the people in paradise are scared
416260 crack cocaine is the number one substance of abuse for our antiguan clients followed by alcohol it was the influx of crack that caused members of the community to approach clapton in the first place and it is still very visible particularly in some parts of the island which is leading to crime
416261 and i have no idea how many guns are here crime is spiking all over the caribbean these homicides here with young people involved they are usually drug related
416262 guns are in the wrong hands and these people have become trigger happy
416263 and i am in favour of the death penalty crack five necks and i believe many more will get the message
416264 i was brought down here to build a police force and we are finding a lot of good officers people who are intelligent and who want to work hard
416265 but i fight with my fists these people have guns
416266 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
416267 it was sort of this a ha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
416268 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
416269 not only increasing their offensive capability but also their defensive capability
416270 its pure snobbery however good a horsewoman i may be im also a glamour model that embarrassed the organisers
416271 eliza doolittle went to the races with henry higgins after a few elocution lessons in pretty woman julia roberts went to the polo straight from sunset boulevard but in the 21st century we have become even more class ridden unless you are a toff or an aspiring actress they dont want you
416272 polo should be for people who love horses not a media charade it should be about the sport horses are a wonderful hobby one that gets you outside and keeps you fit they should be for everyone little girls glamour girls working class girls like me no one should be excluded
416273 there are some facts that have been misrepresented chinawhite didnt ever receive any money from katie the claim that we took her money and then decided she wasnt good enough just isnt true
416274 shes also saying she gave us 6 000 but tables only cost 5 000 she gave the money to a third party to book a table for her and they were unsuccessful because the tables were already sold out theyre clearly going to rip her off a grand so i hope she gets a refund
416275 never offend people with style when you can offend them with substance
416276 think big even if you start small take the lead to create opportunities where not only money grows but where inspired ideas are pursued creativity is flourished and better ways are born innovate innovate innovate
416277 the filipino can be world class given the right attitude the right opportunity and the right training
416278 no matter where you are your being a filipino will always shine through constantly challenge yourself push forward move ahead and never stop trying to become better aim to be world class

416289 when i heard about the law lords ruling that was the first time in six years that i actually cried
416290 id pretty much managed to keep it together all these years but when i saw my girlfriend and mother crying i just couldnt any more
416291 i genuinely believe that we are the 51st state you see it everywhere you go not just our foreign policy but in our schools our hospitals and now our courts the british government simply bends over backwards for america
416292 it was more like probing snooping around and leaving messages what hackers call hactivism attack suggests some sort of malicious intent which there simply wasnt
416293 its a classic case of america using a sledgehammer to crack a nut
416294 there was a british hacker like me in the 1990s called matthew bevan and america labelled him the greatest threat to national security since adolf hitler i think they were hugely embarrassed that i got in i remember one reporter in the states telling me that the only major damage i had done was to egos of the top military brass
416295 i think about what i did every day if only i could build a time machine i would when i look back at my hacking days i was a completely different person i hardly slept washed or changed my clothes
416296 seeing what this has done to my family is the hardest part
416297 like any woman lucy wants to settle down and have kids but we can hardly do that with the threat of prison hanging over me
416298 i think if it came down to it and i had to spend time in a us jail i would survive but it would be really tough all the time you hear about the rapes and beatings just the other month i read an amnesty international report about how prison guards were using their stuns guns too much as someone accused of supposedly attacking their country i cant imagine id be too welcome either
416299 that might not sound all that good to you but its better than going to america

416342 we found one tied up to a tree at the ramada junction and one tied up near a busy shopping centre we find them abandoned at petrol stations and many get taken to the beach and dumped
416343 people need to know that dogs are not disposable you cannot get one when it suits you and then throw it in the street when you get bored or need to leave
416344 it seems that the excuses are getting around now as more and more people tell us that they are leaving for somewhere where they cannot take their dogs
416345 however if i had had my dog for nine years as some owners here have then i would not relocate somewhere i couldnt take them
416346 although it is great to see these animals have a safe place to stay with regular food and water and a bed to sleep on it is heartbreaking to watch them jumping at their gates desperate for any affection they can get from a passer by
416347 it is clear that many of them would make great pets and all they need is a chance to show someone that to relinquish all responsibility for a pet because it doesnt suit you anymore is callous beyond belief pets are not plants that you can uproot and throwaway whenever you fancy
416348 anyone interested can come along and help as we need all the assistance we can get especially at this time of the year
416349 peter got some great shots and as accompaniata he got some we couldnt get as singers

416401 it is with a combination of regret and relief that i tender my resignation i regret that i will not be a part of the team which will implement many good ideas that will benefit dracut children
416402 a very positive school district that is looking forward and not back the energy in georgetown around their schools is invigorating
416403 since the ad was placed we have had many discussions he has involved me in many if not most of the issues that currently face dracut
416404 i think we could have done some great things together and i truly regret that the school committee put both he and i in this situation
416405 we were trying to work with him and told him that we were waiting until a new superintendent was hired after dr mullin was hired we again told him that we would wait for a recommendation from the superintendent he indicated that he was fine with that
416406 the superintendent is the person who is going to have to work closely with the business manager so he should really be the one who hires that position
416407 but im sure some use it as a crutch i cant let it affect me but i do believe everybodys gotta answer to a higher power someday

416443 a week is a long time in rugby and tonight proved that
416444 we gave the all blacks a lot of field position and possession by poor discipline
416445 we wanted to go out there and be positive but unfortunately when you give away penalties and dont play to your field positions its pretty hard to play rugby
416446 that the line outs really seemed to stall our continuity
416447 we tried to get down there inside the all blacks half and when we did get down there they contested the line out extremely well and made it very hard for us

416478 we had knowledge of fabians situation prior to the trade we made for him

416480 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today

416489 human rights has become more than just a theory for the public
416490 in the past they petitioned and complained about injustice but that wasnt about defending their rights they let the higher authorities to decide their rights
416491 what they are asking for now is a change in the system and this reflects a widespread change in attitude
416492 i saw a gap between the official story and the reality which was mind blowing like the presence of the armed police
416493 so i put some of these things on the internet on my personal blog
416494 the media has made a huge step forward from the 80s
416495 would have been impossible for the public to know about in the past
416496 today even the farmers in remote areas have satellite tvs
416497 so whenever they see an election such as the one held in pakistan recently they may wonder why even though we have approximately the same economic conditions they can elect their top leaders and we cant even vote for the leader of a small county i think a consciousness of political rights has increased more than anything
416498 there has been progress but its so slow that sometimes one becomes pessimistic
416499 its empty talk to speak of having an independent judiciary if the party leads everything
416500 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

416570 it has been my dream to take the regions cuisine to the global market i am glad that through support from friends and food connoisseurs spread across the world my dream will soon materialise
416571 the best part about northeastern cuisine is that it is not only mouth watering but is quite healthy and simple to cook
416572 due to the introduction of global food habits across the region in the last two decades the new generation has almost lost interest in the food prepared by our grandmothers but the three eateries started by lahkar in the last few years have revived the lost glory of northeastern food
416573 after visiting my eateries in guwahati many assamese nris have asked me to popularise assamese cuisine in the global market to gauge the response to northeastern delicacies outside the region i visited bangkok london and paris to name a few
416574 less of oil and lots of herbs and organic food products is the secret behind the taste of ethnic cuisine from the northeast moreover our dishes are very innovative and quite different from usual indian dishes which is its usp
416575 if chicken beef pork and mutton form the integral part of the northeastern food spread then vegetarian fare can have various items such as kosu shak egyptian arum dhekia shak a species of fern bon shak wild herbs posolar khar banana stem to name a few
416576 whenever i am in guwahati i make it a point to visit one of lahkars eateries to taste authentic cuisine of northeast
416577 the rescue teams from secunderabad kazipet and vijaywada were immediately rushed to the spot and burning coaches were detached from the train
416578 those who are promoting terrorism are part of the ruling parties
416579 another piece of evidence that the problems the company faces have no short term fixes and we would continue to avoid the shares
416580 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
416581 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
416582 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
416583 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
416584 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
416585 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
416586 but its now or never thats the trap for them
416587 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
416588 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
416589 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
416590 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
416591 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
416592 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
416593 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
416594 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
416595 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
416596 nationally an approximate 2 501 employees representing around 16 of telkoms workforce in the bargaining unit has heeded the call for industrial action by the sa communications union sacu and the communication workers union cwu as part of a planned industrial action from august 1 to 5
416597 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
416598 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
416599 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
416600 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
416601 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
416602 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
416603 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
416604 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
416605 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
416606 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
416607 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
416608 hence the schedule of activities as per the disclosure in the public announcement will undergo a change
416609 the revised schedule of activities in respect of the offer pertaining to the acquisition of the equity shares of the target company ranbaxy laboratories will be announced separately after receiving sebis observations
416610 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
416611 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
416612 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
416613 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
416614 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
416615 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
416616 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
416617 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
416618 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
416619 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
416620 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
416621 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
416622 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
416623 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
416624 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
416625 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
416626 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
416627 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
416628 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
416629 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
416630 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
416631 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
416632 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
416633 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
416634 autumnal nothing to do with leaves it is to do with a certain brownness at the edges of the day brown is creeping up on us take my word for it russets and tangerine shades of old gold flushing the very outside edge of the senses deep shining ochres burnt umber and parchments of baked earth reflecting on itself and through itself filtering the light at such times perhaps coincidentally the leaves might fall somewhere
416635 the lovely warm feeling of satisfaction resulting from enthusiastic reviews
416636 see the pyramids along the nile just remember darling all the while you belong to me
416637 see the pyramids along the nile just remember till youre home again you belong to me
416638 i forgive myself for this and i will do better next time
416639 what a wonderful opportunity i now have to find a better job one that i love and more money
416640 thank you my friend for showing me that i need to love myself more so that you can love me
416641 they reading and writing deepen and widen and expand our sense of life they feed the soul
416642 like singing on a boat during a terrible storm singing can change the hearts and spirits for the people who are on the ship
416643 the truth to the experience can only come through in your own voice
416644 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
416645 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
416646 a pongsat is an experiment that fits inside of a ping pong ball
416647 it was like okay this day im going this day im not
416648 and then it got to a point where if i didnt go it would be too weird
416649 basically what we talked about was before i put limitations on what you can and cannot do the door is gonna be open for ya
416650 youre going to get an opportunity to show me what youre able to do and things we want you to avoid it was basically just giving him the rope to see what he could do with it
416651 i think just because he had me since day one he was compelled to micromanage and make sure he controlled things i was doing on the floor
416652 at first it was pretty much his way or the highway
416653 but the more time i spent the more of a compromise we got
416654 you just come in and do what youre good at and try to get them to accept you as a player
416655 and i did that in new jersey in one game
416656 everyone wants to embrace the point guard because they want the ball
416657 those guys are usually the most popular guys on the team because they decide when and how you catch it its usually the big guy whos alone in the corner
416658 we had a good sense watching them play and watching them work out we got a great sense of what they do and how to be effective
416659 when i got here i was a 6 3 2 guard
416660 and they kind of developed me into a point guard and taking on those leadership roles
416661 you could see in our demeanor as we came out we just kind of ran through the regular season
416662 it didnt end the way we wanted to but was definitely in our mindset
416663 trying to go from the intensity we were at to playoff intensity
416664 when were getting up and down the floor offensively playing a lot out of transition scoring a lot of points
416665 i didnt realize offensively he could do as many things as hes done for us so far
416666 he had better vision than we thought he sees guys hes able to get the ball to guys so offensively hes better than we thought
416667 i think devin really this year was the first year he got an opportunity both in dallas and here to take a little more ownership in the team
416668 i feel like hes really really gonna benefit from training camp from just getting acclimated plus i think he can really assert himself take another step
416669 i think in order for us to be successful its something i have to do they wanted me for a reason and obviously good teams with good point guards usually have good leadership but i definitely have to put my stamp on it and really make it my own
416670 im just focused on trying to get jersey back to the playoffs and then everything goes from there
416671 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
416672 ini keterlaluan pak masa untuk rakyat miskin saja masih dibisniskan saya yakin ini bukan sekedar akal akalan rt tapi sudah perintah dari lurah tak mungkin rt berani kalau bukan karena ada ijin lurah

416681 he thought he should have gone in the top five and wants to prove it
416682 ive been working on my pull up jumpers off the dribble from 15 feet out to make sure that that is a knockdown 100 percent of the time bucket
416683 as always im working on reading the floor and really just getting stronger to keep my body healthy to make it through a full season
416684 i think at the end of the day with something like this itll make the decision for you
416685 anyones body is only going to let you do what its going to let you do thats the thing i havent really mentally started adjusting to the notion of retirement and thinking like that i guess my body will let me know
416686 and if he played two years without a problem the fifth year would be guaranteed
416687 teams are openly saying that they are positioning their salary cap and rosters to have space for these players
416688 i for one believe that teams should openly rebuild and say as our team is constructed we cant win a title
416689 and the other problem with this philosophy is what if lebron or d wade dont leave and come to any of these teams so now you have no superstar and you have retarded whatever process your team had made these last couple of years all these teams that are getting rid of salary cant sign lebron and or d wade and would signing carmelo anthony or chris bosh really be worth postponing your teams progression
416690 i dont hear the owners in new jersey saying tickets cheaper this year because we want lebron in 2010
416691 i wont play here because its too far from my family
416692 often i catch myself thinking and imagining about the olympics right now to have the olympics right at our front door and look and see the stadium and its all chinese fans this is something i am really excited about
416693 i am confident that me and yao ming will be at our best shape ahead of the games

416698 a few people are sleeping on my guy when i see people talking about whos about to become the top players coming into the league i havent heard his name mentioned as much as i would like but hes going to be one of the top young players in the nba
416699 he was either the most gifted scorer in the nation or was pretty darn close
416700 youre going through the motions youve gotta be kidding me
416701 is he talking to me its halftime and i have 20 come on coach you cant be serious
416702 we had a hell of a year man we had a hell of a year of course we came up short but dont let nobody see us weak its no reason for us to hold our heads down
416703 many families without immigration status or even families with a legal immigration status would call me asking for help
416704 his father would not allow him to go to college because he had to go to work to help sustain his household he sent me his school report card which had very very high marks at that particular moment i had not started the foundation yet thus i did not know how to help him but i must say that that letter touched me very much
416705 now im more and more able to choose the best one for my image
416706 financially its been great ive made a lot of money i love it theres more to it than just making the money its given me a chance to travel the world and meet different people from all over the world
416707 they had significant cap room and they tried to give it to tracy mcgrady and they tried to give it to kevin garnett at different times and it didnt work
416708 thats the misnomer about having cap space if you have a team thats just not very good to think that you are going to get a top quality free agent is kind of pie in the sky

416725 dalam sebuah artikel yang ditulis peneliti perancis disebut ada garis antara alexander agung atau yang lebih dikenal dengan iskandar zulkarnaen dengan sultan palembang

416728 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
416729 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
416730 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
416731 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
416732 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
416733 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
416734 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
416735 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

416756 the hostel management says that the boys died because of a fall in the toilet but the people suspect some foul play we are however investigating the matter security all over the town mainly around the ashram and the hostel run by it has been beefed up to avoid any untoward incident
416757 only the parents and the guardians interested to see their children or who want to take them back are being allowed entry inside the premises no untoward incident has been reported since morning

416782 we have made our position abundantly clear to the israelis and indeed to the world not just in our public statements but in our private conversations as well
416783 there is uniformity across the u s government about the way to proceed with iran

416861 the selling of signed limited edition wildlife art prints was what really got it going

416863 have you seen the new commercial the mccain campaign compares barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton and today the obama campaign released an ad comparing john mccain to zsa zsa gabor and bea arthur
416864 mccain is not backing down hes defending the commercial where he compared barack obama to paris hilton as being all talk and little action thats what he said like paris barack obama is all talk and little action really has he seen her sex video there is no talk it is all action
416865 a new campaign ad from john mccain unfavorably compares barack obama and britney spears
416866 barack obama told tom brokaw the other day what hes looking for in a vice president is someone who would tell him when he s wrong wouldnt hillary be the best candidate shes been telling him hes been dead wrong since the beginning on this
416867 theres excitement in the air over the olympics also lead arsenic benzene
416868 the olympics start next week for some reason theyre having them in beijing and the government right now is very hard at work trying to cover up all the horrible things they do in that country every day its like when your mom comes to visit your dorm
416869 it looks like hillary clinton still has a shot at being vice president yeah if john mccain picks her
416870 the latest politic gossip is that hillary clinton is not particularly high on barack obamas vice presidential list in fact turns out shes somewhere between the reverend wright and jesse jackson
416871 and according to the tv show extra former vice president dan quayle remember him hes in the running to join the cast of dancing with the stars thats true dan quayle you remember he was vice president under the first george bush see that was back in the day when the president was smart and the vice president was an idiot now of course everythings turned around
416872 time magazine says that many top republicans are worried that lately john mccain has been taking too negative a tone when he heard this mccain said shut your piehole good for him
416873 i dont like this silent picking thing i think obama should pick his vice president the old fashioned way put 16 candidates in a mansion make out with them in a hot tub and eliminate them one by one
416874 heard about this group called prayer at the pump there are prayer groups that are springing up and they go to gas stations and they hold hands and they pray for lower gas prices otherwise known as the bush energy plan
416875 now you think im exaggerating but they had a practice today in beijing for the olympics and a javelin thrower threw the javelin up into the air and it stuck
416876 while barack obama was campaigning in germany he spoke to a half million people in germany a half million people and while he was doing that john mccain he wasnt laying around no no john mccain was out driving in his driveway and he backed over the mailbox
416877 the mayor of denver announced if people at the democratic convention sleep in his park he will turn the sprinklers on them and he said if john edwards and his girlfriend show up he will turn the hose on them so there you go
416878 theres a million of these jokes poor john mccain the media is so in love theyre all over barack obama and mccain cant get any media attention did you see what mccain did today he kept getting in and out of his limo today with no underwear on just to get the photographers

416891 i only have vague memories of that first ceremony but this is one unveiling that i will remember for the rest of my life
416892 the mayor had the foresight the vision and influence to network and use his resources to build this great structure
416893 that is the type of man that i want to pattern my administration after that is the kind of man that i look up to
416894 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
416895 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
416896 he was the only for real author that i knew
416897 and i was getting this feedback from friends and family saying it was impacting their lives
416898 and im going youre asking a total clueless moron you know
416899 it was kind of a scary experience for us to print 10 000
416900 we had no channels for distribution other than a web site but it just took off within a couple of months we had sold through the first 10 000 and had to print another 22 000
416901 and then we sold 800 000 copies by the end of the first year
416902 some sort of blogging campaign that im not sure even ran
416903 we noticed that when people ordered copies of the book within a week or two we would get an order for 24 more copies in the same city then wed get 24 people in the community ordering multiple copies
416904 you have to understand that i dont know this business at all and so the numbers didnt make any sense to me
416905 when people inside the industry started telling me what a phenomenon this was i was still shaking my head and going uh you know this is not exactly because were so brilliant
416906 there isnt anyone on the planet that hasnt suffered something that really hurt them and they didnt know how to make sense of it this book doesnt provide trite little platitudes it meaningfully walks through the dilemmas
416907 we had run it in our stores for quite some time and of course it was a title of exceptional interest to our customers
416908 and really it was an encouragement to a lot of them especially those dealing with broken relationships or personal tragedies
416909 we felt really strongly that the benefits of the book outweighed theological concerns in this case and especially because the shack is a work of christian fiction
416910 we do take some sacred cows and tip them over to get people to think about it but it is put forth in the form of a novel
416911 because we really want to do the movie the way we want to
416912 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
416913 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
416914 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
416915 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
416916 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
416917 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
416918 one time he demonstrated his juggling skills by lying on his back in the department and juggling with his hands
416919 the roman catholic church should learn from other equally worthy christian denominations and eagerly welcome female clergy as well as married clergy
416920 there are people who you just know are ticking bombs
416921 i recall my first time with a condom i was 16 or so
416922 if it were true that money were being offered to me it would be the worst form of corruption
416923 anybody that knew bruce through his church affiliation is just dumbfounded
416924 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people
416925 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
416926 world renowned and highly decorated scientist who served his country for over 33 years
416927 ive talked to several friends and were all just really sad and shocked i hate to see him painted as a person who couldve done this

416939 we have not had any discussion or agreement of the so called timeline of two weeks
416940 the policemen were overstretched trying to prevent mobs from setting afire the government buildings and vehicles hence the army had to be called out
416941 the situation is taking a grim turn these are difficult times and we will have to take difficult decisions to deal with the situation

416943 anything you can do the patriots can do it better
416944 these findings are significant because the national health and nutrition examination survey shows 58 percent of all current drinkers in the united states reported usual alcohol consumption that exceeded the dietary guidelines and 52 percent of all current drinkers reported at least one episode of binge drinking in the past year
416945 most people who consume alcohol in the united states drink in ways that may increase their risk of the metabolic syndrome and related conditions
416946 since more than half of current drinkers in our study drank in excess of the dietary guidelines limits and reported binge drinking prevention efforts should focus on reducing alcohol consumption to safer levels
416947 unfortunately few physicians screen their patients about alcohol use or are knowledgeable about guidelines that define low risk or moderate drinking
416948 thinking about the ohio budget what area of state government would you most like to see the state of ohio spend more money on

416957 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
416958 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
416959 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
416960 though realizing that many other factors were involved i reasoned that if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance for lasting peace
416961 the greatest act of political courage that i have ever witnessed
416962 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
416963 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
416964 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
416965 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
416966 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
416967 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
416968 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
416969 gets nearly all its facts wrong e very number in the ad is wrong except one and even that number is rounded upward so generously as to flunk third grade arithmetic
416970 snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true
416971 has resorted to lies and distortions in what sounds like an increasingly desperate attempt to slow down sen barack obama t hese baseless attacks are raising more questions about the republicans campaign and his ability to control his temper
416972 the mccain commercial on this subject is completely wrong factually wrong
416973 so is that your campaign you know shtick right now that he is sort of out of the mainstream elite
416974 honestly i dont think we are focusing on it youre the one bringing it up today
416975 newly aggressive campaign to define mr obama as arrogant out of touch and unprepared for the presidency
416976 included some assertions from the mccain campaign that have been widely dismissed as misleading
416977 i have become the symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
416978 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
416979 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
416980 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
416981 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
416982 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
416983 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
416984 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
416985 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
416986 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
416987 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
416988 the commonwealth cannot afford to ignore the negative effects of global warming and climate change any longer
416989 sea temperatures continue to rise storm intensity is predicted to heighten and our economy the publics health and our precious ecosystem are in jeopardy
416990 if global warming and climate change continue to remain unchecked in the commonwealth the cost of inaction will be in the billions
416991 we can effectively end our reliance on fossil fuels by aggressively increasing our reliance on renewable energy sources solar wind geothermal
416992 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
416993 the greenhouse gas reductions goals laid out in this bill are exceedingly aggressive perhaps to the point of being unattainable and could only be achieved through greatly increased costs for consumers and for employers
416994 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
416995 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

416997 you know its not about you its about your country
416998 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
416999 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
417000 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
417001 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
417002 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
417003 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
417004 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
417005 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
417006 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
417007 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
417008 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
417009 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
417010 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
417011 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
417012 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
417013 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
417014 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
417015 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
417016 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
417017 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
417018 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
417019 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
417020 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
417021 war is the supreme test of man in which he rises to heights never approached in any other activity
417022 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
417023 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
417024 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
417025 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
417026 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
417027 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
417028 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
417029 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
417030 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
417031 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
417032 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
417033 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
417034 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
417035 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
417036 beware of those powers which come from god but which can so easily be purloined by the devil
417037 a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural or exceptional powers or qualities
417038 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
417039 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
417040 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
417041 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
417042 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
417043 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
417044 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
417045 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
417046 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
417047 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
417048 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
417049 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
417050 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
417051 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
417052 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
417053 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
417054 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
417055 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
417056 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
417057 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
417058 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
417059 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
417060 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
417061 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
417062 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
417063 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
417064 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
417065 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
417066 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
417067 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
417068 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
417069 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
417070 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
417071 there is not much that evangelicals have in common with the policies promoted by barack obama
417072 despite his best efforts to court people of faith voters understand the difference between lip service and public service and john mccains record is much more in line with the values of the evangelical community
417073 one thing that it clearly is indicative of this poll is that this nation cares about the christian values and ethics of a candidate for national office and it makes enough difference that the news media reports on it
417074 people of faith have always been involved in the political process they have a patriotic and scriptural obligation to do so it is to be ignored at the candidates peril
417075 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
417076 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
417077 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
417078 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
417079 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
417080 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
417081 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
417082 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
417083 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
417084 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
417085 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
417086 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
417087 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
417088 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
417089 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
417090 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
417091 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
417092 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
417093 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
417094 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
417095 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
417096 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
417097 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
417098 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
417099 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
417100 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
417101 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
417102 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
417103 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
417104 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
417105 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
417106 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
417107 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
417108 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
417109 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
417110 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
417111 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
417112 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
417113 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
417114 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
417115 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
417116 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
417117 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
417118 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
417119 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
417120 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
417121 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
417122 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
417123 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
417124 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
417125 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
417126 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
417127 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
417128 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
417129 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
417130 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
417131 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
417132 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
417133 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
417134 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
417135 today i challenge our nation to commit itself to becoming 100 apple users within the next ten years
417136 ask not what ford can do for you ask what gm product you can buy
417137 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
417138 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
417139 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
417140 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
417141 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
417142 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
417143 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
417144 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
417145 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
417146 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
417147 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
417148 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
417149 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
417150 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
417151 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
417152 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
417153 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
417154 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
417155 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
417156 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
417157 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
417158 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
417159 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
417160 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
417161 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
417162 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
417163 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
417164 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
417165 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
417166 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
417167 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
417168 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
417169 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
417170 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
417171 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
417172 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
417173 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
417174 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
417175 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
417176 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
417177 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
417178 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
417179 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
417180 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
417181 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
417182 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
417183 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
417184 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
417185 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
417186 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
417187 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
417188 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
417189 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
417190 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
417191 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
417192 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
417193 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
417194 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
417195 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
417196 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
417197 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
417198 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
417199 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
417200 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
417201 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
417202 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
417203 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
417204 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
417205 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
417206 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
417207 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
417208 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
417209 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
417210 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
417211 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
417212 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
417213 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
417214 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
417215 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
417216 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
417217 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
417218 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
417219 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
417220 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
417221 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
417222 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
417223 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
417224 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
417225 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
417226 insecurity has spread to areas which were previously relatively stable in parts of north northwest and central afghanistan
417227 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
417228 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardizing the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
417229 the needs of its people cannot be met by the government and the u n alone
417230 i like jerry but i think a new ceo is needed
417231 i fear giving it to my children directly unless i boil it
417232 iraq is on the cusp of a serious water crisis that requires immediate attention and resources
417233 up to now we have seen nothing from the government
417234 i had fever headaches and was throwing up all the time
417235 when i was a kid it was blue and clean
417236 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
417237 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
417238 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
417239 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
417240 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
417241 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
417242 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
417243 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
417244 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
417245 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
417246 a source close to amazon with direct knowledge of the numbers
417247 it is not crazy to suggest that life actually started on mars and found its way to earth
417248 the new york times give you the lowdown on ten things that you shouldnt bother worrying about on your vacation
417249 no matter how guilty you feel about your carbon footprint you dont have to swelter on the highway to the beach after doing tests at 65 miles per hour the mileage experts at edmunds com report that the aerodynamic drag from opening the windows cancels out any fuel savings from turning off the air conditioner
417250 john mccain doesnt tell us what we hope to hear beautiful words cannot make our lives better
417251 who can you thank for rising prices at the pump
417252 do you feel that thrill running up your leg yet
417253 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
417254 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
417255 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
417256 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
417257 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
417258 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
417259 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
417260 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
417261 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
417262 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
417263 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
417264 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
417265 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
417266 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
417267 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
417268 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
417269 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
417270 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
417271 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
417272 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
417273 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
417274 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
417275 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
417276 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
417277 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
417278 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
417279 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
417280 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
417281 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
417282 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
417283 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
417284 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
417285 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
417286 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
417287 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
417288 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
417289 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
417290 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
417291 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
417292 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
417293 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
417294 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
417295 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
417296 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
417297 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
417298 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
417299 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
417300 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
417301 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
417302 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
417303 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it

417313 we were on this beach and talking to this 12 year old boy who was showing us shells and sea urchins when this man with a t shirt wrapped around his head came out of nowhere
417314 the little lad who had been with us tried to stop him but the bandit put his gun to his stomach and he backed off
417315 then he pointed the gun at us it was not terrifying at the time it was surreal it wasnt until it was all over that we felt frightened
417316 there are some really nice people there but there are a lot of bandits we would not go back there again

417327 he was the last person you would have suspected to be involved in something like this
417328 he always was upbeat with a big smile it was colonel franz let me tell you what im doing i think of him as a geek his pants too short and his pocket protector showing he had a kind of 1960s look

417344 the university of arts london is a great institution and a jewel in the crown of british higher education
417345 it has a higher profile and recognition overseas than it does in the uk it is the leading art and design institution in europe if not the world that prestige and profile is not least because of the alumni produced
417346 but its increasingly difficult for institutions like this to remain competitive in world terms unless they receive some more support not just from government we need more philanthropists and trusts and foundations to support us
417347 we dont tend in this country to have a tradition of supporting the learning institutions in a way what we are doing is investing in institutions presenting the art of yesterday and maybe today but we are trying to develop the talent that will fill our creative industries into the future
417348 we need to see a shift towards financing the learning centres that will be the engines for tomorrow
417349 theres a sense in the uk that that isnt something that philanthropists need to worry about because its government that should fund education
417350 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

417364 id say the cost of feed has doubled in the past few years
417365 the kids track their project costs and theres a definite increase this year
417366 the trip twice a day out to where their projects are can also be expensive for the students and their families
417367 were worried about how many members of the community will be able to come out and bid with the way the economy is
417368 i dont see how in this economy customers are expected to absorb these price increases
417369 it does not seem like an appropriate or an acceptable course of action im sure the puco will look at it very carefully

417391 the band didnt leave town to record fleet foxes yet it sounds like it could have been recorded anywhere in the united states austin minneapolis chicago brooklyn louisville or more likely some clearing in the woods that placelessness constitutes an active effacement considering that seattle has been a locus for alternative music for nearly two decades

417408 he parted with the greatest glory he underwent the greatest misery he doth the greatest works that ever were because he loves his spouse because he values believers what can more what can farther be spoken how little is the depth of that which is spoken fathomed how unable are we to look into the mysterious recesses of it he so loves so values his saints as that having from eternity undertaken to bring them to god he rejoices his soul in the thoughts of it and pursues his design through heaven and hell life and death by suffering and doing in mercy and with power and ceaseth not until he bring it to perfection

417425 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
417426 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
417427 i will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
417428 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
417429 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
417430 if its some jerk i went out on a couple of dates with i can do without that drama
417431 text messaging someone i would prefer not to see you again is really not my style
417432 but at the same time i wanted to avoid an awkward conversation
417433 were in this mode where were telling everybody everything all the time
417434 it becomes about saying things just blathering on were at the apex of that trend
417435 you pretend to be communicating when youre actually stifling communication
417436 a phone conversation is like wildfire you dont know where its going to go
417437 were slaves to our devices blackberries and phones reachable 24 7

417442 one who disapproves of barack obama and intends not to vote for him this coming november
417443 was i disappointed by his attitude not at all i found him to be very serious and focused
417444 he wanted to leave chelsea i am certain of that although it created a lot of anxiety for him and in fact he remained because of family matters
417445 he stayed for his father who he is extremely close to and for his whole environment therefore he was unable to create that split that they expected and we were hoping for
417446 inter coach jose mourinho did hope for this move but we knew it was going to be difficult
417447 so instead we thought of a player who in terms of age and wages is a good deal i am happy that sulley ali muntari has arrived
417448 if id have asked he would have given him to me
417449 he would be great in italy because he is always interested in different types of football
417450 he loves knowing about football and thats why he wouldnt have much of a problem adapting
417451 si no pasa nada antes del 31 de agosto me quedar aqu

417453 veremos si soy capaz de adaptarme a estas condiciones climatol gicas que es lo que m s me preocupa

417459 by the end of the week i felt physically sick of myself i was totally consumed of myself to the point that i couldnt take it anymore
417460 i suddenly thought that if i cant take it what would everyone visiting the show think
417461 hopefully though they will be able to cut off that tracey bit and just see the work
417462 hopefully they will feel the highs and lows going up and down with each room and will have a different emotional experience in each one
417463 the bed was a fantastic seminal piece of work and the tent everyone i have ever slept with 1963 1995 1995 was great and another seminal piece for me but there was a lot of work done before that its not all about me and hopefully people will discover some of my other work
417464 the last kind of artist i would ever want to be is an impressionist so it is really the polar opposite to this show and i think thats great
417465 it would be nice if everyone who went to see the impressionists also came here and vice versa
417466 edinburgh is definitely ready for this exhibition people here are less cynical maybe they are very straight with you and say what they think and i have had a lot of people saying they really like my work
417467 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
417468 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
417469 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
417470 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
417471 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
417472 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured

417484 our expectation is for the economic environment to continue to be weak and to likely get weaker and for the capital markets to remain under stress
417485 during the voting on the motion some party mps were absent while some voted against the party whip though party has immediately shown them the door bjp is analysing as to why they betrayed the party and what steps should be taken to avoid repetition of such a practice
417486 so long as anyone can take decision against members without following the partys laid down rules and guidelines such actions will be voided
417487 even calling me to hear what i have to say in defence of our collective action
417488 as a loyal and respectable member of the party i humbly came to appear before the committee
417489 which turned out to be a general invitation to members of the public
417490 i saw an opportunity to better my life and better my future in sporting achievements and in my career
417491 ive set myself up for the next couple of decades financially and at least i have a stable base to work from
417492 we have a group game on 13 august against great britain and ill be playing against some old friends
417493 but youve got to beat everybody on the path to winning the gold
417494 i had played for scotland since i was 15 and gone through the junior ranks eventually making the senior squad
417495 to play for the national team in holland is not really a financial benefit but it definitely is at club level playing out there has allowed me to live the life that i am living right now
417496 ive no regrets none at all there were a few things said when i started such as turncoat and what have you
417497 then people realised why i was doing it and ive received a lot of support in the end
417498 ive achieved my goal of getting into a national team and im now here at the olympics and trying to win a gold medal
417499 we played a friendly game against china and it was 47 degrees
417500 we will construct all that we are supposed to construct and pay all money due to the developer as soon as possible
417501 the traders should desist from making sacrifices instead they should slaughter the cows and eat with their families
417502 when we eat without washing our hands not minding what we touch with our hands we stand the risk of contacting series of diseases
417503 even though the wife of the state governor mrs talatu jang has since taken upon herself the responsibility of enlightening our rural women men children and youth
417504 we want to implement policies and take action we want to mobilise communities particularly women groups school children and youths to imbibe better sanitation and hygienic practices
417505 nothing you do ever goes away and nothing you do ever escapes notice
417506 we are here today to share our views on one of the critical success factors in the actualisation of my governments vision of a greater akwa ibom one of these happens to be the thrust of this public lecture the issue of unity
417507 the second impetus to our resolve to pursue akwa ibom unity project is the noble history behind the creation of the state which we now commemorate
417508 akup is beyond mere advocacy it is all about complete unity embedded further in the principle of equality of akwa ibom people
417509 akwa ibom unity project is a philosophical issue of the current administration whereby every akwa ibom person irrespective of tribe age and sex will be evolved in the enterprise of akwa ibom
417510 i almost fought with an ibibio man when he mimicked my dialect and later treated me disdainfully
417511 during the last electioneering period i voted for an ibibio man for marriage i want to marry an ibibio man not annang or oron person
417512 the principle of equality of akwa ibom person will bring about total unity where every akwa ibom man has access to the blessing and placement of akwa ibom interest
417513 economic unity was not comprehended in the past and that is why governor akpabio is doing now by ensuring economic unity in order to sustain political unity
417514 i therefore implore every akwa ibom man woman and child to take the unity issue seriously and be ready to shirk past orientation and uphold the new in which we must all see ourselves as akwa ibom people and not as ibibio annang and oron in all our dealings with one another
417515 for being equitable by the return of short changed political constituencies through the recommendations of adjustments corrections and additional constituencies
417516 we believe that the time has come for this country to turn a new page where the benign neglect of pre selected portions of the entity is no longer the order of the day in order to check this unmitigated calamity of gully erosion in the south east we urge you mr president to declare the south east an ecological disaster zone
417517 there is absolutely nothing to write home about the federal roads in the south east
417518 it vibrates and sways indiscriminately no one can fathom the calamity which the indefinite over usage of this obsolete bridge portends
417519 to see that the second niger bridge project is kick started
417520 there is no doubt in any quarters whatsoever that a second niger bridge apart from guaranteeing the safety of travelers across the river niger will generally promote the economic growth of nigeria as a whole
417521 the entire south east has only four power transformation stations which are always completely over loaded
417522 these transformer stations do not supply up to 15 per cent of the energy need of the region

417534 it was my first earthquake i was 14 floors up and doing an interview when i could feel the building start to sway i looked out over la and the whole place was shaking
417535 it was a strange feeling when it kicked off i felt a bit sea sick and it made my legs go weird
417536 i didnt know if i should run for the door or just keep staring out the window looking back if the tower block had come down that would have been it for me i dont want to be a part of that again in a hurry
417537 it was getting pretty crowded in our ellicott city house
417538 here we have six acres for our soccer field and basketball court
417539 you enter by the back sliding door at the swimming pool who puts a swimming pool by the front door

417541 i have a feeling that one of our children will get married here
417542 a lot of what i did today were lessons i learned from her
417543 he played with a lot of emotion this week its been a very very rough week for him
417544 hes kept his focus and played baseball and i think its been a good release for him
417545 he has three plus pitches and he had good command of them all
417546 he pounded the strike zone and made us chase hes definitely one of the better pitchers weve faced all year
417547 hopefully well get the offense going to have the chance to give the guys at the back end of the bullpen some days off
417548 if youre a songwriter if you really mean business its inevitable youre gonna arrive at the place where you just want to pare it back and do something primitive
417549 its no secret that i grew up around records that are benchmarks for everybody but if dad wasnt in the picture people might say this kind of reminds them of paul simons rhymin simon or bruce springsteens nebraska im aware of the inevitable comparisons but i also think in the same breath he doesnt own acoustic music a lot of people have played acoustic guitar before and after im just being led by the music like everybody else
417550 the second you walked out the door it was everywhere do most kids have people crash their bar mitzvah
417551 it gets shaken out of you at some point or youre supposed to get a real vocation but i never considered anything else thats how large it looms in my life my approach has always been that its nothing but a thrill and nothing that i can stop anyhow
417552 i stretched out as much as possible made them a little sneaky so they stick around for a while
417553 he has an ability to figure out what the force is
417554 he said to me early on theres nobody youre gonna have come play on this record thats gonna make it any better youre gonna make it good and thats it his best ability is to share with you when he is moved by the music it sounds very primitive but music is primitive it either reverberates in your soul and your heart or it doesnt and no amount of knob twiddling is gonna make it any more moving
417555 i dont want it to be heavy handed i want it just to weave seamlesly through your imagination and that has to do with the shape of words and comes probably more from literature and poetry and folk music than listening to rock and roll
417556 im confused why people are so hung up on originality either youre born original or youre not sitting around with your friends at art college brewing up ways to be different is in my mind a waste of time im a huge fan of tradition i like when i get to see people working hard and working to the values of music as a real craft
417557 very few people are just tapped for something unexplained the rest of us have to apply ourselves
417558 i work my tail off i weed out a lot and i sweat it but theres no bigger thrill than when i hit the mark
417559 ringo starr and his all starr band at fantasy springs
417560 i dont think its the time that we should be accelerating our refugee efforts now is the time that we should be calling on the refugees from iraq to go home

417586 if language is to be of any use to us then we ought to try and preserve the meaning of words and god historically has not meant the laws of nature
417587 hawking is actually our ally theologically because he tells us that the notion of a finite universe as the creation of god can be sustained whether carisoprodol medicine beginning point
417588 the more the universe seems comprehensible the more it also seems pointless
417589 i dont think that by studying science you 1 mg propecia finasteride to conclude that there must be a god obfuscate a christian coyne believes in the universe as in some sense a creation of god hence he says god must be reflected in that universe so far most of those in the science religion field have been working within a christian context but there is growing concern to bring into the dialog people from other faith traditions up until the eighteenth century most of those in europe studying science were indeed men deep religious faith many of them formally schooled in theology the courses run the spectrum from specifically historical courses to those dealing with the interface between evolution and religion genetics and religion ecology and religion cosmology and religion there are now a dozen centers around the world devoted to this dialog not until the eighteenth century do we see a fundamental break between science and religion obfuscate faith and reason

417593 the v10 pocket projector has achieved significant interest amongst some of australias largest retailers and we are discussing commercial arrangements with retailers now we expect sales of the pocket projector to be high particularly as we approach the christmas period there is nothing like the pocket projector on the market today it is a true hybrid product that can be used for both business and leisure given the success of devices such as the iphone we expect the projector will fit well into this market

417600 we are focusing on an event where barbeque pork sandwiches were eaten there is no evidence at this time to relate these illnesses to food served by a restaurant or licensed caterer
417601 twenty eight have indicated they fell ill after consuming a barbeque pork sandwich including the 5 confirmed cases with the individuals becoming ill sometime between july 18 and july 26 the food preparation process may have contributed to the contamination because there have been no other related e coli cases in the region officials are focusing on this one time event the investigation continues

417606 were going to sign the employee free choice act into law because if a majority of workers want a union they should get one
417607 if you try to exercise your rights you do that at the peril of your job
417608 under the wal mart regime exercising a democratic right of self organizing is an act of courage
417609 under the employee free choice act itll be an act of democracy
417610 there needs to be a fair and equitable way to do this
417611 we need labor law reform in our country and this is our version
417612 we did a survey of a quarter of the properties and you could count on one hand the number that have actually been remediated

417616 there is no other viable resource to make up this 65 million deficit
417617 i think its disgraceful for city employees to get laid off because of a deficit the mayor helped create by mishandling city funds and squandering money trying to cover up his personal misconduct
417618 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
417619 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
417620 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
417621 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
417622 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
417623 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
417624 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
417625 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
417626 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out

417640 there was a dozen ideas proffered how to trigger a war the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and the next time one of our boats goes through the straits of hormuz start a shoot up might cost some lives and it was rejected because you cant have americans killing americans but thats the kind the level of stuff we are talking about provocation but that was rejected
417641 we now brought home all five of the combat brigades and the three marine units that were sent to iraq as part of the surge the last of these surge brigades returned home this month and later this year general petraeus will present me his recommendations on future troop levels including further reductions in our combat forces as conditions permit
417642 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
417643 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
417644 mr karadzic you are charged with one count of genocide under article 4 of the statute of the international tribunal with one count of complicity in genocide under article 4 of the statute with five counts of crimes against humanity under article 5 of the statute and with four counts of war crimes under articles 2 and 3 of the statute
417645 i have to say this is a question of life and death if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets there is no capital punishment i am wondering if his arm is long enough to reach me even here
417646 the current food crisis which is true in many many countries and the poorer you are the more affected you are by that is affecting also the fight against aids and we have the paradoxical situation that some people have access to pretty expensive and sophisticated drugs but have no food to eat nothing to eat or dont have the money to take the bus to go to the medical center and have no job
417647 through this analysis we also hope to be able to answer a question that goes beyond just finding water ice but is this a habitable zone on mars habitable zone meaning that we have periodic liquid water not today but over time and we have the materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms it will be for a future mission to find if anybodys home in this environment

417661 bipv makes a building highly energy efficient and reduces carbon emissions while ensuring basic functions of standard building elements such as water tightness light transmittance and thermal insulation
417662 the cost of an installed bipv system can vary from 12 20 per watt peak or even higher depending upon the complexities of installation or type of solar modules the payback will significantly depend upon the local utilitys willingness to buy the green energy at a preferential feed in tariff the rate at which the power utility buys the power from the producer this is what drives the urban pv market the world over and we envisage that it is going to happen in india as well in the years ahead
417663 we were given an estimate that we were paying about rs 6 lakh more for all the bipv paraphernalia which was okay because we would be paying far less for our electricity and recovering the cost in a few years
417664 there is a benefit of rs 7 per kilowatt hour to the residents
417665 we must realise that switching to solar is not just about payback it is also about taking that all important first step towards securing your own energy source and about making a green choice

417694 theres no evidence that comcast was trying to suppress a political view or favor one of its own services by all appearances the companys policies were motivated by nothing more than making sure a tiny percentage of bandwidth hogs didnt slow down internet traffic for everyone else on the network giving the government more say in network management by contrast introduces all kinds of potential for political mischief net neutrality is a slippery slope toward interventions of all kinds not merely over access but ultimately over content
417695 because the only thing net neutrality will preserve is mediocrity via the lack of competition with net neutrality there will be no new competition and no incentives for build outs bandwidth speeds will stagnate and new services will wither from bandwidth starvation

417706 die tatsache dass das barometer in den vergangenen zwei quartalen trotz weiterer negativschlagzeilen nur moderat gesunken ist deutet auf eine gewisse reife der anleger hin und zeigt dass die j ngsten turbulenzen eine nicht allzu gro e verunsicherung hervorgerufen haben
417707 they made a bid and we didnt accept it but phil gartside bolton chairman got in contact and asked whether we could do a straight swap
417708 the offer is with them now so that is where we are with it
417709 i dont know because ive asked phil gartside bolton chairman and hes not aware of it and im not aware of it i presume it is our kevin davies

417712 ramos called andrei and explained his vision of football and the future of andrei in his team
417713 hes not in a good enough state to take his place in the team
417714 he can make some decisions about his lifestyle and some of his off field things to sort them out
417715 hes had two weeks to sort it out and he hasnt sorted it out yet
417716 if he does there could be a future if he doesnt hell stay exactly where he is now
417717 as a professional footballer you have obligations to your team mates

417720 was i disappointed by his attitude not at all i found him to be very serious and focused
417721 he wanted to leave chelsea i am certain of that although it created a lot of anxiety for him and in fact he remained because of family matters
417722 he stayed for his father who he is extremely close to and for his whole environment therefore he was unable to create that split that they expected and we were hoping for
417723 inter coach jose mourinho did hope for this move but we knew it was going to be difficult
417724 with our central location and the price of fuel i can see how a lot of business aircraft will be based there

417727 kevin i believe in the next 24 to 48 hours will be signing a new deal to put another year on to his contract hopefully
417728 i think that his style is the more carries he gets the better he becomes and i think that still is the case and being lighter he might be able to break some longer runs thats what im hoping for

417731 the guideline has been strengthened and is likely to result in many more offences committed by adult offenders crossing the custody threshold

417734 when i arrived at x factor sharon and louis made it very clear they didnt think i should be there by the end of the series sharon made it public she didnt like me
417735 it was very hard because i was excited to be on the show and had so much new stuff to learn it was interesting that they kind of went out of their way to make it as difficult for me as possible
417736 i think it forced simon and i to be better friends as i was getting attacked so much from the other side of the judging panel
417737 in times of financial instability brands go for top quality they want to sell dreams there is much more punch with a girl like linda than a beautiful face from ukraine
417738 over the past four or five years weve seen an influx of beautiful but bland girls from eastern europe today fashion brands are looking to spice things up with strong personalities and iconic women
417739 our agency looked after every single one of the supermodels and we werent affected at all in fact they were doing better than ever these models get people shopping
417740 they were elevated to such a status that still customers have an instant relationship with them
417741 this lawsuit is ridiculous and riddled with lie upon lie from verne troyer and his camp
417742 it is in our opinion a transparent attempt to secure as much publicity as he can from his less than average career in the wake of his most recent failure in the love guru
417743 the only abuse that ever occurred in their household was that of emotional abuse inflicted upon ranae and her dog lacy on the occasions when he hit ranae and her dog with his reaching sticks or kicked them when having one of his drunken rages
417744 this alleged abuse certainly has not seemed to affect his recent round of interviews or his golf swing over the weekend is this not the same man who is renown as a professional stuntman in all his movies
417745 at the moment i dont deserve the top spot i am not in the best shape i am not at my highest level
417746 so it will take time for me to get better the number one spot doesnt matter i want to be healthy i want to improve i want to play tennis i dont really think about number one or whatever happens if its going to happen it will happen
417747 i was hitting the ball well but then i just got exhausted completely lost my concentration
417748 the longer the play went i felt worse and worse

417754 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party

417759 i had to clear one third of the farm 6 600 trees last year and 80 per cent of my tree nursery
417760 i didnt know whether i would be a fruit grower any more at the end of the year
417761 without streptomycin we would certainly have been in the same position as last year
417762 we will absolutely need to use streptomycin in the next years until more efficient alternatives are found
417763 even better are species which are resistant to fire blight
417764 the winners include the fruit growers because they get their problem under control
417765 on the losers side are the beekeepers because it cannot be ruled out that honey becomes contaminated with streptomycin and cannot be sold
417766 we think its because people have understood that its an emergency situation when this remedy is needed

417785 we cannot hide the fact that we need new players at everton
417786 everybody knows it i know it the players know it
417787 it is okay getting fit but you have got to be able to play better at the moment there is not enough competition for the players to realise that if they play poorly they will not be selected
417788 whilst i can fully understand the sense of frustration being felt by our supporters in the wake of what some perceive to be a moratorium with regard to the signing of new players i feel it is important to make a few points
417789 our attempts to complete the signings of players we believe will improve the quality of our first team squad continues on an hourly basis
417790 we have had a budget for incoming transfers since the start of the summer and that budget is in no way reliant or dependent upon either the proposed relocation of the club to kirkby or the sale of current players
417791 indeed any proceeds from outgoing transfers will you can rest assured be added to the existing budget to strengthen our managers hand as he seeks to enter the transfer market
417792 david and myself have been trying throughout the close season to sign those players whom he believes will help to improve the squad which achieved so much during the last campaign
417793 like everyone connected with everton football club i am desperately keen to see the arrival at goodison park of those players our manager would like to see in a blue shirt come next season
417794 i appreciate that waiting can be hard and that patience is invariably in short supply but we do expect to make signings before the opening of the new premier league season
417795 when you have many young players you cannot keep them all
417796 the most important thing is that you develop them as a player and they have a big career
417797 at some stage you have to consider the quality of the player and what is in front of him
417798 at the time the players in front of bentley like ljungberg and robert pires were better than him
417799 he wanted to play more central in the dennis bergkamp role and i felt at the time he was not ready he would be more ready today
417800 there comes a moment when a player has to play to develop when you feel that you have to make a decision to let him go or keep him
417801 the fact that bentley is now a national team player proves it was the right decision
417802 we deserve praise because we were not stupid and keep the player in the reserves
417803 at youth level you are working 90 for other clubs some players who are just a little bit short for you go somewhere else but you have an influence on their development
417804 when you have an academy of our quality not every player can make it
417805 im extremely disappointed that having returned to training i now have to undergo further surgery
417806 however im confident that i can recover from this setback sooner rather than later
417807 i was looking forward to joining the new players who have been added to the squad but i will now focus on my rehabilitation after surgery and look forward to returning as soon as possible
417808 there is no proper mechanism to ensure stipulated use of the detonators which may have gone to unwarranted hands through a possible black sheep among contractors
417809 we are already in the process of making a list of dealers from whom the detonators could have been procured
417810 i havent received any official information on the use of recl detonators recovered from the surat bombs
417811 we want to find out how they reached the terrorists as of now there is no information about whether the detonators were purchased or stolen
417812 as many as 1 500 detonators are usually packed in a single carton on which the batch number is properly written the manufacturing companies maintain a record of the batch numbers of cartons supplied to the dealers
417813 there is anger among people over the death of two children in the town most people have kept their establishments closed following a call given by the gondwana republican party and the samajwadi party
417814 the hostel management says that the boys died because of a fall in the toilet but the people suspect some foul play we are however investigating the matter security all over the town mainly around the ashram and the hostel run by it has been beefed up to avoid any untoward incident
417815 only the parents and the guardians interested to see their children or who want to take them back are being allowed entry inside the premises no untoward incident has been reported since morning

418202 on july 26 1970 carl bernard hampton one of black americas most articulate courageous and heroic young leaders was ruthlessly slain by the houston police departments criminal intelligence division at the age of 21 carl was a tireless organizer who worked day and night armed with determination to see his people free from the oppression exploitation and degradation by a racist and corrupt system bent on the destruction of blacks and people of color he rallied people around the issue of police brutality and murder speaking with much power and authority he was able to capture the hearts and minds of the people and therefore their respect and admiration
418203 maybe you had to die for what you stood for you were an intelligent young man and devoted to your people so i shall close carl and hope you didnt die for no reason i shall close with my tear stained eyes for i loved you so good night carl hampton although i just met you one time good night your 30 minute friend and brother although you didnt know my name but you knew my face goodbye

418208 i put him into my pickup truck and took all his panther identification off him and admitted him to the hospital in my husbands name so they would treat him but carl was in and out of consciousness and i am not sure he was even alive when i got him to the hospital i loved him so much
418209 i cant believe they murdered him he was so important he loved all people and i have never forgotten him
418210 the legacy of carl hampton is seriously important because so much history has been buried
418211 this needs to be brought out we dont need a monument or a symbol but some serious work in the community as we were gathering tonight a man was in the dumpster looking for a meal across the street from where carl was shot i saw that people are camping and living in the empty lot the brother gave his life so that all could have a place to stay and clothes on their backs and good food to eat the very issues that carl struggled around and gave his life for still need addressing this is a human struggle and carl is a legacy of that struggle we want to keep this struggle alive
418212 the thing that dragged me into the party was members dedication to the people
418213 their love just grabbed me they would go without in order to serve the people and i had to be a part of that

418268 the portiuncula was an old church dedicated to the virgin mother of god which was abandoned francis had great devotion to the queen of the world and when he saw that the church was deserted he began to live there constantly in order to repair it he heard that the angels often visited it so that it was called saint mary of the angels and he decided to stay there permanently out of reverence for the angels and love for the mother of christ he loved this spot more than any other in the world it was here he began his religious life in a very small way it is here he came to a happy end when he was dying he commended this spot above all others to the friars because it was most dear to the blessed virgin this was the place where saint francis founded his order by divine inspiration and it was divine providence which led him to repair three churches before he founded the order and began to preach the gospel this meant that he progressed from material things to more spiritual achievements from lesser to greater in due order and it gave a prophetic indication of what he would accomplish later as he was living there by the church of our lady francis prayed to her who had conceived the word full of grace and truth begging her insistently and with tears to become his advocate then he was granted the true spirit of the gospel by the intercession of the mother of mercy and he brought it to fruition he embraced the mother of our lord jesus with indescribable love because as he said it was she who made the lord of majesty our brother and through her we found mercy after christ he put all his trust in her and took her as his patroness for himself and his friars
418269 the portiuncula indulgence is the first plenary indulgence that was ever granted in the church there were indeed indulgences at all times but they were only partial and only a partial remission of the temporal punishments could be obtained by them but as already remarked he who gains the portiuncula indulgence is freed from all temporal punishments and becomes as pure as after holy baptism this was also the reason why pope honorius was astonished when st francis petitioned for the confirmation of this indulgence for such an indulgence up to that time bad been entirely unknown it was only after he had come to the conviction that jesus christ himself wished it that he granted the petition of the saint and confirmed the indulgence

418301 from the communitys point of view if we have any compassion for those whose mileage is showing up but their economic areas meet the criteria this to me spiritually physically and emotionally its a significant benefit to those people rather than having to go to an institutionalized nursing home
418302 the bottom line is we can keep those people out of nursing homes which is a very highly expensive cost money wise and quality of life wise as a social contract to the people who live in the united states

418330 we had some new people come into the production and we went to new countries and theres an energy and an enthusiasm that comes to our show and keeps it fresh
418331 one of the redeeming things about the amazing race that keeps it alive and fresh is were able to go and establish a new stage in every season in different countries were not going to a studio where we know its going to be 69 degrees and we know were going to be working with professional people who always work that soundstage
418332 were going to new countries working with new people and when they get caught up in the enthusiasm of race it keeps it fresh for all of us their enthusiasm reminds us that were working on something incredibly special they bring something to it themselves because theyre looking at it from a totally different perspective
418333 in the viewers mind because the show rolls out once a week theyve made the assumption that were taking a week to go and set up and get everything together people in the industry understand that but the audience is only starting to get that now whats involved for us as a production to stay ahead of them and how challenging that is
418334 people in the industry know what its like to get 30 to 40 cameras through customs and signing equipment in and out every bit down to the smallest microphone has to be documented in and out of countries they understand that taking one trip to a country is something but if youre doing it every other day and they have to negotiate in and out of airports every single leg lights tripods microphones that have to make it the show has to go on
418335 it is without a doubt the most complicated show physically that ive ever been a part of because theres no way to really control it when its under way you have to roll with it there are times when i am literally racing to the mat in one direction while theyre coming toward me from the other
418336 its incredibly difficult to get accurate information sometimes to know exactly where they are we make calculations about where they should be but when youre maybe in india and theres a protest on the street or theres a march you didnt know was going to be happening that day things happen
418337 there have been races on television since television began and most are about elite racers most racers on tv are racers that are the best at what they do what is so different about our race is that we have people who are certainly not extraordinary in their ability to race they are generally not fit there are beer bellies tall short black white some have competed with one leg some have had recent knee surgery they are not your extraordinary racers
418338 until the amazing race came along i dont think wed ever seen ordinary people in extraordinary situations and not a fly by night setup this is a monumental thing were doing when we set out i remember we all took a breath after the first leg of the first race and we all said oh my god what did we just unleash and can we keep this going speaking for myself it was a little overwhelming
418339 i learned a long time ago not to judge what people like because im certainly not an expert the more i learn about television the more i realize i dont know
418340 our job as television producers and television makers is to create something to watch and entertain them i feel lucky that what we make does appeal to people and its something that i feel proud of thats a privilege its a privilege to work on something that you actually really believe in and you can sell without any reservation at all i love selling this show i love the reaction i get from people
418341 no matter where im going what i pack is different combinations
418342 phil has an exciting and colourful life story and is a fantastic role model for young people he is a great supporter and a wonderful ambassador for new zealand abroad and we are delighted to welcome him to the capital city

418375 eine solche haltung ist aber nicht ungew hnlich sondern in fast jedem land blich in einem land wie china bleibt es eine besondere gratwanderung
418376 china erlaubt mehr als es zugesagt hat es erm glicht auch den freien zugang zu themen die nichts mit olympia zu tun haben
418377 aber mit der aufhebung ist noch nicht der standard von internationaler meinungsfreiheit erreicht
418378 der vorgang zeigt dass die chinesische regierung nicht vollkommen unempfindlich auf druck reagiert
418379 die bremsen waren ein bisschen warm gelaufen das kann immer mal vorkommen besonders bei den hohen sommertemperaturen die wir hatten

418381 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder after taking a few different exams and mris this morning the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder there are so many mixed feelings this is something that needs a lot of time to heal which hurts me to say that i have to miss the olympics
418382 when we left for the olympics i had the results for all the athletes except these two
418383 if there is the tiniest doubt about them they will not compete
418384 it will also be the toughest to make the semis the toughest to make the finals and the toughest to win
418385 whether that results in world records all the time or whether the world records will come in the finals i think were going to have to wait and see what happens

418387 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
418388 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
418389 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards

418391 transsexuals who have had a sex change from male to female can compete in womens events in the olympics as long they wait two years after the operation
418392 the postmortem revealed she had male genitalia although this did not prove that she was a man as she was also found to have both male and female chromosomes a genetic condition known as
418393 all our work is in vain we have learned nothing
418394 oh we have come a long way and we have learned a lot
418395 the difference between the rich and the poor is what they do in their spare time
418396 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
418397 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
418398 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
418399 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
418400 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
418401 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
418402 i disagree i only wish there was a way to explain why this article is wrong
418403 the quality of the etchings is superb anyone who thinks of a print simply as a reproductive work will be amazed when they see these prints it is like looking over the shoulder of a master
418404 the officers never stepped on the gas to try and pursue
418405 what help can he give me what help is he talking about
418406 dont make a statement and have a press conference then try to call everybody and say oh we want to work with you
418407 we reached out because this isnt a chicago problem this is everyones problem
418408 the governor wasnt going to sit on the sidelines and not act
418409 you gotta enact domestic legislation because we are obligated by a treaty
418410 provide an opinion as to whether there were more similarities than differences
418411 applying satava here it is clear that the image of a mother mountain lion perched on a rock with a kitten in her mouth is an idea
418412 the common heritage of humankind and no artist may use copyright law to prevent others from depicting it
418413 appellants therefore may place no reliance upon any similarity in expression resulting from the physiognomy of dinosaurs
418414 was a carnivore and is commonly pictured with its mouth open
418415 no more than his original contribution to ideas already in the pubic domain
418416 exist in nature and they are common to all of us
418417 some of what might appear in a natural living mountain lion
418418 the lighting the scene the entire scene the angle and because of making those choices his choice of film and lens
418419 made many judgments that required both skill and technical know how those judgments may have even involved creativity as that word is commonly used
418420 in a manner of speaking it took creative judgments to decide how best to depict the three dimensional vehicle in a two dimensional display
418421 the issue of copyrightability is typically resolved by a motion for summary judgment
418422 c opyright protection subsists in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression now known or later developed from which they can be perceived reproduced or otherwise communicated either directly or with the aid of a machine or device
418423 to qualify for copyright protection a work must be original to the author
418424 original means only that the work was independently created by the author and possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity
418425 to be sure the requisite level of creativity is extremely low even a slight amount will suffice the vast majority of works make the grade quite easily as they possess some creative spark no matter how crude humble or obvious it might be
418426 t he presumption is not absolute possession of a registration certificate creates a rebuttable presumption that the work in question is copyrightable
418427 t he illustrations were intended to be as accurate as possible in reproducing the parts shown in the photographs on which they were based a form of slavish copying that is the antithesis of originality
418428 plaintiffs spindle bearing was drawn with the express intention of duplicating on paper the appearance of an actual spindle bearing
418429 t here is no uniform test to determine the copyrightability of photographs
418430 t he elements that combine to satisfy feists minimal spark of creativity standard will necessarily vary depending on the photographers creative choices
418431 t he cumulative impact of these technical and artistic choices becomes manifest in renowned portraits such as oscar wilde 18 the measure or originality becomes more difficult to gauge as one moves from sublime expression to simple reproduction
418432 while lindners works may not be as creative as a portrait by dianne arbus they show artistic judgment and therefore meet the feist standard
418433 what makes plaintiffs photographs original is the totality of the precise lighting selection angle of the camera lens and filter selection
418434 p laintiff cannot prevent others from photographing the same frames or using the same lighting techniques and blue sky reflection in the mirrors p ractically the plaintiffs works are only protected from verbatim copying
418435 w hile plaintiff is no doubt a skilled artist capable of making jewelry with a certain aesthetic appeal she has failed to show what copyrightable features she has added to her work to separate it from ordinary public domain barbed wire
418436 t he fact remains that for all her aesthetic choices the final arrangement of the elements in her jewelry still corresponds to the arrangement of public domain barbed wire
418437 old photostat copies from the 20s and 30s are shiny like that so this is why youd think this is not a real document

418442 todays global climate of insecurity and terrorism requires an in depth independent analysis of stability around the world

418452 attempt to characterize the debate about same sex marriage as a god versus gays battle is grounded on mistaken or at least carelessly considered legal assumptions indeed in important respects protecting the right of gay men and lesbians to marry may help to reaffirm and reinforce religious freedom in our legal system far more than it will interfere with the free exercise of religion
418453 to accommodate those religious communities by exempting them from requirements in the law that unreasonably interfere with the practice of their faith
418454 both the right to marry and the right to exercise ones religion free from government interference are basic autonomy rights we protect these rights because they involve important self defining decisions that belong as of right to individuals rather than the state
418455 argument for respecting other self defining decisions that are intrinsic to personal identity
418456 religious liberty and the justification for religious accommodations are based on principles of substantive and functional liberty and equality

418635 the cas has registered an appeal from fc barcelona against the decision made by the single judge of the fifa players status committee regarding the release of players for the olympic games
418636 this appeal will be handled together with the appeals filed by fc schalke 04 and werder bremen against the same fifa decision
418637 the cas will deliver its final ruling on or before 6 august 2008
418638 the judge determined that the international match calendar is not of relevance in establishing whether clubs are obliged to release players for the mens olympic football tournament
418639 taking part in the olympic games is a unique opportunity for all athletes of any sporting discipline
418640 it would not be justifiable to prevent any player younger than 23 from participating in such an event if his representative team had qualified
418641 from the beginning ive said that i want to play for my national team and ive never had problems until now
418642 if i get there and the cas says i have to come back then i will come back
418643 for the moment i want to be with my national team and my team mates
418644 we understand that it will be very difficult to retain the player and for him to take part in our tour of the united states
418645 the normal thing will be for him to now go to join argentina but if the cas makes a decision in our favour then he will have to come back
418646 i am a new vegan and have literally been attacked in all sorts of verbal arguments everything from no wonder you look sick which i dont to why dont you care about babies you have given me so much ammo so that i dont have to resort to arguments but i have a question it is overwhelming all of the information i have learned about animal suffering and the humans that suffer along that are involved in the killing and processing of animals how do you deal with that awareness i lived in misinformation for so long or maybe it was denial and now that i know i have a very hard time dealing with it i feel anxious or depressed and try to stretch myself to do every little thing i could possibly do to reduce my impact or tell someone about it
418647 today i listened in incredible pain to your podcast on fishing bycatch as an avid scuba diver who has spent many hours underwater sharing the wonderful ocean with beautiful marine species i cannot tell you how excruciatingly depressing it was for me to hear you quote the agonising facts and figures on over fishing bycatch killings and atrocious effects that the fishing industry is having on the wonderful lives below the surface nothing on your podcast was new to me what really pained was to realise what little difference i as an individual and a few thousands like me can make to this dismal situation i truly feel that what i do what you do what many like us try to do has hardly any true effect on the atrocious actions that the fishing industry and governments carry though every day i feel like we are as small flea trying to shift an elephant how do you do it colleen where do you get the energy to continue fighting on every day dont you get depressed and feel like giving up because you feel that your efforts hardly make a difference i certainly feel like that i will of course continue with my efforts every single day but i have resigned myself to think that whatever i chose to do the world around me will continue to charge ahead with its destruction
418648 right now sorrow for the creatures who endure unthinkable suffering is large for me but i am grateful for the sorrow which is real and is part of awakening further to life

418660 if youre going to be an interpreter you have to follow the code
418661 deaf people depend on you to follow that code they depend on you to be confidential and they depend on you to offer no opinion you are only a voice you are not there to be anything more than that its a lot of responsibility
418662 the responsibility is greater the mass is abstract translating the abstract to the concrete can be difficult i practice more
418663 interpreters are not to teach but we do have the flexibility to take a word and translate it and interpret it to its true meaning
418664 if i gave you a song to interpret you would spend hours memorizing it word for word
418665 then you would spend a lot of time listening to it and thinking whats the rhythm what does it mean what does the writer want and what is it youre hearing in it so with music you have poetic license and the song becomes more visually beautiful
418666 if i read you the words to a song they would mean one thing but when you hear the voice put into those notes it becomes a whole different experience what a singer does with his voice or his body movement we interpreters can do by expanding signs by creating a sign by creating a more visual picture
418667 beginning when mary ann was around 10 years old she said the girls would go to a family gathering and audrey would constantly ask what other people were saying
418668 it wasnt that she was averse to teaching me sign
418669 you just didnt sign in public in those days none of the deaf would sign in public and most of them didnt sign in school because they were punished if they did
418670 i saw the separation between my friend as a deaf person and a family of hearing i saw the pain on both sides i saw how she would go to confession and have to write her sins down on a piece of paper and slide them under to the priest
418671 the deaf person would follow along with the english but they would miss the homily
418672 im sitting in the pew and im thinking i didnt see that he said it a second time and again i thought thats not what hes asking me to do ive only had one and a half semesters the third time he said to the deaf i have to sit down i need a 10 or 15 minute break i found myself walking up past the deaf getting to the spot where he was and starting to interpret i had no idea how tired the mind gets when youre interpreting
418673 if i finger spelled a word too much afterwards they let me know what the sign for it was father must have seen something in me and from that time on he mentored me to become an interpreter
418674 mary anns vast experiences with interpreting in the catholic church be it for mass lecturers or workshops make her truly one of a kind she signs so effortlessly using facial and body movements that fit the tone of the words whether graceful stern angry pleasant or happy
418675 an excellent interpreter i am able to follow her clearly i know fr joe bruce is very pleased having her around while the deafies attend his church
418676 with sign language interpreting at masses i see more and more deaf people attending mass and becoming more active in their catholic faith
418677 there are a number of cases around the country where deaf people are held in jail and not provided with any means to communicate with people on the outside theyre lost they get lost
418678 its something thats well known in the deaf community something people are afraid of happening to them

418682 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
418683 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
418684 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
418685 we make sure that every film we show has at least one showing that is subtitled
418686 as a community venue it is crucial we make every resource available to everyone and this latest addition to the cinema helps to do that
418687 having four children myself i know how expensive a trip to the cinema can be
418688 thats why when we set the cinema prices we were determined to keep them as low as possible
418689 going to the cinema is one of lifes greatest pleasures and we want to make sure that no one misses out simply because of the price
418690 not only are we affordable but we make sure that we book the best movies from release date
418691 so expect to see the customs house hosting films like high school musical 3 batman the mummy 3 and the brand new star wars animated film

418693 i personally dont believe the state would be willing to give up that resource
418694 this is not something thats going to happen next fall
418695 i see no scenario where expanding outreach programs isnt part of it

418714 mccain dressed informally and wearing his navy cap strode purposefully across the stage and spoke earnestly without notes he shared his vision to reduce dependency on foreign oil in one way by modeling use of nuclear energy after that of the french who recycle their nuclear waste he told an emotional patriotic story from his own years as a pow mccain appealed to the veterans out front saying that he hated war and he knew how to win it without on the job training just before a surprise downpour he personally greeted each of the military people in the reserved section at spots along his route he took special time to lean down and place a hand on a veterans shoulder for a thank you and a heart to heart chat

418760 a cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast
418761 each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast from 1st on up
418762 with access to two domain spells at a given spell level a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot if a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell slot
418763 the cleric can lose any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower
418764 this obviously refers to the spell in a domain list definition
418765 spells cast through the domain spell slot which are from the healing domain
418766 convert prepared divine spells into any spell from that domain
418767 based on earlier reasoning we would be able to conclude that it is referring to the slot definition and allow rsops empower maximize healing without hesitation
418768 a spell from one of your nondomain spell slots even if the spell also happens to appear on your domain list
418769 you can only empower maximize your domain spells not every spell you cast from the healing domain

418873 i do not know if the reason he took money in manchester was that some of them were the manchester investors in the casino project in my constituency
418874 they had 6 people at first and later on 2 of them went to the table behind them
418875 but no one says how fast reforms need to be
418876 theres been players from the stronger counties and they decide not to come because they have an opportunity to win an all ireland medal i wouldnt be surprised if theres not 20 players here in the next two years
418877 its not a flood of players a flood of players are going to england to play soccer a flood of players are playing rugby union thats a flood
418878 its not a huge drama at the moment theres 10 players here but in two to three years time there could be 30 plus here
418879 the problem is were taking the best players from ireland and thats going to affect the game there in the future that doesnt sit too pretty with me the last thing i want to do is to see the gaa gaelic athletic association or the game itself suffer
418880 two or three times a day there are stories about it back home asking what the gaa is going to do about it
418881 when the teacher sneezes the whole class catches a cold
418882 well maybe i just need an attitude adjustment maybe this situation really hasnt yet reached critical mass ill leave it to the next generation to fix
418883 one of a teachers most important tasks is to model appropriate behavior
418884 i know that you want to fuck why else did you call me down here in such a state unless you wanted me to fuck you ha
418885 hold on lets keep it a secret what happened between us is a mistake
418886 beg me slut you want my cock you fucking whore
418887 listen you cunt from now you will have to fuck and suck me any time i want if you dont the n your husband will be the first to know about it you are very tasty bitch and were gonna have a lot of fucking

418891 i new a teacher who taught fifth grade for 38 years one day i asked her how she manged to stay inspired
418892 this is my 38th year teaching 5th grade but for these students its the first time around
418893 teenage apathy serves as a new roadblock to learning their refusal to nurture curiosity about anything school related seems peculiar to secondary students
418894 good readers dont disguise or ignore their confusion they acknowledge it so they can eliminate it
418895 i didnt know that if students generated their own questions not only would they remeber the information beter they would be more interested in the reading
418896 with direct explicit instruction that demonstrates what good readers do struggling readers can be taught how to comprehend text better
418897 one strategy doesnt work all the time purpose and task demand that strategies be flexible and adaptable i decide what strategies to use and how i will use them in order to understand what i am reading i consciously think about and react to the situation at hand each text is different in order to read well i must use a variety of strategies
418898 purpose and task demand that strategies be flexible and adaptable
418899 if we teach our students to inquire we will have a well of information from which to teach and our students will have a purpose for learning
418900 good readers know that in order to understand a text more deeply they must collaborate with the author searching for clues as they read and combining textual information with their background knowledge
418901 each day readers add to their store of background knowledge new experiences allow them to bring fresh meaning to text each time it is read
418902 inferences differ from opions in that inferences are steeped in evidence and saturated in personal experience inferences are logical conclusions made with the mind not the heart
418903 it is important not to appear to advocate outlandish conclusions by accepting all responses as an elementary teacher i unknowingly did this for fear of squelching childrens enthusiasm instead of drawing students closer to meaning i pulled them away from it
418904 when teachers use phrases like read between the lines make an inference draw a conclusion think harder they are not showing students how to infer they are merely telling them to infer
418905 athletes often follow these same steps when perfecting their game for example teaching my daugther to play tennis igave her encouragement and instr4uction about how to hit a proper forehand if i had begun by standing at the opposite baseline and blasting balls across the net her daughter would have given up and concluded that she wasnt a good tennis player

418960 while progress has been made in automatic face detection in images finding other objects such as mountains or tea pots which are instantly recognizable to humans has lagged
418961 we cast the image ranking problem into the task of identifying authority nodes on an inferred visual similarity graph and propose an algorithm to analyze the visual link structure that can be created among a group of images through an iterative procedure based on the pagerank computation a numerical weight is assigned to each image this measures its relative importance to the other images being considered
418962 by treating images as web documents and their similarities as probabilistic visual hyperlinks we estimate the likelihood of images visited by a user traversing through these visual hyperlinks those with more estimated visits will be ranked higher than others
418963 first by making the approach query dependent by selecting the initial set of images from search engine answers human knowledge in terms of linking relevant images to webpages is directly introduced into the system since the links on the pages are used by google for their current ranking second we implicitly rely on the intelligence of crowds the image similarity graph is generated based on the common features between images those images that capture the common themes from many of the other images are those that will have higher rank

419065 the first part of my plan is a 1 000 emergency energy rebate that could go out to families as soon as this fall this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
419066 i am proposing that we pay for this rebate by taxing the windfall profits of oil companies so we can use some of their record profits to help families pay record prices
419067 the second part of my plan is a 50 billion stimulus to help jump start job creation and help local communities that are struggling due to our economic downturn
419068 half of this stimulus will go to state governments that are facing big budget shortfalls the other half of this stimulus will be used to invest in our national infrastructure replenish the highway trust fund rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges and repair our crumbling schools
419069 we feel that it is obamas responsibility to speak out in defense not just about but in defense about his people of the historically oppressed african community
419070 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
419071 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

419077 the clearest evidence to date that pakistani intelligence officers are actively undermining american efforts to combat militants in the region
419078 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
419079 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
419080 there are probably still individuals within the isi who are ideologically sympathetic to the taleban and act on their own in ways that are not in convergence with the policies and interests of the government of pakistan
419081 we need to identify these people and weed them out
419082 there is no question of any purge in the isi
419083 the government has already stated that there are no links or evidence of isi involvement in the kabul bombing it was in the past during the soviet jihad that a few pro taleban elements had found their way in and with the change in policy have been firmly been rooted out
419084 the decision was revoked within hours apparently following intervention from the army
419085 zawahri has been killed by them several times but once again this claim is wrong this is baseless
419086 an al qaeda in iraq leader in eastern anbar province who recently split from the group
419087 al qaeda losing the sunni population is like a human being losing the ability to drink water
419088 because of masris weak personality and leadership al qaeda in iraq was weakened and split and lost the sunni population
419089 escalating hate against them by sunnis due to the useless operations that ignored the main enemy which is the head of evil the united states

419093 w ith iran the u s government will again need to keep an eye on the long term communicating with the current government but also encouraging more discussion among iranians and more contacts and interactions between iranians and americans
419094 societies and governments change the u s government has some ability to foster favourable trends in iran but these policies will take time to come to fruition
419095 appears to be on its way to becoming a nuclear power
419096 a large majority of iranians strongly believe that iran has the same right as other nations to develop nuclear energy including the construction and operation of nuclear enrichment facilities
419097 if irans facilities were to be bombed public support for any retaliation its government took would likely be widespread
419098 strong push to retaliate as c ritics of such a policy would likely choose to keep silent
419099 to finance the reconstruction of the facility and continue the current programme without major budgetary consequences
419100 probably do more to solidify public support for the regime than weaken it
419101 iranian security forces have convincingly shown that they can handle restive ethnic groups and violent opposition to iranian rule is more likely to entrench the current security and political forces than to elicit a positive change in regime policies

419117 the development of energy infrastructure is an expensive business and nawec needs the financial resources to maintain and expand its services to deserving people of the gambia
419118 eighty 80 compound have been connected to the distribution grid of the project and will be supplied with electricity generated from the wind turbine the excess energy will be sold to nawec through its grid
419119 this is because the government of the gambia is aware of the benefits of utilising all forms of renewable energy for the socio economic transformation of our country we cannot rely on the petroleum resources alone to meet our development challenges in the energy sector

419135 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded

419203 it intercepts the keystrokes records them and then just passes them on to the computer
419204 its really interesting that companies are spending an inordinate amount of money trying to protect information but theyre trying to protect it from people outside the organization
419205 i think thats appropriate because there are a lot of bad guys out there but a recent study showed 80 percent of data leakage problems actually came from within i think companies are going to have to start paying attention to sensitive data within the organization getting out i think thats a huge problem

419233 declining production from a field typically means the pressure the oil is under is falling so other fluids or gas must be pumped in to force what remains out of the ground making the work harder and more expensive the decline also ultimately leads to the point when although much of its oil may remain in place oil companies turn their back on the field as it has become too expensive to justify the work
419234 the cantarell oilfield in the shallow waters of the campeche bay is regarded in the mexican oil industry as the countrys crown jewel it is the worlds second largest oil field by production pumping about 2 2 million barrels of oil as much as every oil field in kuwait put together for that reason the news from petroleos mexicanos the state oil company that the fields production would begin to decline this year was met with dismay declining production from a field typically means the pressure the oil is under is falling so other fluids or gas must be pumped in to force what remains out of the ground making the work harder and more expensive the decline also ultimately leads to the point when although much of its oil may remain in place oil companies turn their back on the field as it has become too expensive to justify the work

419277 at the moment there are a great many people with hepatitis c who have no treatment options left and it would transform their lives if we could prevent them from developing liver failure we are looking forward to seeing the results of our upcoming trial in humans now that weve had such promising results in the trial in mice
419278 if we have positive results from the new trial we will have a potential treatment that is already available and very cheap and which should be safe enough for people to take if we are successful in hepatitis c patients we are hopeful that such treatment might benefit people with liver damage from other causes and this is something we would be keen to study further
419279 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
419280 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
419281 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
419282 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
419283 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see

419287 we showed we could block behavior in mice that resembles this increased euphoria even after the animals had been given a lot of alcohol

419291 it turns out that calmodulin is doing a similar thing sensing the calcium coming through the closest channel through one ear while the other ear listens to the calcium coming through distant channels across the cell
419292 once a local calcium ion sticks to the c lobe it seldom lets go and so the local calcium dominates
419293 now that we are learning how these drugs actually work
419294 we can contribute our new understanding of calmodulin to the design of next generation drugs with greater potency and fewer side effects

419298 an impression of the muzzle and foresight of the weapon used was discernible in the area surrounding the entry wound which suggested it had been pressed firmly against the left side of her head upon discharge

419300 the ones murders that worry me are unsolved murders cases that leave people without an answer for losses
419301 a job well done because a culprit has been found and punished
419302 it was a difficult decision to take because there was no eye witness to the murder and no smoking gun and we had to consider it very carefully
419303 although i did not know jill dando personally my cousin freddy mercury was interviewed by her back in 1986
419304 i was present with him so for this reason i feel its poignant to express together the situation of jills death and my coming to christ
419305 it is inconceivable that there were two men in gowan avenue that morning both of the same age height and general appearance both of whom had an interest in jill dando and experience in handguns
419306 we ask you to be careful about the strength of feelings there may be it will do no justice to jill dandos memory or this case were you to allow those feelings to mould together what otherwise might be a non existent case because there is in some unconscious way or another a desire to see someone pay

419309 the search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness
419310 one cannot divine nor forecast the conditions that will make happiness one only stumbles upon them
419311 we are never happy we can only remember that we were so once
419312 ask yourself whether you are happy and you cease to be so
419313 happiness is a mystery like religion and should never be rationalised

419325 o organismo internacional n o parece ter a menor pressa de considerar um caso diplomaticamente complicado j que o caso envolveria um governante em exerc cio
419326 naquele per odo mais que em qualquer outro fui levada a acreditar com grande intensidade que meu destino seria suportar mesmo aquela vida suas aberra es ele me fazia acreditar que era eu que permitia que ele mantivesse a sua suposta estabilidade emocional e me falava do papel que segundo diz eu tinha na revolu o o de ser seu objeto sexual dispon vel em car ter permanente por isso n o s me resguardei no sil ncio a que estava condenada como me vi submersa na decomposi o e corrup o do poder que ele exercia
419327 daniel ortega saavedra me violentou no ano de 1982 n o recordo ao certo o dia mas recordo muito bem tudo que aconteceu foi em meu quarto jogada sobre o tapete onde ele n o s me manuseou como de maneira agressiva e com movimentos bruscos me feriu senti muita dor e um frio intenso ele ejaculou sobre meu corpo para evitar o risco de gravidez e continuou a faz lo repetidas vezes minha boca minhas pernas e meus seios foram as reas em que se acostumou a depositar seu s men apesar do meu asco e de minha repugn ncia ele maculou meu corpo o utilizou como desejou sem se importar com o que eu pudesse sentir ou pensar o mais importante era o prazer dele minha dor n o tinha import ncia
419328 n o consegui entender porque ela exibia aquela atitude de resigna o diante da posse que seu companheiro de vida exercia sobre mim as tentativas de estabelecer um v nculo de afeto com minha m e se viram frustradas porque para mim era muito dif cil ser usada sistematicamente por daniel ortega na biblioteca da casa e em seu escrit rio e ao mesmo tempo compartilhar desse lugar de trabalho e de interc mbio entre m e e filha

419377 um risco que corremos temos que fugir disso o time deve ser determinado na defesa e carudo no ataque
419378 nesses jogos posso colocar duas piv s fortes como a grazi 1 91 m e a kelly 1 92 m mas a id ia manter as baixinhas na quadra quero ver as jogadoras altas conseguirem marc las

419380 theres no going back now were very happy with how the art style is the art teams happy the companys happy we really like this art style and were not changing it
419381 when you have 30 creatures on screen and four or five different types target prioritization is a factor you need to be able to tell those things apart fast and you cant do that when your world is gray and your creatures are gray
419382 its not that we dont like games like that but they tend to be shorter games like first person shooters that are five or six hours long
419383 i think its impossible for us to not be influenced by our other creations theres a lot of back and forth between the two games and i dont think theres anything wrong with that we look at world of warcraft and the art style there is more cartoony than we wanted but in terms of target identification and having a world that feels like you can move through it and spend lots of time in it theres a lot of elements to the art style that really work we wanted an art style that really feels like blizzard and we pull new influences from a lot of areas i think people over emphasize the world of warcraft comparison but are we influenced by world of warcraft of course as i think anyone who makes games nowadays they have to be

419426 we have very few things that are very significant left to be done to the technology we are light at the end of the tunnel going into the home stretch
419427 today we are seeing the carriers basing the fees on remaining months
419428 the longer you have been a customer the lower the fee this seems like a fair compromise
419429 i absolutely would switch if this penalty ever goes away
419430 theres always hope that the ruling would help but im not holding my breath
419431 i have had zero satisfaction on finding options from the carrier and so i applaud this ruling
419432 if the customer does take the discount as part of a deal to stay two years then they should not complain about these early termination fees
419433 the problem is the customer wants both the discount and the ability to leave at will
419434 you can imagine that i was not very thrilled to hear that my medical team did not see this tear in my shoulder back in april
419435 i want them to find caylee and all the missing children
419436 there will be emotion then too it wont be worry and stress but elation shes home
419437 weve let them have anything and weve offered them things they havent wanted to see
419438 and thats why they are missing year after year but if people doubt that caylee is out there they may not pick up the phone

419447 strong promotions and must have brands will help retailers stand out in the crowd as shoppers look for the best bang for their buck on back to school purchases this year
419448 consumers have been pessimistic for several months primarily because of the strains on their budgets from higher gas and food prices
419449 these survey results indicate that consumers will likely stick to the basics this fall and parents may be saying no more often as they head to the register
419450 to some extent people in florida drive more than residents in other areas it is a big state and we are spread out but at the same time we have more people on fixed incomes
419451 we usually look for clothes that are 10 and under
419452 as consumers look for deals and values discount stores are clearly well positioned
419453 to be frank this price tag is the majority of my wealth

419475 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
419476 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
419477 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
419478 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
419479 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
419480 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
419481 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
419482 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
419483 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
419484 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
419485 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
419486 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

419488 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
419489 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
419490 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
419491 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
419492 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
419493 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
419494 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
419495 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

419629 the idea was to put an infant chimp into a human family allow that chimp to learn language in the same way that human children might learn language that they would absorb it naturally from their siblings and the reason that they were using american sign language is there had been earlier studies which had shown that chimps are extremely gestural they were able to learn american sign language whereas they dont have the same voice boxes that we have but no chimp had been raised from infancy in a human language and taught asl so this was an experiment that everybody was really looking at and watching to see what would happen

419727 muslims cant say it but its clear they dont accept us here no one can speak the truth on this issue so everybodys feelings are kept inside
419728 we feel pressure maybe not all the time but we do

419732 it is about direct action outside the camp we will break the law or do whatever needs to take place to stop e on peacefully from profiting from climate change last year they made 4 2 billion in profit from creating climate change
419733 we are planning to shut the coal fired power station down and we are planning to come back when they create a new coal fired power station because we are the last generation that can do it and if we dont then there is no future for any of us
419734 theres little doubt that if we burn all of the coal that sits below the earths surface we can return the planet to the condition it was in 50 million years ago when the antarctic was a tropical forest and much of the rest of the planet would be pretty difficult for human beings to live on
419735 weve got to see that coal is not a useful resource to burn unless we can recapture the carbon that is produced by burning it
419736 we therefore need to work positively towards carbon capture and storage if we can manage that then of course we can continue to use coal to drive our economies but frankly i havent seen the proof that that can be done
419737 while we wish that every post on this blog could be about cool features or other blogger news sometimes we have to step in and admit a mistake
419738 weve noticed that a number of users have had their blogs mistakenly marked as spam and wanted to sound off real quick to let you know that despite it being friday afternoon we are working hard to sort this out
419739 we hope to have this resolved shortly and appreciate your patience as we work through the kinks brett
419740 this vast regime of pain and terror inflicted in the name of a war on terror rests in large part on the untested belief of a few high ranking leaders in washington that torture is an effective tool for eliciting valuable information but there is mayer persuasively argues little available evidence that this assumption is true and a great deal of evidence from numerous sources including the united states military and the f b i that torture is in fact one of the least effective methods of gathering information and a likely source of false confessions

419746 they have luka modric david bentley dimitar berbatov then the left back gareth bale comes on and hes worth 12m
419747 its easy for them to progress when they have money to spend we dont have that money and we have to do our best with what weve got and make players better
419748 what are our limits do you get half a bentley a quarter of bentley do we get bentleys right leg
419749 if you said to juande ramos to get rid of all his top players and give him x amount and say get to the champions league last eight he would just laugh at you

419998 khayal karte hai aap kabhi yeh bola hai beta tum gir bhi gaye toh kya hua main hun na tumhe sambhalne ke liye achha laga yeh jaan ke khayal karte hai aap
419999 kyun is kadar hairan tu mausam ka hai mehmaan tu duniya saji tere liye khud ko zara pehchan tu
