9040015 the reburial has only one aim to cover up newmans homosexuality and to disavow his love for another man
9040016 it is an act of shameless dishonesty and personal betrayal by the gay hating vatican
9040017 i wish with all my heart to be buried in father ambrose st johns grave and i give this as my last my imperative will
9040018 i have ever thought no bereavement was equal to that of a husbands or a wifes but i feel it difficult to believe that any can be greater or anyones sorrow greater than mine
9040019 nothing can justify the vaticans decision to violate newmans categorical and often stated instructions that he be buried alongside ambrose no one gave the pope permission to defy newmans wishes
9040020 they were inseparable they lived together for over 30 years like husband and wife newman was not exactly macho his softer gentler demeanour is what we associate with a gay man and there were allegations during his lifetime about his circle of homosexual friends
9040021 there is no evidence for that whatsoever and everything he newman wrote and said suggests he would have thought homosexuality was immoral not to mention that it was illegal at the time
9040022 theirs was a close friendship that some people are now trying to misrepresent and use for their own purposes
9040023 they clearly had a loving long term same sex relationship it is impossible to know whether this relationship involved sex but abstinence does not alter a persons sexual orientation

9040034 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states they needed a small victorious war

9040052 semuanya bergantung kepada rezeki jika imej siti tidak sesuai dengan sesuatu produk itu tidak jadi masalah kerana setiap syarikat ada perancangan mereka sendiri imej ini adalah sesuatu yang siti pilih dan tidak pernah terfikir untuk terkilan jika tidak mendapat tawaran lagi
9040053 mereka tidak meletakkan apa apa syarat tentang status siti sekarang dan mereka menerima siti dengan baik bagi siti sebagai anggota masyarakat tidak kira apa status kita tetapi yang lebih utama adalah apakah sumbangan yang mampu kita berikan
9040054 siti tidak boleh mengambil sesuatu tawaran tanpa memikirkan apakah siti dapat memberi komitmen seperti mana yang dikehendaki oleh syarikat yang menawarkan
9040055 insya allah sekarang ini semuanya berjalan dengan baik cuma siti harus memikir sebaiknya sebelum meneruskan kontrak atau pun menerimanya
9040056 wang hasil pembelian beg tersebut akan disalurkan kepada tabung yayasan jusco ini adalah satu perkara yang baik kerana ia dapat membantu mengurangkan penggunaan beg plastik dan dalam masa yang sama dapat membantu melindungi bumi

9040058 insya allah kontrak tahun lalu akan tamat tidak lama lagi tapi pihak mereka sedang berbincang dengan pihak siti untuk meneruskan lagi kerjasama ini alhamdulillah
9040059 gambar itu memang diambil sebelum siti bertudung dan mereka juga ada memohon persetujuan siti
9040060 keadaan berlaku kerana terlalu banyak imej siti yang tidak bertudung terutamanya pada album album siti dan di majalah juga sebelum ini memang sukar untuk menukarkannya kepada yang baru tetapi insya allah selepas ini semuanya akan berubah

9040083 this is a very unique case and frankly i dont know the ramifications of anything yet
9040084 were just always looking out the windows the whole neighborhood in general is feeling the same way
9040085 that to me is ridiculous i dont understand how that can happen
9040086 hes going to have to bang a little bit to get in at me and hopefully ill be able to wake up by then
9040087 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
9040088 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
9040089 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
9040090 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
9040091 the evidence i received busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
9040092 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
9040093 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
9040094 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
9040095 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
9040096 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
9040097 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about
9040098 if it wasnt for his friend and the grace of god thatd be it

9040115 this city is as extensive populous and rich as the city of london
9040116 the single city of manchester in the supply of its inhabitants with the single article of water has spent a larger sum of money than the east india company has spent in the fourteen years from 1834 to 1848 in public works of every kind throughout the whole of its vast dominions
9040117 which hindu or mussulman governments constructed for the service of the nations and the good of the country have been suffered to fall into dilapidation and now the want of the means of irrigation causes famines
9040118 omitted not only to initiate improvements but even to keep in repair the old works upon which the revenue depended
9040119 as regards the revival or maintenance of minor routes practically nothing has been done with the result that in some parts of the province at least channels have been silted up navigation has become limited to a few months in the year and crops can only be marketed when the khals rise high enough in the monsoon to make transport possible
9040120 stated roughly famines and scarcities have been four times as numerous during the last thirty years of the 19th century as they were one hundred years ago and four times as widespread
9040121 bengal is of all the kingdoms of the moghul best known in france
9040122 the knowledge i have acquired of bengal in two visits inclines me to believe that it is richer than egypt it exports in abundance cottons and silks rice sugar and butter it produces amply for its own consumption of wheat vegetables grains fowls ducks and geese it has immense herds of pigs and flocks of sheep and goats fish of every kind it has in profusion from rajmahal to the sea is an endless number of canals cut in bygone ages from the ganges by immense labour for navigation and irrigation
9040123 it was not an uncommon thing for the revellers to arm themselves with hammer and chisel with which they wiled away the afternoon by chipping out fragments of agate and carnelian from the cenotaphs of the emperor and his lamented queen
9040124 the importance of that immense empire to this country is rather to be estimated by the great annual addition it makes to the wealth and capital of the kingdom
9040125 wherever it was possible to put in an englishman to oust a native an englishman has been put in and has been paid from four times to twenty times as much for his services as would have sufficed for the salary of an equally capable hindoo or mohammedan official at the present time out of 39 000 officials who draw a salary of more than 1 000 rupees a year 28 000 are englishmen and only 11 000 natives moreover the 11 000 natives receive as salaries only three million pounds a year the 28 000 englishmen receive fifteen million pounds a year out of the 960 important civil offices which really control the civil administration of india 900 are filled with englishmen and only sixty with natives
9040126 the band had no idea mccain was planning on using
9040127 right now oil companies and old men are in control
9040128 promoting and endorsing prayers at graduation ceremonies and other school events of sponsoring religious ceremonies and holding official school events at churches
9040129 policies practices and customs impose on the students subtle coercive pressures to suppress their personal religious beliefs and to adopt school officials favored religious beliefs or risk incurring the disfavor of school officials
9040130 i dont think anyones beliefs should be forced upon others
9040131 but most school sponsored events are not mandatory and students have a choice as to whether or not to attend
9040132 positive net migration would be the only population growth factor
9040133 however from 2035 this positive net migration would no longer counterbalance the negative natural change and the population is projected to begin to fall

9040136 he considered conserving the land as the best thing to do for the environment
9040137 if we name the building after steve irwin it would be a good move on the schools part the school would get publicity and that would make more kids want to come to this school

9040145 if its against the law arrest me if you can handle it undress me
9040146 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refused to consider any smear or attack off limits
9040147 these comparisons are outrageous and offensive and have no place in the political process we hope that john mccain will offer a similar condemnation as his allies increasingly practice sleazy swift boat politics
9040148 better yet put me in office make me your vice president hillary hated on you so that b is irrelevant
9040149 paint the white house black and im sure thats got em terrified mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed
9040150 yeah i said it cause bush is mentally handicapped ball up all of his speeches and just throw em like candy wrap
9040151 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear
9040152 it would be nice if i could have my daughters listen to their music without me worrying they were getting bad images of themselves
9040153 today is the anniversary of katrina and were packing up to evacuate we must leave in the morning we have a little more warning this time but the stress is greater because this is a still a very fragile city full of nightmares that have not stopped and wounds that have not healed
9040154 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign

9040158 it is easy for the harper conservatives to say that they support the troops
9040159 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat

9040161 the epidemics curve appears to show that we have not yet reached the end of the outbreak because there have still been recent cases
9040162 it is reasonable to believe that these products could pose a threat to public health
9040163 please do not send flowers but donations will be greatly appreciated
9040164 we have created a new fund at mcgill the jackie kirk memorial fund which will be used to support activities related to her work such as scholarships for students from developing or conflict affected countries
9040165 will go directly to supporting the education programs on the ground that jackie worked so hard for
9040166 jackie was engaged in important work trying to improve the lives of people in afghanistan which was closely tied to her research on womens access to education in developing countries
9040167 this medal recognizes the valued contribution of those who sacrificed their health or their lives while serving canada
9040168 we were hoping it would go back beyond the date the government has made it retroactive to but they havent done that
9040169 although we still support the medal anything that honours somebody who serves in the canadian forces is a good thing
9040170 it should be for soldiers under hostile fire not some civilian contractor hiding a bunker who happens to get shrapnel in his leg
9040171 therell be another one undoubtedly in the next couple of years but i also think well see some new ones starting up as well almost against common sense
9040172 i know that everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon because of oil prices
9040173 i dont buy that because i can name two dozen airlines that have gone bankrupt in canada when oil was 20
9040174 the only attraction theyve got is price and price is the easiest thing to copy
9040175 geoffrey was one of the kindest much loved and uniquely talented people we knew he genuinely made the world a funnier place it is an absolute tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time
9040176 we are shocked and deeply saddened at this terrible news
9040177 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9040178 go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things
9040179 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9040180 indicated to the airport the possibility of replacing the plane with another
9040181 however in the end it also told the airport control centre that it had decided to continue with the plane which is the one that crashed
9040182 has been disastrous for children who are always the most vulnerable in an emergency
9040183 i havent met her before she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and you know im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans
9040184 unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at top of ticket as i indicated in my speech last night i think that he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him in in his policies
9040185 i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate
9040186 im pleased with my choice for vice president joe biden i think hes the man who can help me guide this country in a better direction and help working families
9040187 an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9040188 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9040189 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9040190 i think that campaigns start getting these uh uh hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9040191 lots of journos on northwest 558 including rather and schieffer
9040192 golly im not going to fill out all those required fields
9040193 suppose that every tool we had could perform its task either at our bidding or itself perceiving the need that shuttles in a loom could fly to and fro and a plucker play a lyre of its own accord

9040198 at the same time the council and its advisory board will seek to deal with the problems of those who have confessed the biblical faith in the face of hostility and found the need on grounds of conscience and in matters of great significance to break the normal bonds of fellowship in the name of the gospel for the sake of the anglican communion this is an effort to bring order out of the chaos of the present time and to make sure as far as possible that some of the most faithful anglican christians are not lost to the communion it is expected that priority will be given to the possible formation of a province in north america for the common cause partnership
9040199 the captain of ryanair flight fr9462 from milan bergamo to rome ciampino diverted to rome fiumicino as a safety precaution
9040200 the aircraft undercarriage had extended and the aircraft landed normally at fiumicino where passengers were disembarked for a coach transfer to rome
9040201 of course you think wow i could have had a lot of money
9040202 but at the same time i dont regret it because that time will come

9040206 thats something you cant be concerned about you cant play cautious you have to be full go all the time and if it happens it happens
9040207 being captain to me isnt about the games i couldnt care less about walking out to the coin toss
9040208 being a leader for this team being someone the team wants to be a leader and to be someone who represents this team is just an honor
9040209 i want you and the prime minister to know is that i shall at all times welcome it if you will keep me in touch personally with anything you want me to know about
9040210 used a picturesque term for horse excrement to summarize his reaction
9040211 lets not overlook the impact that snider being talked to by the best instructers the jays have those in the big leagues maybe they can give him some direction and pointers to work on over the winter that can help him out long run
9040212 so you take a look at him now see if he looks ready for mlb pitching and use that information to help you decide how much you invest in a dh of type in the off season if the kid looks like hes ready to handle it you spend less on a dh and focus more of your budget elsewhere if he looks lost you start thinking about 2010 for snider and longer term and higher salary for your dh
9040213 i thought wed established already that hitting coaches do not a hitter make
9040214 lets see if she gets a boner from the movies i just bought thats the only true test
9040215 um just a couple things here guillermo quiroz kevin cash now diaz what other triple a amazing talent are we gonna wind up giving up for guys like bautista who have failed to even make contact with a fastball the last three games
9040216 are you saying that guillermo quiroz kevin cash are above average major league players
9040217 three excellent triple a players they have made statements and other teams clearly want them these are very very high demand players
9040218 i havent actually had to say this on a wednesday with jp though i do say it the other six days of the week if youre going to call at least make sense thank you
9040219 theres a reason why jp doesnt respect the average fan
9040220 if somebody wants to know whether they should hire me for a job in baseball theyre not going to ask the toronto writers what they think
9040221 candy health alert aretha franklin not good for kelsey grammers heart
9040222 i told them if i was swinging the bat extremely well if i put up the numbers like i did last year or whatever we wouldnt be in this situation
9040223 nothing would have been better than to go down friggin yonge street and celebrating with the guys i became really close with in the last year and a half
9040224 to me the greatest city in the world is toronto im not saying that because i played there or im a canadian its a city ive always loved
9040225 i enjoyed my time and the fans were unbelievable the organization was unbelievable i had a blast
9040226 listen travis you dont suck you made the show at age 20 fergawdsake guys who suck dont make the bigs before 21
9040227 breaking off diplomatic relations with tbilisi is not moscows choice and the responsibility lies with tbilisi
9040228 this election has never been about me its been about you
9040229 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
9040230 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9040231 what politics has become requires a level of triviality and artiface and nonsense that i find i have in short supply
9040232 theyre asking for four more years we should give them 10 to 20
9040233 only when its dark enough can you see the stars
9040234 oh obamas not going to change nothing hes just a bunch of talk
9040235 the best we can say about barry is he is better then mccain
9040236 the world is far more impressed with the power of our example than the example of our power
9040237 i think ure going to see teams more protective of their young pitchers
9040238 umm frank thomas david eckstein trott glaulen these guys were all brought in based on what they did in the past and except for one year of glaus and a half of thomas theyve not come anywhere near earning the dough the jays are paying them
9040239 your point about aj being a better risk than those other guys um sure it seems like that now but it could have worked out any number of ways
9040240 the way the aj contract built in a whole fuckload of additional risk for the jays
9040241 dont you think aj having pitched well and healthy enough for it to be beneficial to him to opt out proves that the aj signing was a good risk to take
9040242 umm frank thomas david eckstein trott glaulen these guys were all brought in based on what they did in the past and except for one year of glaus and a half of thomas theyve not come anywhere near earning the dough the jays are paying them
9040243 bring the combat troops home and end the war means
9040244 i feel like a dead person i was gone i become crazy
9040245 i didnt care at this point i was ready to die
9040246 rendition as currently practiced is undermining our moral credibility and standing abroad and weakening the coalitions with foreign governments that we need to effectively combat international terrorism
9040247 in many cases of extraordinary rendition it appears that the seized persons are expressly delivered to foreign jurisdictions to circumvent constitutional rights
9040248 they are rendered in a manner to specifically deprive them of due process and civil liberties protections
9040249 when the cia delivered talaat fouad qassem to the egyptian authorities it was certainly aware of how he would be treated
9040250 at a minimum countries with indisputably lousy human rights records say syria were off limits
9040251 now though the bush team seems to have dramatically eroded such safeguards
9040252 the administrations avowed aim was to allow the transfer of suspects to jurisdictions with laxer constraints on coercive interrogation
9040253 torture thus became a primary goal not merely a collateral consequence of rendition to third countries in this respect the post 9 11 extraordinary rendition system is qualitatively different from the rendition programs that preceded it
9040254 we do not transport anyone to a country if we believe it more likely than not that the individual will be tortured
9040255 we dont kick the expletive out of them we send them to other countries so they can kick the expletive out of them
9040256 the cable was a black electrical cable about two inches thick they hit me with it everywhere on my body they mostly aimed for my palms but sometimes missed and hit my wrists they were sore and red for three weeks they also struck me on my hips and lower back i could hear other prisoners being tortured and screaming and screaming
9040257 it might be better sometimes for suspects to remain in the hands of foreign authorities who might be able to use more aggressive interrogation techniques
9040258 were operating through sort of you know a dark side
9040259 torture is used to extract information detainees are frequently stripped to their underwear hung by their wrists with their feet touching the floor or forced to stand for prolonged periods doused with hot and cold water beaten forced to stand outdoors in cold weather and subjected to electric shocks
9040260 local human rights organizations have cited numerous cases of security forces allegedly abusing and torturing prisoners torture and abuse of detainees was also reportedly common many instances of abuse went unreported
9040261 to arrest people and send them back to their country of origin with the promise that they wont be tortured thats the promise we receive
9040262 torture is never acceptable nor do we hand over people to countries that do torture
9040263 to countries where we believe or we know theyre going to be tortured
9040264 the united states does not permit tolerate or condone torture under any circumstances the united states does not transport and has not transported detainees from one country to another for the purpose of interrogation using torture the united states has not transported anyone and will not transport anyone to a country when we believe he will be tortured
9040265 u s officials may seek to transfer suspects from a western ally to the middle east because the western allys laws or inclinations prevent the close monitoring or aggressive interrogation of a terrorism suspect in contrast to many middle eastern countries with poor human rights records many u s allies in the middle east have a far lower standard of evidence and are willing to bend what rules they have in response to a u s request some middle eastern countries can also persuade or coerce a suspects relatives
9040266 they say they are not abusing them and that satisfies the legal requirement but we all know they do
9040267 under the convention against torture and farra 1998 foreign affairs reform and restructuring act we are obligated not to send someone to a country where they will be tortured so we use these diplomatic assurances to hopefully constrain the actions of the country to which the individual is sent the arar case demonstrates the dangerous practice of relying on these diplomatic assurances
9040268 such stories hurt americas standing in the eyes of its allies and erode support for u s counterterrorism efforts
9040269 weakened ties to friendly governments are felt later when they refuse to send troops to iraq resist trade overtures or otherwise demonstrate their displeasure
9040270 violates numerous international human rights standards including the universal declaration of human rights the international covenant on civil and political rights the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights the convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees the convention against torture the vienna convention on consular relations and the geneva conventions
9040271 take into account all relevant considerations including where applicable the existence in the state concerned of a consistent pattern of gross flagrant or mass violations of human rights
9040272 it shall be the policy of the united states not to expel extradite or otherwise affect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture
9040273 the practice of transferring an individual to a foreign state in circumstances that make it more likely than not that the individual will be subjected to torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment
9040274 u s commitments under article 3 of the convention against torture and our related policy are absolute there are no exceptions based on national security or the criminality of an individual
9040275 we reject extraordinary rendition for torture related purposes we reject secret detention centres we categorically reject torture and we refuse to overlook the occurrence of such activities on british territory anywhere britain is committed to investigating the circumstances surrounding these two incidents and to following up on any leads or suspicions related to other similar incidents
9040276 egyptian american cooperation in extraordinary rendition strengthens the least law abiding elements of the egyptian state its internal security forces and thus corrodes the prospects for full egyptian democracy
9040277 those who live in a glass house should not throw stones america has a lot of dirt on its hands
9040278 in our long term effort to stem the tide of international terrorism our commitments to the rule of law and to individual rights and civil liberties are among our most formidable weapons the controversial aspects of the united states governments use of rendition have been used by propagandists and recruiters to fuel and sustain international terrorist organizations with a constant stream of new recruits
9040279 offer an example of moral leadership in the world committed to treat people humanely abide by the rule of law and be generous and caring to our neighbors
9040280 very tainted you could bet on the testimony given to you it was altered in a way that would serve the interests of the country that was giving it it would be far from coupled with what was actually being said
9040281 to build a better freer world we must first behave in ways that reflect the decency and aspirations of the american people this means ending the practice of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries of detaining thousands without charge or trial of maintaining a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of law
9040282 let me personally give you what our government has not an apology
9040283 congress has a role here in ensuring that our laws our values are respected by any administration this congress unfortunately has abdicated its oversight responsibility a failure which these hearings will begin to correct but while congress took no action others stepped up to the plate much of what we know about the renditions program is known because of the important work of news agencies and nongovernmental organizations in january the european parliament made an important contribution to the debate by issuing a report on what the cia was doing in europe and on their own governments apparent complicity in its operations
9040284 these kidnappings and subsequent tortures have done much to discredit the united states in countries from which the suspects were taken and they have interfered with our intelligence gathering from officials there who are now accused of complicity with american disregard of the laws of those sovereign nations
9040285 we believe they tumbled or fell about 200 feet the child was described as seriously injured and the man less so
9040286 the second helicopter recovered the lady who had fallen and took her to hospital
9040287 it was wet and slippy they were just below the cloud line around 2 000 feet up the mountain it is quite steep there

9040291 there are those who say to you we are rushing this issue of civil rights i say we are 172 years late
9040292 the time has arrived for the democratic party to get out of the shadow of states rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights
9040293 he was not a good signing by the very fact that hes sitting on the bench right now
9040294 unfortunately we already had two players who between them can field a lot better and hit a little worse
9040295 as for eckstein as a good leadoff hitter thats a different conversation altogether
9040296 hes sitting on the bench by the very fact that cito chooses to do it that way it doesnt mean eckstein shouldnt start or that hes worse than j mac
9040297 the idea of giving the most abs to the person who was supposed to post the lowest ops on your team is a terrible one
9040298 which was exactly the knock on him that was going around the league at the time of the signing his defense was so poor that very few teams could risk running him out there day after day
9040299 if he went 000 350 000 youd want him leading off
9040300 thats why i think eckstein is extraneous to this teams success and because hes putting up the numbers expected of him ricciardi should have seen his lack of value to the club
9040301 it provides excellent support for your babys back and head and guarantees that his her legs and arms are in a physiologically correct position when your baby is a little older and has a stronger neck the neck rest can be folded down so that the child can face forwards and look around from newborn at least 3 5 kg 8 lbs and 53 cm 21 ins up to 11 kgs 25 lbs

9040304 something is happening in america and people are prepared and ready to make that great leap
9040305 america we cannot turn back during his address barack obama confronted every criticism made by john mccain and the republicans of his campaign and the democrats head on from his ego and rock star status to his lack of foreign policy experience and his tax policies and he went so far as to attack the strength of john mccains campaign national security
9040306 more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
9040307 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
9040308 zero foreign policy experience would be only a heartbeat away from the presidency

9040327 we are no longer a christian nation we are also a muslim nation

9040330 ok this thing isnt going the way we want so lets take a step back this year
9040331 its funny how the national u s media guys get all the credit if rosenthal used the line about teams fearing a j might not opt out of his deal then he got that out of one of my mailbags or a column

9040339 some days its a little its a lot to take
9040340 just try and live every day the best you can

9040361 there is nothing in the text itself that limits us to allegory
9040362 here the songs real importance to the holy scriptures and to christian faith begins to become apparent from first to last the bible portrays god as passionate
9040363 whom we choose to love determines the identity for which we assume responsibility
9040364 when god loves he desires nothing but to be loved since he loves us for no other reason than to be loved for he knows that those who love him are blessed in their very love
9040365 the church itself has a poor record of recognizing the supremacy of love it boils down to the fatal mistake that intellect rather than emotion is the governing principle of good conduct
9040366 forsaking all others i will love you as long as i live
9040367 what we need above all is a relationship with god we can and must love god for gods own sake but we can also love god for our own sake
9040368 ive done everything right but ill never be good enough
9040369 if you put in a sloppy effort then youll get sloppy results that is the way it should be this is fair if you put in a lot of effort you are not guaranteed to succeed but just by participating and focusing on something you significantly increase your chances id much rather say i gave it a shot than just accept failure
9040370 so instead of thinking life is so difficult and unfair get out there and make something happen dont just go with the flow become who you want to be from a fitness standpoint i know you can get healthy if you really want to you just need a systematic approach like anything else
9040371 most people can understand that becoming wealthy means saving a little bit every month over many years so that you get the compound interest effect the same is true for your health you have to do a little something every day and your body will reward you over time

9040383 we dont need to be collecting taxes that we dont need
9040384 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
9040385 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
9040386 the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors

9040396 we are the ones building roads designing mass transit buying the police cars and dump trucks were the ones lighting up the earth when you look at pictures from space together we have huge purchasing power and if we invest wisely that can have huge implications for the environment
9040397 the weather is extremely hot which is exacerbating the conditions
9040398 the hygiene conditions are very bad the hand pumps for clean drinking water are not good enough sanitation facilities people are defecating in open spaces this is obviously extremely risky in terms of spreading disease and we already have heard cases of fever and diarrhea have been reported so the immediate priority certainly as far as unicef is concerned is to deliver life saving supplies of medicine food clean drinking water and access to proper sanitation
9040399 also what we have heard is that around 5 000 people from bihar state have crossed into nepal to seek relief from the floods many of the displaced are sheltering in schools what we understand is around 30 percent of those are children

9040405 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9040406 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9040407 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9040408 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for
9040409 i mean undoubtedly at some stage before the end of the parliament he will want to do a reshuffle but im not expecting one imminently i do not think there will be a reshuffle
9040410 theres lots of people whod like to do my job and no doubt
9040411 yes i do think he can i do think he will
9040412 er well well its always difficult you know but gordon in september up to party conference has got the opportunity to do that and he will do that its absolutely imperative
9040413 i dont understand why the us has to meddle in abortion opposing it so much when its legal in their own country
9040414 93 in the blue of the u s flag in the right center of the page namely how that sort of placement is compatible with the alleged sanctity of the flag strange my point really is that all of this is just too much noise

9040418 competition between women is the classic diversionary conflict but thats just fab for certain ideological forms in particular capitalism which counts on the individuation of conflict in order to divert the attentive gaze away from questions of systematic exploitation
9040419 they will surely reproduce notions of empowering that well just move the pieces around and never think about alternative ways of living thats exactly what it means to say that ideology reproduces itself across seemingly real and even radical social changes

9040421 the clashs politics didnt have the easy outlet of a war without a war politics needed to be more complex
9040422 but as an album this first record blends clashes really all three musical forms into one sonic event rather than mood attuned id argue that the clashs sonic experiment is politically attuned
9040423 had the clash simply mimicked ska or reggae bands theyd have been and maybe would still be much more digestible white people have always loved seeing other white people do what black people do
9040424 the nice sound of sgt peppers is also the sound of an ideology were comfortable with

9040429 i applaud sen mccain for selecting gov palin this decision is yet another example of why the american people can trust him to make wise decisions and to confidently lead this country
9040430 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9040431 a historic moment for women and for the republican party as well as a choice guaranteed to energize values voters i believe we now have the most pro life ticket in history running on the most pro life platform in history
9040432 how ironic that on his 72nd birthday mccain has raised the question of whether his running mate is prepared to be commander in chief and lead the country gov palin and john mccain are a good match mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about his choice for vice president only reinforces that failure
9040433 on his 72nd birthday sen mccain has chosen a vp based on her political currency rather than her ability to lead our country in a crisis if john mccain wins in november hell be the oldest president in u s history and sarah palin would be a heartbeat away from being our commander in chief its not only fair but critical in this case to ask if shes up for the job of commander in chief we just cant afford a gamble like this with our future
9040434 its a great day for the nation and alaskans have known and worked with sarah for over a decade from her service as mayor of wasilla alaska in her role as president of the alaska conference of mayors and most recently as our governor
9040435 gov palins knowledge of energy issues will be critical as she and senator mccain begin their path toward the white house
9040436 perhaps most importantly alaska is one of 12 states that allow the medical use of marijuana and one in five americans currently live in those states the gop ticket should embrace the time honored republican principle of local control by promising to end the federal governments war on sensible medical marijuana laws in both red and blue states
9040437 our shelters are already on alert food preparation bedding and sanitary kits are already being pushed into the area for staging
9040438 those resources will be available the minute that they decide to open these shelters
9040439 we also have the capability of preparing anywhere between 3 to 5 000 meals a day just depending on the need

9040503 i had to chuckle at david carrs article about bloggers
9040504 journalists at convention still dont know what to make of bloggers
9040505 typewriters were terrible tools for writing drafts if only because they had no facility for crossing sections out at least with a pen you could make a quick line through an entire paragraph that failed word processors still act as if we know what were writing oh theyre obviously much better than typewriters for which i have zero nostalgia ah remember the month i spent locked in my room typing the final draft of my dissertation sweet word processors let you swiftly delete failed paragraphs let you undo mistakes and re do mistaken mistakes and awkwardly track revisions but theyre not designed for writing when youre unsure of what youre writing

9040515 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9040516 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9040517 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for
9040518 i mean undoubtedly at some stage before the end of the parliament he will want to do a reshuffle but im not expecting one imminently i do not think there will be a reshuffle

9040554 whether its protecting gorillas in the republic of congo or monkeys and gibbons in cambodia conservation can and does work when you have government commitment and scientific knowledge on the ground
9040555 now we must put into place the management to truly protect these populations and apply the approach to other regions where primates are in trouble
9040556 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
9040557 wcs is therefore committed to continuing to work with the cambodian government to ensure that these globally important primate populations will continue to remain secure

9040573 why dont we move the sink cabinet forward a bit and try to get it from the back
9040574 its not just about the green roof this transcends into various ways to make buildings more green
9040575 essentially cities are going to benefit more than any individuals will benefit because it will save with infrastructure costs
9040576 its a modest help what individuals receive but it changes the way we think about infrastructure
9040577 its not only the right thing to do but it can make economic sense
9040578 the windiest sites have not been built because there is no way to move that electricity from there to the load centers
9040579 if you want to do it on a national scale where the transmission line distances will be much longer and utility regulations are different congress must act
9040580 modernizing the electric infrastructure is an urgent national problem and one we all share
9040581 with the federal government not investing not setting good regulatory mechanisms and basically taking a back seat on everything except drilling and fossil fuels the grid has not been modernized especially for wind energy

9040586 the reality is weve had five urban design studies done for west main and weve now just finally begun funding it

9040600 an uncertain revolution why the rise of a genetic model of mental illness has not increased tolerance
9040601 in the case of schizophrenia genetic arguments are associated with fears regarding violence
9040602 in fact attributing schizophrenia to genes is no different from attributing it to bad character either way americans see those with schizophrenia as damaged in some essential way and therefore likely to be violent however when applied to depression genetic arguments have very different connotations they are associated with social acceptance if you imagine that someones depression is a genetic problem the condition seems more real and less blameworthy its in their genes theyre not weak so i should accept them for who they are
9040603 while the stigma surrounding mental illness has not diminished the rate of treatment for psychiatric disorders has increased
9040604 the culture surrounding mental illness has become more treatment focused with direct to consumer advertising of psychiatric medications now a mainstay of popular media

9040648 thats something we did not have when katrina hit the gulf coast three years ago

9040685 university of idaho alumni are sizable in number but remain a close knit community
9040686 a large number of university alumni such as sarah have gone on to distinguish themselves in public service
9040687 youve got an idaho girl there on the ticket shes fairly tough idaho women are fairly tough so shell be able to handle anything that biden or obama can throw at her
9040688 the nice thing from a policy perspective is that shes obviously knowledgable on western issues public land issues and other things that are of concern in the west

9040690 if we look at your average medieval town or your average greek polis most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the amazon

9040693 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns

9040697 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9040698 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
9040699 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
9040700 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
9040701 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
9040702 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
9040703 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
9040704 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
9040705 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems

9040732 hes scored some absolute crackers with his left this season his goal against pittsburgh was probably our goal of the year without his incredible no look pass to matthew mbuta for our second goal against harrisburg in the cup we wouldnt have had the chance to knock the new york red bulls in the next round

9040868 i live in the vineyard and im not going to use anything thats harmful to my family
9040869 the yield was a bit less the first 10 years but then we got it going and didnt have the crises that come with dependence upon chemicals
9040870 the important thing is that you get to know the vineyard better and pay more attention to things
9040871 thirty five years ago not a vine in napa valley was irrigated
9040872 the more biological organisms living in the soil the better
9040873 powdery mildew and insects are still a problem but a healthy vine will defend itself and a healthy vine means healthy grapes and eventually a healthy environment

9040883 i am pleased to be in woodward today to present a 1 million dollar grant from eda that will help build the woodward community campus
9040884 the campus will be located next to and work jointly with the new facility constructed by northwest oklahoma state university to offer academic and economic development programs and assistance for the area
9040885 in oklahoma over the past five and a half years eda grants have resulted in nearly 12 000 jobs being created or saved investments of about 22 7 million have leveraged another 24 million in state and local dollars and more than 437 million in private sector dollars this local experience is confirmed by studies that show that eda uses federal dollars efficiently and effectively creating and retaining long term jobs at an average cost that is among the lowest in government
9040886 today is truly a great day to be in woodward this eda grant is a great addition to the 5th fastest growing city in oklahoma i would particularly like to thank senator inhofe for all of his tremendous work in securing federal assistance not only today but for his previous efforts including assistance for downtown enhancements improvements at our airport and buildings at southern plains range research center woodward is certainly grateful for senator inhofes continued leadership
9040887 no one is more thankful for senator inhofes leadership than eda this new workforce training center is a great example of senator inhofes leadership to woodward county the fact is our national economy cannot be strong without strong regional economies
9040888 the speech demonstrated great strength and confidence he challenged mccain directly without blinking but respectfully
9040889 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9040890 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
9040891 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on behalf of them that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
9040892 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on nov 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
9040893 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9040894 speaking of celebrities barack obama proved why he is one at invesco field home of the denver broncos last night before 85 000 crying cheering adoring fans and whats wrong with that he is a real talent and he excites and inspires his supporters
9040895 those of us who are not supporters need to step back and quit watching in awe and prepare for battle obamas natural and developed speaking style is unchallengeable
9040896 and no one was ever better his words enlightened gave comfort inspired and made americans feel good about themselves again he also had a core of beliefs developed over a long period of time that led to a very effective agenda the democrats now have their own version of an rr orator and like reagan obamas speeches are his own words

9040954 we are under advisements from lawyers not to talk about it
9040955 i think my goal was just to make the cut because ive had great success here in the past
9040956 so i figured if i make the cut itll be a win for me here this week
9040957 its so funny the last three tournaments now monday tuesday wednesday i cant find the face or the putting stroke and it seems to work its way into play on thursday
9040958 thats good to see just knowing that even though you dont feel 100 percent confident with your swing and putting it seems to work that means i can still improve and get better
9040959 i felt like my timing has been good i just havent hit it solid and just the putting stroke has felt a little strange but under the gun it just feels a lot different
9040960 even today i left four or five putts out there that i could have made and i hit the ball extremely well had a lot of chances this game is funny you can feel great and step up on the golf course and shoot 75
9040961 obviously my game is in pretty good form so if i can try to focus on being 100 percent for the ryder cup it doesnt mean that im going to play bad these weeks it just means that maybe my focus is more down the road
9040962 obviously being my first ryder cup i want to play well and represent our country to the best of my ability and if we win that would be great if not at least i go there and had a great time knowing that i gave it my all thats all you can do
9040963 i think theres so much that i can learn from phil mickelson and jim furyk and stewart cink some of these guys that played in the past to kind of guide me through the week
9040964 i think the golf will take care of itself im playing well its going to carry over into the ryder cup its not going to change
9040965 obviously playing alternate shot and better ball its a little bit different mind frame than coming out here and just trying to shoot a good number my role is just to try to go out there and play the best i can and help the team
9040966 do you think the guy who did these would be right to do the cover for that new book
9040967 follow this link then look at pictures 6 11 and 13
9040968 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time
9040969 i enjoyed reading e today very well written if your mother does say so herself and just the right touch of humor
9040970 we dont have the resources or time to add a fourth race to the launch of starcraft ii but im sure in the event that we decide to do an expansion set its a feature thatll come up for discussion
9040971 we talked about the possibility of a fourth race early on but we felt like we had a finite amount of great ideas and wanted to make sure we focused all the cool best ideas on the existing three races rather than diluting those ideas across four races
9040972 were really seeing a lot of people asking for assistance
9040973 just like with other americans folks are looking for bargains and store brands and theyre buying things that go further maybe you havent eaten rice or spaghetti as much as you do now
9040974 you have a number of folks who come into the military and are making more money than they ever thought they would
9040975 the problem is they dont understand how much it is going to cost they dont think in terms of hard economic times they think in terms of how much money they have
9040976 expenses are never solid they move up and down all the time thats where people get into trouble
9040977 what im seeing is young people coming out of their parents home and they have no kind of background for dealing with finances
9040978 everybody wants everything now im seeing that change more all the time its the instant gratification generation they incur debt quickly because we all know how easy it is to get credit
9040979 when financial problems are introduced into an airmens life their mind might be other places and it can affect the mission
9040980 some clients i see have hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt credit card debt judgments it varies
9040981 you need to put that money to something you could use in the future
9040982 im seeing a lot of really nice cars on base corvettes brand new mustangs hummers thats money you could be investing
9040983 but 36 percent is still a lot and they really reach out to military members
9040984 people say i can afford to pay 115 a month what theyre not looking at is that they are going to pay back 5 000 on a 3 000 loan
9040985 military members are lucky because they have relief societies like ours
9040986 we see people everyday for whom something has happened and they dont have the money to pay for it
9040987 just having the piece of mind of having that money in your account is a good way to live
9040988 the servicemember is 100 percent responsible for paying off the balance of the card
9040989 everything a soldier can possibly need the army is going to do its very best to help them
9040990 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all

9040997 dells direct sales method gives it the inside track with large sophisticated enterprises
9040998 dells rise from 20 a share to 25 reflected a realisation that dell was not such a chump of a company
9040999 if you want to be the market leader in any electronic device you have to move beyond direct only and have multiple sales channels
9041000 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
9041001 we always worry a little bit but we think our arguments are pretty strong

9041020 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9041021 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9041022 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman

9041027 what those opposite want to forget about is the 12 interest rate rises on the trot 10 of them under them
9041028 that is what has put australian families under tremendous financial pressure
9041029 their 10 interest rate rises in a row are slowing the australian economy and the opposition will not admit to that
9041030 whether we are on message is a matter for the political commentators

9041043 vaccines are probably one of the top two or three public health interventions of all time
9041044 they now have been so successful they suffer from their success because people dont see the diseases and the horrors associated with them
9041045 you get something called herd immunity although i wish there were a better name for it
9041046 if you get enough people vaccinated even people who arent vaccinated are protected because the disease cant transmit the virus cant get past the wall of vaccinated people weve created
9041047 several vaccines for that age group just kind of came up
9041048 the issue is explaining the vaccine at a time when neither the child nor the parent want to think about this when the girl is still preteen
9041049 i say this is to prevent cervical cancer and you have to receive it before youre infected
9041050 theres not the same push if youre not going to college so they dont think about it
9041051 i think eventually it will be universally recommended for everyone every year
9041052 we need to do a better job at immunizing people against flu
9041053 everyone over 50 should get one and so should kids because were discovering theyre the reservoir for flu theyre in a closed container called school so they transmit it easily between themselves and then they bring that little present home
9041054 if my patients come in for a routine visit or a sick visit ill look at their immunization record
9041055 youre not going to get that so much if youre bouncing around from provider to provider because theyre not going to have the record
9041056 si los estados europeos quieren servir a los intereses de la pol tica exterior de estados unidos entonces en mi opini n no van a conseguir nada de esto

9041061 the most effective leaders are going to recognize this immediately and prepare for it accordingly
9041062 the enemy is going to go where the people are so coalition forces need to be there too
9041063 people are where the fight is won or lost and insurgents are very aware of that if the people gathered at night thats obviously going to weigh into your tactical planning
9041064 attacks did follow a very predictable cycle which people i think are familiar with at this point
9041065 its an important step in terms of rapport building in terms of demonstrating who coalition leaders feel is important
9041066 it was a great opportunity to build up the stature of certain members of the community but also to build up your own personal power base as you work yourself in with them culturally
9041067 having good cultural awareness is as essential as marksmanship because its about the populace and its about intelligence
9041068 you can build trust so much more rapidly if you have demonstrated cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity
9041069 the further away and the higher we get from the lows of july make the likelihood of revisiting those levels less likely
9041070 this means that we have an absence of downward pressure and this is how big rallies begin to take place
9041071 the mainstream community went after them and basically said look as long as you dont think that muhammad is the last prophet you have violated the creed of islam and you are not muslim
9041072 people continue to have the belief that he has broken the seal
9041073 our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter
9041074 recalling the white smock worn by those who need to handle things in a laboratory
9041075 the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him
9041076 i think it will be very exciting starting a new culture at a new school and building a new community and hopefully building it around some of those environmental mind sets i was involved in putting in a rain garden at chavez and a bunch of us at chavez took a prairie restoration class
9041077 dans small business background and strong new mexico values make him an excellent choice to represent the people of the 3rd district
9041078 like me dan believes in empowering people not government he is a strong proponent of low taxes less regulation and an energy policy that increases americas access to its own resources
9041079 his work with infrastructure and waste water treatment makes him especially qualified for serving the needs of northern new mexico clean water is a critical component of healthy communities and dan has important first hand knowledge of the issue
9041080 he is exactly the kind of person we need in washington representing the interests of new mexico
9041081 i have personally seen him working incredibly hard around the district and its that kind of dedication that will serve him well in the house
9041082 john mccain could not have picked a better running mate she is not afraid to stand up to special interests and has made cutting government waste a priority in her administration
9041083 she has strong family values and i think voters across the nation will respond to that
9041084 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9041085 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9041086 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built

9041191 when are you guys going to have a new cd out
9041192 we were working with a manager who was shopping us to labels in nashville and we had met with five of them who were serious about signing us after a lot of thought and discussion we decided to sign with lyric street records which is a division of disney they had paired us up with producer mark bright and everything seemed perfect mark had just finished producing carrie underwood so we knew he could work well with female artists and he had previously produced mountain heart so we knew he was great with bluegrass and acoustic instruments
9041193 it really hit me when mark bright mentioned one day that when he worked with rascal flatts the biggest problem he had was convincing them not to record any of their original material that hit me hard as we wanted to do exactly that i dont mean any disrespect to mark or lyric street they were great to us and treated us very fairly it just started to look like we were heading into a place where we would lose control over our music
9041194 people were telling us we were crazy but to me selling out means doing music you dont believe in and we didnt want to start out like that
9041195 we started recording in in mid may and are nearly finished now between may and the end of august ill bet we put in 3 solid months of recording we wanted to get everything just right and it has turned out to be exactly what we wanted it to be weve been working with brent truitt in nashville recording in his studio and with him co producing with the three of us he makes us feel so comfortable in the studio when things get intense and gets great tones on everything when we get home from europe we have just a few overdubs to finish and well be done it should be mixed and mastered by mid october
9041196 we love this record it shows how much weve grown in the last two years it sounds like what it is a five piece acoustic band very much like our live show

9041200 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9041201 put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9041202 why with so many other qualified women and men in his party did john mccain choose sarah palin
9041203 they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path
9041204 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate
9041205 he said that the mccain palin ticket is very strong he wished her good luck told her that she will be a fantastic vice presidential candidate and that he is looking forward to a great victory in november
9041206 shes not someone who has millions and millions of dollars
9041207 this is a tough smart person who can relate to the average joe
9041208 she is going to energize the republican party at that convention
9041209 shes new shes fresh theyre going to like her and theyre going to believe her
9041210 i think shes more representative of the future of the republican party
9041211 the women of america arent finished yet we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all

9041214 s amp p on track for 4th most volatile year since great depression
9041215 the us housing market currently suffering the worst downturn since the great depression
9041216 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
9041217 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control
9041218 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
9041219 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others

9041241 eri come un sole il mio sole personale il rimedio migliore alle nuvole
9041242 the idea was to raise awareness among families especially because this is the first layer of barrier and to help people to realize they are not alone and be able to face the problem
9041243 the cast i worked with had no cinematic training which i though would be useful to access things that a professional actor wouldnt be capable
9041244 usually an actor is trained to show things i thought it was important to show what a person was hiding
9041245 right up to the day of shooting i hadnt found a suitable character to play that role and i even thought about cutting her out
9041246 as it is a very masculine and male oriented society the thought of really coming out and revealing that fact they wanted to come out and revealing they are not a real male has real problems all of the women i met who wanted to be male didnt want this to be known for them it was a real problem coming out
9041247 the only way of really finding out a mans true character is to play golf with him
9041248 in no other walk of life does the cloven hoof so quickly display itself
9041249 going for the green on the links with canadas business and political elite
9041250 the whole point of it was to be as honest as i could be with the people i was playing with
9041251 thats the essence of it you hope to show a side of these guys that youre just not going to see any other way
9041252 hes one of my two favourite stories in the book hes manic and he comes across as manic
9041253 people probably wont know gerry but the truth of the matter is theyve probably gone to see something gerrys put on theyve probably seen a rolling stones show or u2 or gone to see david bowie or whomever
9041254 shes remarkable just because shes such an interesting personality and has so many interests wine photography architecture and corporate governance
9041255 and you probably learn something about the guy at some point whether you learn everything about his business or not you learn something more important you learn about the guy himself you learn about what makes him tick what interests him
9041256 he hits it right across the water right at the green and he makes it across just a dead yank
9041257 balsillies got the three wood in his hand he goes and sticks the three wood back in the bag and pulls out the driver he cant be one upped
9041258 you know all these guys are competitive you know thats how they got to where they are but rarely do you see it demonstrated in such a clear way
9041259 in a corporate setting you and i are never going to see how that comes out because were never going to be invited when theyre negotiating a 30 million deal to take something over
9041260 the tricky part about it for me is how do you play a halfway decent golf game take notes and think up questions to continue the conversation
9041261 he said theres a lot of f words in this how many other people swear in the book thompson laughs as he recalls barads reaction

9041330 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9041331 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9041332 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9041338 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9041339 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9041340 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9041341 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9041342 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9041343 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9041344 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini

9041378 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9041379 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9041380 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9041381 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9041382 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9041383 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica

9041389 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
9041390 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti

9041398 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9041399 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9041400 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9041401 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9041402 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9041403 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9041425 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9041426 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale

9041454 we are partnering with market leaders in every industry vertical including law healthcare science technology finance and all the usual suspects
9041455 there is little to no value trying to reach users on these types of sites what is valuable and risk free is providing real time job opportunities and a new user experience to legal professionals and legal employers recruiters findlaw like 1 100 of realmatchs other partners understand and will adopt our new technology and risk free pricing model
9041456 heavily to their users via e mail press release media outreach and even direct calls to law firms courts and other legal organizations they already have relationships with
9041457 the partnership is for 24 months with options for more its a revenue share but both findlaw and realmatch have committed some marketing dollars and resources aimed at driving legal employers and legal professionals into the offer
9041458 they are a total waste of time in my opinion the interface is chewed up i had trouble loading my resume and getting other screens to complete correctly
9041459 as you can see by the e mail below it didnt pick up my login so that autofill is blank

9041506 i was wrong i did my time for it i shouldnt be harassed
9041507 anytime that someone behaves inappropriately in our jurisdiction we can ask them to leave
9041508 i mean ive been keeping my nose clean i must be doing something right
9041509 a little bit more information might have been available to the parents which would have caused a bit more caution
9041510 i would like to know that they are all registered
9041511 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9041512 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9041513 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9041514 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9041515 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9041516 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9041517 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9041518 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9041519 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9041520 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9041521 we dont try to protect our data amp come up with new formats only for marketing reasons we use existing standards as much as possible and allow fl studio to be used as a plugin in other hosts
9041522 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9041523 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9041524 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9041525 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9041526 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9041527 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9041528 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9041529 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9041530 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9041531 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9041532 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9041533 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

9041537 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9041538 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9041539 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9041540 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9041541 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9041542 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9041543 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9041544 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9041545 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9041546 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9041547 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9041548 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9041549 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9041550 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9041551 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9041552 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9041553 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9041554 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9041555 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9041556 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9041557 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9041558 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9041559 who are open to doing something on the production side
9041560 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9041561 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9041562 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9041563 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9041564 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9041565 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9041566 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9041567 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9041568 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9041569 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9041570 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9041571 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9041572 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9041573 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9041574 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9041575 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

9041579 there is absolutely nothing i can do in terms of qualification
9041580 i cant qualify in the euro points list and i cant qualify in the world rankings list so as far as thats concerned i am as relaxed as they come
9041581 but i have been playing some very solid golf recently my focus is this week trying to give myself the opportunity to win the overall prize of 10 million and try and win a golf tournament
9041582 today i notified csu athletic director paul kowalczyk that we would exercise this option
9041583 we will continue a dialogue with our colleagues at csu on the future of this great series beyond 2010 but it is very important that we host a sixth home game next year to live up to our commitment to our fans and to remain consistent with the standards of our big 12 conference
9041584 forty four of the 66 bcs schools are playing at least a seven game home schedule this season
9041585 and four of those teams are playing eight home games including nebraska from our own conference
9041586 kiezen is moeilijk en ons leven hangt van keuzes aan elkaar hoe meer keuzes hoe moeilijker kiezen
9041587 mozes moest ook kiezen aan het hof van de farao hij koos ervoor om met het volk van god slecht behandeld te worden in plaats voor tijdelijk te genieten van de zonde
9041588 hij leefde immers in egypte op het mooiste plekje dat je je maar voor kon stellen aan het hof was nooit honger geld te over en je kon er een mooie carri re maken vergelijk dat nu eens met de situatie van het volk isra l dat in egypte als het ware in een concentratiekamp leefde ze zaten opgesloten in de twee steden python en ra mses waar ze keihard moesten werken en de helft van de kinderen gedood moest worden toch koos mozes voor het volk van god hij kon dat doen door het geloof
9041589 daar stak de dood achter van de zonde kun je genieten maar mozes besefte dat dit tijdelijk is en als je dat gaat zien gaat de glans eraf jongelui hebben wij de keus van mozes al gedaan waar gaat het je om wie de heere christus heeft leren kennen die zal leven tot in eeuwigheid
9041590 er was armoede en er moest gewerkt worden tegenwoordig is dat anders wat wil ik worden er zijn honderden beroepen maar ook wat voor mobieltje neem ik je dacht in tien minuten je keus gemaakt te hebben maar het duurde wel een half uur dat komt omdat iedere keus gevolgen heeft
9041591 want dat heeft gevolgen voor uw kinderen jongelui als je zelf had mogen kiezen had je dan ook gekozen voor het reformatorisch onderwijs want daar vinden ze het belangrijk dat je de heere leert kennen de heere zegt kies dan heden wie gij dienen zult ruth en orpa moesten ook kiezen voor orpa was dat heel moeilijk en ze ging terug voor ruth lag dat anders want ze had liefde tot de god van naomi ik hoop dat dit schooljaar veel leerlingen de keus van ruth zullen maken en dat de docenten de leerlingen daarin zullen onderwijzen net als naomi deed
9041592 ik haalde mijn vwo diploma gymnasium op de pieter zandt scholengemeenschap in kampen
9041593 volgende week start ik met het derde jaar van de studie werktuigbouwkunde aan de technische universiteit tu in delft dat bevalt me tot nu toe prima goed al is de studie wel erg breed ik vind het moeilijk om voor vakken als meet en regeltechniek en thermodynamica gemotiveerd te blijven maar van vakken als ontwerpen of materiaalkunde kan ik echt genieten
9041594 ik wil graag de uitvinderskant op om te proberen oplossingen te vinden voor energieproblemen van deze tijd wind en waterenergie leveren op dit moment niet echt genoeg op ook het fileprobleem vind ik interessant
9041595 ik zit in de kost bij een gezin in pijnacker lekker dicht bij de universiteit met twintig minuten fietsen ben ik er een goed portie dagelijkse verplichte lichaamsbeweging vooral s middags is dat lekker je stapt uit college met je duffe hoofd op de fiets en komt even later weer fris aan op je kamer
9041596 ja van het csfr dispuut johannes calvijn in delft daar bezoek ik de bijbelkring en de studiekring en volg er alle lezingen dat geeft een absolute meerwaarde aan mijn studietijd zowel het persoonlijke contact alsook de verdieping in de bijbel en andere goede boeken de keuze voor de csfr was belangrijk omdat de vereniging de bijbel en de drie formulieren van enigheid onderschrijft dat wil in een stad als delft al heel wat zeggen verder bezoek ik hier de studentenkring van de gereformeerde gemeente omdat ik het mooi en belangrijk vind om ook als student vanuit mijn eigen kerkverband te worden toegerust
9041597 ik krijg een uitwonende studiebeurs 480 euro is dat geloof ik daarvan betaal ik mijn kamer en verder het collegegeld de boeken en mijn zorgverzekering de vaste lasten kan ik er goed van betalen mijn kamer kost 200 euro per maand niets te veel want daar zit ook al het eten bij in

9041627 we think boeing has done much to avoid a strike which would be quite costly to both parties

9041660 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9041661 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9041662 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9041663 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9041664 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9041665 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9041666 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9041667 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9041668 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9041669 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9041670 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9041671 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9041672 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9041673 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9041674 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9041675 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9041676 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9041677 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9041678 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9041679 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9041680 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9041681 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9041682 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9041683 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9041684 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9041685 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9041686 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9041687 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9041688 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9041689 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9041690 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9041691 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9041692 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9041693 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9041694 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9041695 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9041696 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9041697 no one works for someone we all just work together
9041698 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9041699 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9041700 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9041701 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9041702 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9041703 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9041704 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9041705 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9041706 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9041707 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9041708 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9041709 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9041710 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9041711 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9041712 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9041713 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9041714 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9041715 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9041716 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9041717 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9041718 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9041719 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9041720 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9041721 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9041722 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9041723 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9041724 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9041725 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9041726 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9041727 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9041728 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9041729 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9041730 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9041731 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9041732 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9041733 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9041734 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9041735 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9041736 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9041737 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9041738 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9041739 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9041740 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9041741 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9041742 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9041743 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9041744 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9041745 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9041746 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9041747 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9041748 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9041749 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9041750 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9041751 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9041752 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9041753 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9041754 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9041755 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9041756 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9041757 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9041758 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9041759 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9041760 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9041761 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9041762 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9041763 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9041764 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9041765 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

9041769 as britains magnificent olympians returned home on monday they left behind a fierce debate in china over londons eight minute contribution to beijings glittering ceremony and in particular the performance of mayor boris johnson
9041770 its not that you are too old to be chasing teenagers around youll end up having a heart attack
9041771 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
9041772 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9041773 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9041774 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9041775 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9041776 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9041777 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9041778 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9041779 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9041780 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9041781 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9041782 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
9041783 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
9041784 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
9041785 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
9041786 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

9041805 data from 3 375 students at 56 colleges across the country revealed that after the legislation significantly more under age students drank compared to those of legal age thus the increase in purchase age appears to have been not only ineffective but actually counter productive at least in the short run

9041810 we have got jobs here because of the nano project now the agitation has put a question mark not only on the project but also on our jobs will the agitators provide us employment if the factory is forced to shut down
9041811 we are locals and have got the right to stay and work here strangely outsiders have raided the area and are driving us away from our workplace we are being threatened with dire consequences if we venture near the factory gates this is unfair
9041812 none of our employees attended work we are assessing the situation
9041813 unfortunately we have become pawns in the hands of politicians who are out to extract political mileage from the issue they have no sympathy either for the farmers or for us but in the bargain we are going to lose out
9041814 the movement will continue but we are not stopping anybody from entering the factory

9041834 whoah there is no way thats what the author intended even though thats the only valid way to read what the question says we should actually alter the question to what he really meant plane stationary and then ask
9041835 you are assuming that the speed of the plane is measured by the wheels and there is nothing that says that
9041836 basically im just starting out from scratch like i just got out of college
9041837 i was assuming i was going to have a policy covered
9041838 i mean you know theres a lot of money involved and no one wants to take responsibility and all the response i get is i dont know and i dont know doesnt help me rebuild my life
9041839 on a case by case basis were going through all of the files to determine who truly does have insurance who doesnt and for those that dont why

9041875 i had no idea and that sign isnt really you cant see it when youre driving and youre not going to come in and look for a sign
9041876 i am going home to long island and im about to fill up my tank
9041877 obviously the cheaper the better i dont want to waste my money on anything else when youre getting 38 miles a gallon in the little civic every seven cents makes a big difference
9041878 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9041879 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9041880 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9041881 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for
9041882 i mean undoubtedly at some stage before the end of the parliament he will want to do a reshuffle but im not expecting one imminently i do not think there will be a reshuffle
9041883 theres lots of people whod like to do my job and no doubt
9041884 yes i do think he can i do think he will
9041885 er well well its always difficult you know but gordon in september up to party conference has got the opportunity to do that and he will do that its absolutely imperative
9041886 ive kept out of doing this kind of interview you have to be quite careful unless youre one of those people whos happy to give everything of themselves and i for one am not
9041887 well thank god i didnt have to go there on millennium night
9041888 oh no you didnt have your collar all scruffed up like that for the pictures did you
9041889 becoming chancellor is completely different from any other appointment completely different even when times are easy its important because youre dealing with money and money affects how everything works when times are far from easy its even more difficult and we knew the economy was going to slow down
9041890 i remember i picked up the ft in the supermarket as you do and it had the european central bank starting to put money into the economy i phoned the office to ask why they were doing quite so much it didnt surprise me that money was going in there was concern going around but it was the sheer scale of it i said what about our institutions this was when northern rock started to figure
9041891 i received a phone call and went straight down to london from where i never returned that was the last time i saw edinburgh
9041892 this is a disaster this is terrible i said we have to search the place from top to bottom one of them said well start monday i said no we start today i phoned gordon up i said we appear to have lost two disks containing the personal details of just about every family in the country we knew it was bad
9041893 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9041894 theres got to be a life outside politics it was nice to go to the pictures and go for a nice meal afterwards one of the great pleasures was getting to edinburgh and going out for a meal with friends who dont do politics
9041895 the waiter came over and said too much wine in a loud voice so we stuck to the one bottle for the entire meal
9041896 well i think most people understand perfectly well that most of the problems they face are international however that doesnt help sell their house i was at a filling station recently and a chap said i know its to do with oil prices but what are you going to do about it people think well surely you can do something you are responsible so of course it reflects on me
9041897 no theres nothing more pathetic than people feeling sorry for themselves so you get on with it you just have to deal with it theres lots of people whod like to do my job and no doubt
9041898 frankly if you had a reshuffle just now i think the public would say who are they anyway you name me a reshuffle that ever made a difference to a government actually
9041899 and you cant be chopping and changing people that often i mean undoubtedly at some stage before the end of the parliament he will want to do a reshuffle but im not expecting one imminently i do not think there will be a reshuffle
9041900 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for but weve got a hell of a lot to do we patently have not been able to get across what we are for and what we are about
9041901 yes i do think he can i do think he will
9041902 well its always difficult you know you can always say what could you have done better and all the rest of it but gordon in september up to party conference has got the opportunity to do that and he will do that its absolutely imperative
9041903 were grown ups but no one likes to read nasty things about their friends
9041904 we were an ordinary family we talked about events but we didnt sit around the table having intense discussions about what marx thought
9041905 very different people but we had a very clear sense of what was right and what was wrong my father always thought conservatism was about helping people less fortunate than you my mother was very clear about what you did and didnt do she was very clear about saying thank you and being courteous
9041906 strictly bread and butter issues things like food prices in the student refectory
9041907 if you want to make any changes theres only one way you can do it and thats by getting into a position where you can influence things and the obvious thing to do seemed to be to join a party
9041908 just i suppose overall i thought the tories were unfair they were only for one side and not for everyone the labour party just seemed to reflect my outlook on life you know that we were better working together fairness helping everyone to get on rather than just a few the labour government in 1977 was in a terrible mess and i was getting fed up looking at all these things on the television and thinking god surely we can do better than that i wanted to do things but i was never really interested in the theory of achieving things just the practicality of doing things
9041909 we werent the ones who leaked it it had already appeared in other newspapers before and at any other time i would just have ignored it but understandably i was asked about it
9041910 then i need to deal with a whole range of things
9041911 yes all right but if youre going to announce anything in the housing market you dont do it in the middle of august its just a silly time to do it
9041912 i get very exasperated when people say we need to show people we are concerned its just the wrong approach i think theres not a man woman or child in this country who doesnt understand the problems people are facing people are not particularly interested in public demonstrations of your understanding you just need to get on with it
9041913 i wouldnt personalise it my criticism is not of him as an individual
9041914 why i think the tories are bad is different from why i think osborne would be a bad chancellor
9041915 i think my criticisms are of the tory party rather than him
9041916 the tories havent really changed they may have packaged things differently but fundamentally i think they are still very much focused on helping a few people and not very bothered about most people
9041917 there are times when i listen to cameron and im not sure what he does believe in i dont say that in any nasty sense i just dont have any sense of what if he was prime minister he would want to do
9041918 i think youre right george osborne is a politician and hes made an enormous amount of promises but its not clear how he would pay for them osborne knows what hes doing in terms of playing the political field thats why i say hes a very good politician because he takes his moment but whats his long term view of where the country needs to go what is his vision for the future what sort of country does he see britain becoming in the next 20 to 30 years i just dont know
9041919 half a dozen eggs that would be 1 20 i know they have cheaper ones i saw them but the ones my wife specifically wanted were 1 20
9041920 i much prefer to be doing things than shouting about them
9041921 part of politics is you do need to shout politics is the art of communication if you cant communicate then it doesnt matter if youre truly brilliant as a technocrat there are lots of people who are very good but they just cant communicate it
9041922 well it was the same reaction i used to have with the blairs thank god i dont have to do that
9041923 i mean it was probably an accurate representation of both of them i didnt honestly i just couldnt get excited about those pictures one way or the other i mean of course theyre both posed cameron was as posed as they come
9041924 but im not going to be hypocritical about it when ive spent 15 minutes on a beach being photographed in a very unnatural posture
9041925 thats why im not a great politician you know im not very good at looking at pictures and subjecting them to the equivalent of textual analysis
9041926 theres nothing wrong with the term its just not one i use
9041927 im not offended if someone earns large sums of money is it fair or not its just a fact of life
9041928 pragmatic i passionately believe in living in a fair country and treating people properly with proper respect and fairness
9041929 as a minister by and large i had a charmed life i was sorting out problems rather than being landed with them

9042030 she seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story
9042031 im sure that she will help make the case for republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket
9042032 he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him and his policies
9042033 the fact that she will soon be nominated is one more indicator of this country moving forward one more hit against that glass ceiling

9042069 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick
9042070 women voters are electrified and sarah is someone who is truly in sync with the way real american women think
9042071 she is a reform minded woman who will give all americans born and unborn the authentic leadership they deserve
9042072 governor palin is a committed and active christian who takes her faith seriously and lives her pro life and pro family convictions
9042073 she adds moral strength to the ticket this will go a long way in building important and strategic bridges for the mccain campaign
9042074 the majority of american women support commonsense restrictions on abortion adding palin to the gop ticket will resonate with independent women voters nationwide
9042075 by choosing the boldly pro life sarah palin as his running mate john mccain has taken his stand as the one true authentic pro life ticket
9042076 on the face of it it says if you advertise a service such as
9042077 requires that the information might affect a womans decision about abortion might seem to narrow down the circumstances when an offence can be committed but a given woman might say anything influenced her decision
9042078 is worded in such a way as to rely upon a subjective measure of deception or likely deception even when the information is factually correct
9042079 according to weekly averages of gallup poll daily tracking the problem seems to be with conservative democrats
9042080 the 63 of conservative democrats supporting obama over mccain in aug 18 24 polling is the lowest obama has earned since he clinched the democratic nomination in june
9042081 agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions but not by actual legislation or policy that directly reduces abortion
9042082 as the catechism and early church documents make clear abortion is always an evil that is an unchanging teaching
9042083 the question on when the soul enters the body was a philosophical question that grew out of a lack of scientific data at the time of st augustine
9042084 we have the data today which shows the embryo is human there no longer is any discussion of whether the unborn is human and so the philosophical discussion of st augustines time is not relevant today
9042085 speaker pelosi was correct in noting that catholic teaching has changed over the years even on the issue of when life begins
9042086 senator mccain made an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table sarah palin clearly addresses the issues so many conservatives are concerned about
9042087 we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives
9042088 i cant help but remember governor palins campaign slogan take a stand
9042089 her choice to value life in a very personal way speaks volumes and gives those of us in the pro life community in alaska cause to believe that we truly do have a pro life leader in charge of our state
9042090 when so many in our culture have chosen to devalue the lives of those who face special learning disabilities governor palin shines as a great positive role model
9042091 guttmacher institute formerly planned parenthoods research arm has documented the long list of reasons that drive women to abortion primarily lack of resources and support
9042092 guttmacher has given us our task list and they report half of all abortions are performed on college age women
9042093 we asked pro life student leaders across the country to see if they could find the resources pregnant women say they need
9042094 if pro life student activists who are not in a crisis cant find resources how do we expect pregnant students to consider choices like marital parenthood partnered parenthood single parenthood and an array of adoption options no wonder abortion is highest among college age women
9042095 there is nothing in this bill that planned parenthood should oppose
9042096 as millions of students go back to school we invite planned parenthood to get behind the elizabeth cady stanton pregnant and parenting student services act
9042097 sure its variously horrifying shocking and sickening and its obliteratingly stupid almost all the time but you gotta admit thats entertainment laugh at the nightmare and the nightmare laughs back

9042101 never in a million years i thought my daughter would have to have a heart transplant probably the toughest thing that i had to battle with is that i knew in order for my daughter to live another kid had to die

9042103 i tried to not let this overcome me because i knew i had a job to do and season was coming up

9042109 lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral this will show her true colors thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick

9042126 gustav is expected to be a large powerful hurricane as it approaches the northern gulf coast
9042127 given all of these considerations we believe it imperative as nasa continues the transition from the space shuttle to the successor vehicles that the means for producing additional flight hardware and obtaining additional flight engineering and support services not be completely and irretrievable lost through destruction or deterioration at least until a clear path to alternative launch capabilities is at hand
9042128 at minimum direct nasa to take no action for at least one year from now that would preclude the extended use of the space shuttle beyond 2010
9042129 the launch and the satellites condition in orbit all have gone perfectly
9042130 we expect to be operational in about 13 weeks the year 2008 therefore will be negligible in terms of revenues but our targets for 2009 are at least 20 million euros 29 5 million anything north of that we will consider a successful year

9042155 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
9042156 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
9042157 the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors
9042158 the last couple of years it has been pretty much the same i feel the same way bronco does
9042159 i just know from experience that until that contract is signed i will not announce anything
9042160 why because we have had discussions that have gone very far with other schools and i can say they are as far along as this but for some reason before that contract was signed you know there was a change
9042161 i talk with people all the time that are you know late late late in the game and then something happens and it breaks down
9042162 the thing about it is if i say we are talking to say mankato state and we dont get it done it is not a good reflection on the schools who dont get it done so the best thing to tell you is who we are going to play when we get it contracted
9042163 i cant say definitively that we wont play another division i aa team

9042170 mainly we are trying to understand the magnetic fields around the pulsar and the emission mechanisms that are making the pulsars pulse
9042171 the gamma rays we found are being produced by this cloud of high speed particles circling around the pulsar
9042172 yielding insights into the processes and mechanisms involved in making a dead star so active
9042173 the high degree and direction of polarization at high energies reported by dean et al provide valuable information on the site of acceleration of the particles and on the structure of the magnetic field associated with the pulsar
9042174 this is the brightest object in the gamma ray sky the one we have the most data for
9042175 the important thing we were trying to do in the first place is actually measure polarization because people havent been able to measure polarization to a good degree of accuracy before

9042183 so you know possibly a gas pedal got stuck brakes quit working maybe she thought she hit the brake and she hit the gas i really couldnt say
9042184 as a tourism community at this point we are operating business as usual
9042185 in a very sort of counterintuitive way it was a net benefit for the hotels in the area because of storm displacement and temporary housing
9042186 its not the way you want to boost your business but unfortunately its the reality
9042187 given the flight cutbacks and high load factors you may have a heck of a tough time finding a substitute trip that quickly
9042188 its become the norm that were always looking at potential events or significant weather coming through
9042189 its just become a way of life for us to have the ability to react to situations like this
9042190 with a sunny and clear forecast for the weekend we hope to have a normal labor day as people arrive on friday evening stay through the weekend and depart on monday morning

9042196 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9042197 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9042198 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
9042199 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
9042200 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
9042201 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck

9042213 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home
9042214 well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home and home
9042215 from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt now theres a pattern here barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president and he lost bruce babbitt ran for president and he lost now speaking for myself and for at least this next election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
9042216 john mccain has no problem hitting the snooze button on the economy because hes never been a part of the middle class and i would say to him sen mccain its time for your wake up call because we just cant afford more of the same
9042217 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
9042218 the question in this race is which of the candidates will make the change that will restore the promise of america is it john mccain no im shocked maybe thats because john mccain continues to claim that president bushs policies have been great for the economy in 2007 john mccain voted with the administration 95 of the time so if he is the answer the question must be ridiculous
9042219 even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
9042220 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama as the next president of the united states
9042221 i am honored to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
9042222 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
9042223 were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
9042224 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
9042225 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
9042226 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
9042227 youve been using hillary in some of your ads now why not pick her as vice president
9042228 nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
9042229 you havent heard about iraq or john mccain or george w bush i havent heard any of this we are a country that is in a borderline recession we are an 80 percent wrong track country health care energy i havent heard anything about gas prices
9042230 i guarantee on the first night of the republican convention youre going to hear talk about barack obama commander in chief tax cuts et cetera et cetera

9042270 the most effective leaders are going to recognize this immediately and prepare for it accordingly
9042271 the enemy is going to go where the people are so coalition forces need to be there too
9042272 people are where the fight is won or lost and insurgents are very aware of that if the people gathered at night thats obviously going to weigh into your tactical planning
9042273 attacks did follow a very predictable cycle which people i think are familiar with at this point
9042274 its an important step in terms of rapport building in terms of demonstrating who coalition leaders feel is important
9042275 it was a great opportunity to build up the stature of certain members of the community but also to build up your own personal power base as you work yourself in with them culturally
9042276 having good cultural awareness is as essential as marksmanship because its about the populace and its about intelligence
9042277 you can build trust so much more rapidly if you have demonstrated cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity
9042278 mayors and city council members for the cities with red light camera profit centers
9042279 revenue to be deposited into the county or city current expense fund from infractions issued under rcw 46 63 170 shall instead be dedicated to reducing traffic congestion and be deposited in the reduce traffic congestion account created in section 10 of this act
9042280 the balance of the revenue received by the county or city treasurer under this subsection must be deposited into the county or city current expense fund
9042281 if this were an organism it would be a symbiotic effect that we have through these different factors operating in concert with each other to achieve an overall more positive effect
9042282 we operate by with and through the iraqi forces throughout our operating environment
9042283 and so it is not us the coalition forces securing the iraqi population its the coalition forces in partnership with the iraqis securing the iraqi population
9042284 in the last year weve had more than 130 000 iraqis join the various forms of security forces
9042285 at the individual level the individual soldier or policeman understands what risks hes facing and he continues to serve and despite the risk continues to serve in support of his country and really in support and in defense of his family
9042286 at the national level there has been a significant demonstration of courage by the government of iraq willing to take on all of its enemies regardless of ethnicity or religious sect and that in itself has generated more confidence in the security forces and the government
9042287 its really a movement that does not have a national level consensus but its a local movement to provide local security for these communities
9042288 in doing so they took control of their communities back and of course theyve done so in partnership with us and more importantly within the past six months increasingly in a partnership with the iraqi security forces
9042289 in this society being able to defend your village and your home is a point of pride
9042290 because all of these previously unemployed military aged males are out there throughout the community earning a pretty good salary they now have disposable income
9042291 because they have disposable income everywhere you go throughout our operating environment youll see little businesses springing up
9042292 the security situation has enabled economic development where it could never take hold before and the same thing goes for development of governance from the local to the national level
9042293 we and our iraqi partners want to take full advantage of it and we are
9042294 were really seeing a lot of people asking for assistance
9042295 just like with other americans folks are looking for bargains and store brands and theyre buying things that go further maybe you havent eaten rice or spaghetti as much as you do now
9042296 you have a number of folks who come into the military and are making more money than they ever thought they would
9042297 the problem is they dont understand how much it is going to cost they dont think in terms of hard economic times they think in terms of how much money they have
9042298 expenses are never solid they move up and down all the time thats where people get into trouble
9042299 what im seeing is young people coming out of their parents home and they have no kind of background for dealing with finances
9042300 everybody wants everything now im seeing that change more all the time its the instant gratification generation they incur debt quickly because we all know how easy it is to get credit
9042301 when financial problems are introduced into an airmens life their mind might be other places and it can affect the mission
9042302 some clients i see have hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt credit card debt judgments it varies
9042303 you need to put that money to something you could use in the future
9042304 im seeing a lot of really nice cars on base corvettes brand new mustangs hummers thats money you could be investing
9042305 but 36 percent is still a lot and they really reach out to military members
9042306 people say i can afford to pay 115 a month what theyre not looking at is that they are going to pay back 5 000 on a 3 000 loan
9042307 military members are lucky because they have relief societies like ours
9042308 we see people everyday for whom something has happened and they dont have the money to pay for it
9042309 just having the piece of mind of having that money in your account is a good way to live
9042310 the servicemember is 100 percent responsible for paying off the balance of the card

9042317 dickson fits the profile we were seeking his athleticism strength and brand of football will offer a new dimension to the roster of players we have available in midfield

9042331 so besides football what else does everyone have going on this weekend
9042332 if its the fight that these dinosaurs want then it will be good fight to the finish i think that there could be a point where allegations that are actually through could leak out one touch of the button that goes out to the international press and certain people in the malaysian political scenario will be indeed finished it can be anyone abdullah najib and even pakatan rakyat as well well abdullah got whacked last week for calling bloggers evil and i wonder who would be the next person to become the punching bag

9042342 weve had a lot of requests for street fighter iv on wii
9042343 since its a 2d fighting game its doable but whether wed try we dont know wed have to see if we can sell it we might consider it and it would be a straight forward street fighter iv it wouldnt be a kids version
9042344 capcom if we do street fighter iv on wii its not going to be a kids version
9042345 if im still alive in the next three months we can talk again that opens up a whole other can of worms which is people instantly expecting it to be one to one swing controls and i dont know if wed be able to get it to the pinpoint accuracy that a game with this level of design requires so youd have to make gigantic surfaces you can swing onto rather than really tight skill based areas and that would shift more toward casual and bionic commando has never really be a game for casual players its one of those ideas on paper thats like yes the wii controller will work with bionic commando but when you actually try to design it out its like maybe maybe not i dont know
9042346 discussing the motionplus ive only heard internally what people have said and i dont think everybody is sold on it 100 percent maybe its one of those where the programming has to get better for us to see more and more specific uses for it
9042347 capcom bionic command on wii still up in the air
9042348 jason haists arrival in the u s was a complete accident after nearly drowning in rapids on the niagara river he and a friend washed ashore on american soil where he was promptly informed he faced charges for entering the country illegally and could be detained for up to three weeks while officials try to determine his intentions
9042349 jason haist who was put on an iv drip after having fluid pumped from his lungs said he could hear a border official using a walkie talkie outside his hospital room
9042350 he was on machines all night kerr said haist was discharged from the hospital around 3 a m and arrested shortly after
9042351 he told them i almost died i didnt plan on washing up on your land kerr said
9042352 the men will remain in custody at the buffalo federal detention facility until they can appear before an immigration judge
9042353 theyre here illegally ciliberti said because they turned up at an unauthorized point of entry a u s customs violation it doesnt help haists case that he didnt have any identification in his wetsuit all he had was his boaters card kerr said
9042354 ciliberti said the pair received notices to appear before a judge and explain their circumstances
9042355 ok so to put this to rest i was in the car went to start it before i was able to start the car began to roll backwards its a 2 5 ton car so i hit the brakes because the engine was not on the fluids that work the brakes were not flowing so the brakes were useless i rolled across mullholland dr and crashed through the neighbors fence dropped 85ft at 45degrees very fast hit 2 trees and narrowly missed going fully into the pool swerved right and slammed into the cement wall crumpling the car if it wasnt a bentley they said i could have been really injured
9042356 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9042357 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9042358 underline the anti semitic tendencies of the writers and the distortion of history
9042359 i was disappointed to see a great champion like him not make the top 10 in valencia during the european grand prix on august 24 where he retired on the first lap
9042360 he is motivated and we must work hard so that he is in a position to make a quick start
9042361 especially on the new circuits which i dont like and are doing harm to formula one you cant overtake and nine times out of 10 whoever takes pole position wins
9042362 a real test of a presidential candidates judgment is his choice of a running mate the person who is next in line to become the commander in chief
9042363 five reasons why sarah palin is a laugh out loud choice for vp its one thing for millions of voters to put forward a sitting senator as a possible commander in chief but for john mccain to hand pick a first term governor of a tiny state is bizarre here are five reasons why if she is the pick this is a huge mistake
9042364 during her first run for mayor critics complained that palin at 32 was too young and inexperienced
9042365 and they said that by posing for ads with the areas republican legislators who implied they could work better with her than her opponent she was injecting divisive party politics into what was technically a nonpartisan race
9042366 the high profile support from local republicans was hardly surprising however party officials say palin was already being groomed for bigger and better things even as she talked about sewers and road paving projects in alaskas fastest growing region palin was the fresh young face of the suddenly dominant republicans
9042367 just months ago when rumors surfaced that she was on the long version of the short list she was questioned if shed be interested in the position
9042368 until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here

9042375 in quebec access to public markets is the rule while contracts attribution without invitation to tender is the exception
9042376 a public market should be transparent fair and most importantly open to all the solutions as well as the propositions must be evaluated objectively on known and accepted criteria furthermore the regulation implies that public markets have to enhance the local economic development as well as the quebec technologies
9042377 another way to acquire free softwares is by coming to an agreement with suppliers for services contracts this solution should be preferred as soon as the expertise and the resources required are not available within the organisation in quebec there is still an important difference between the two types of softwares and free softwares are often put at a disadvantage the proprietary software commercial model based on the selling of the source code is sold as a product as far as free softwares are concerned the suppliers give the source code for free marketing instead their expertise and a wide range of subsidiary services
9042378 on the one hand the legal framework resulted in a situation of de facto monopoly with all the inconveniences that come with such a situation
9042379 when you buy a book for example you enjoy the book then place it in your bookcase you dont need that book to read the others books your bookcase is filled with a multitude of books all independent of one and other such is not the case with software every program uses components from other software programs every program will need to communicate the data it has processed to other programs its as if choosing the work of one publisher at first obligates you to buy all of his books and only his books in the field of computer science the consequence was felt immediately and it wasnt long before one software publisher whose only merit was to have been in the right place at the right time found itself in a monopoly situation in several market sectors dictating its prices and products to the detriment of productivity and free competition
9042380 we submit that it is well known that microsoft new 2007 softwares one of which is vista have only in common with the preceding softwares their function and the name of their manufacturer

9042383 exactly the type of leader i want at my side and the type of leadership we will bring to washington
9042384 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9042385 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies
9042386 it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9042387 women in america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9042388 so it seems the senator and his advisers arent as confident
9042389 an internet stock gamble very high risk and potentially very high reward
9042390 putting someone a heart beat away from the presidency who has been in office less time than mccain was in a p o w cell
9042391 ulcerate is really looking forward to calling willowtip home a label weve respected for a long time and whose reputation for quality bands and quality service is something we really identify with its feels great to have their support and backing
9042392 the philosophy of hiding my face never impressed me from the very outset
9042393 why are women asked to hide their faces our faces are our identity arent they that is what we are and how we look like why should one be asked to cover up her face this covering the face is what the criminals do what is the crime of a girl when she is asked to hide her face
9042394 girls in our surroundings are treated as inferior creatures no one takes them seriously a majority of the people think girls are naturally born to deal with household chores once they grow up they will be asked to get married at an early age occasionally without their consent involved that is the life for majority of the women in our society get married and look after the household
9042395 i objected to my fathers stance saying that he had spoiled me in the first place had i been denied education at the beginning i would never demand the completion of my masters degree by then i refused to spend a meaningless life like those of most men and women around me in the largely ignorant balochistan province
9042396 i will break your legs if you step inside a university
9042397 i insisted that if a university is a wrong place for the girls to go to then it should equally be billed as a wrong place for the boys therefore we should shut all of the universities if they are truly wrong place
9042398 whenever our relatives visited our home and asked about me my mom would either tell them that i was asleep or had gone to a friends home
9042399 back in quetta a girl like me was so much bound by tribal restrictions that one couldnt even go to a shop if one urgently needed to purchase a pencil all girls are absolutely dependent on their younger siblings the hostel experience in islamabad negated the much older idea inculcated in our minds that life for a girl is impossible without being dependent on a man
9042400 isnt it funny when you see a girl being escorted by her six year old brother who happens to be her guardian and protector
9042401 when men cannot compete with women then they resort to their character assassination most men claim to be the protectors of the women when they prevent them from going to school college or doing a job in fact they are spoiling them instead of teaching our women how to fight in the battleground the men are asking our women how to run from the ground
9042402 one of my close family members had accused me of disrupting the family honor because of working with male colleagues in the office
9042403 i face such experiences on daily basis each time i think of quitting my job i wonder why my parents have to suffer because of me every day i have to justify every working woman before the people who are opposed to womens jobs
9042404 if i give up patriarchy feudalism and tribalism will be the winners but i want the women of balochistan to win against this system
9042405 aug 29 2008 fridays at five summer concert series at jack london square aug 31 2008 farmers market at jack london square at jack london square we scour more than 20 local blogs and news sites to power oaklandnews
9042406 im developing shows for the disney channel and whoever wants it ive got some childrens stuff and i could possibly start working on a book soon
9042407 ive got a movie coming out this fall with cedric the entertainer and kel mitchell
9042408 thats called chicago pulaski jones and im happy to be doing that i did another one called black dynamite with michael jai white hes a friend of mine and we did that movie as well its a good meets the hood kind of thing and its in the can and ready to go
9042409 the main thing is all of the good things im doing for society and for people
9042410 im out there working with people it makes me really happy to be able to go out there and not only make people laugh and make a living but actually go out here and really help people in a world where a lot of people that could make a difference dont
9042411 weve never actually even played with one weve played with girls in bands but weve never played with an all girl band
9042412 i dont mind being in a girl band category because it does separate us
9042413 its weird though because i never think of us that way anymore
9042414 people still refer to us like that sometimes but it doesnt happen as often as it used to which is kind of cool i guess but when i hear people say that im always like oh yeah i guess we are all girls i just dont think about that anymore
9042415 were hoping to start getting more attention in dayton which looks so far so good we hope people come out for riverscape and yeah just be on the lookout for the cd
9042416 im trying to give young people a place to go where they can hear some music they dont always get to hear in public
9042417 i love what jay madewell does at pearl with leighties nite but its 18 and up there and some people dont like to be around the alcohol this gives them a chance to be in an alcohol free drug free environment
9042418 i call it rewind because with this particular show its kind of like a musical education class
9042419 im going from the time of buying out cassette tapes in the mid 90s around like nine inch nails in their height and im going all the way back to the beginning of 8 track im broadcasting the music at the ddc month by month as the music was released its kind of like going back in time to the beginning of the sex pistols in the late 70s
9042420 a lot of people really like a lot of soul music and some rockabilly type and oldies bands like the young rascals the beatles and elvis costello
9042421 im going to see if i can get people to dance to stuff like that i think its possible
9042422 open many more doors for creativity on my a part and for the other chefs that work with me
9042423 were trying to have some fun with it while raising money for charity at the same time
9042424 in considering the mccain choice of running mate one marvels at the more qualified more senior women he passed over in order to choose palin

9042426 tokyo is a shining star in the world of cuisine
9042427 we found the citys restaurants to be excellent featuring the best ingredients culinary talents and a tradition passed on from generation to generation and refined by todays chefs
9042428 there are a lot of great cities in the world
9042429 tokyo is an exciting place to eat but paris is an exciting place to eat so is rome
9042430 i dont think it is helpful to make that kind of statement
9042431 tokyo has the best japanese food in the world but it is nowhere near as diverse as other cities
9042432 tokyo ii mise umai mise tokyo good restaurant delicious restaurant
9042433 i think we can call it the culinary capital of the world
9042434 if you try any cuisine its hard to go wrong in tokyo
9042435 you can find many places that are not publicized at all but are still good especially when you are traveling rural europe
9042436 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon

9042462 el mercado se ha sofisticado tanto que cada vez resulta m s dif cil diferenciar a las marcas por sus atributos
9042463 las diferencias entre marcas del mismo sector se han minimizado tanto que los valores que transmitan las empresas ser n determinantes para que el consumidor se decante por aquella con la que se sienta m s identificado
9042464 no hay datos que avalen estas conductas en espa a
9042465 ya que aqu todav a existe un gran desconocimiento en temas de marketing y publicidad social muchas empresas se apuntan al carro porque est de moda pero no hay verdadera conciencia por parte de las empresas ni pol ticas que lo avalen
9042466 existe una creciente preocupaci n por c mo est el mundo la sociedad y el medioambiente algo que antes no era primordial

9042513 at the end of the day it should have been murder not manslaughter
9042514 if he did not have the intention to go out and murder he should not have taken the knife out
9042515 everybody feels sorry for that family but what have we been through
9042516 it bears no relationship with any form of justice that i understand can understand recognise or accept
9042517 weve got a man who has been murdered in the street someone has ran out into the public street with a knife and murdered a man and the judge says theres no literally no case to answer
9042518 i think what weve witnessed here is an outrageous betrayal of justice

9042539 our union has been in constant contact with mr lisiecki since the strike began to ensure that he is fully aware of the issues surrounding the dispute and we are confident he will be able to lend his expertise to the proceedings
9042540 now that we have received this request from the company the bargaining committee is looking forward to returning the negotiations back to the bargaining table
9042541 it is our hope that we will be able to reach a resolution that is acceptable to the membership so that they can return to work
9042542 the strike will stay status quo until we decide that it isnt

9042563 i am concentrating on my own game and physically i am fine
9042564 it was a difficult match so i am happy to be through
9042565 players like that have nothing to lose so they start going for their shots
9042566 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9042567 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9042568 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9042569 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9042570 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9042571 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9042572 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9042573 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9042574 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9042575 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9042576 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9042577 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9042578 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9042579 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9042580 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

9042614 and when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me shine on until tomorrow let it be
9042615 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9042616 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9042617 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9042618 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9042619 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9042620 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9042621 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9042622 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9042623 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9042624 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9042625 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9042626 dont worry bout those ghost notes they aint nothin but rebound to make it sound and feel good
9042627 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9042628 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9042629 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9042630 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9042631 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9042632 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9042633 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9042634 but one life to lose for my country but also his work as an educator the life size likeness of the 6 foot 1 inch hale a yale graduate at 18 and a champion broad jumper will welcome people with open arms
9042635 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9042636 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9042637 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9042638 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9042639 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9042640 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9042641 i tried to give them the pmu at the counter nevermind this should not matter anyway she said theres no time to process it please go ahead to the gate and board at once

9042644 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9042645 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

9042650 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

9043125 there is nothing new here such as to make us hesitate from the course we are taking given the urgency of the situations with which we are dealing and the realities already on the ground
9043126 we came to the conclusion it was just best not to have kids wearing those kind of shirts and those markings in school
9043127 were without two of our fellow competitors this weekend in toriano wilson and luciano ribodino what happened has made a deep impact on all of us
9043128 were all trying to recover from the tragedy our deepest condolences go out to torianos family friends and fans we also give lucho our best wishes as he goes through his recovery we will race this weekend like toriano would have wanted but well do so with both toriano and lucho in our thoughts
9043129 its exciting to race in front of my family and friends and hopefully i can put it on the box or at least get a top five this weekend
9043130 lately i have been qualifying better and i hope to see that trend continue this is really my first year racing and learning how to be a better racer has been my goal im used to the ktm rc 125 and once i got some idea on the setup its going better i have learned how to communicate what i need with my mechanic and weve gotten some good results ill really be pushing hard to get it done again this weekend
9043131 were all good friends off the track but its a battle royale out there on the track
9043132 it would definitely be cool for me to make the riders cup because i know red bull motogp rookies cup champion j d beach and it would be fun to race him and it would be great to meet some of the other kids too i think it will take more than just a top ten to get in the riders cup which for me is possible at this track its my home circuit but a lot of the other guys have been there too so that should make it interesting
9043133 im feeling really good i got the stitches out of my hand and i am super stoked to get back out there
9043134 ill have a lot of family and friends at the race and i want to get a top five for sure road atlanta is a really good track i like the way it flows and it has some nice off camber turns that are challenging there should be a lot of passing going on i have checked out the new section and it looks like a turn i would like a lot of hard braking down the hill
9043135 we have quite a few rookies that can earn one of the riders cup slots with a good result at road atlanta
9043136 i think well have more riders concerned about the points more than ever we have a tight spread for those last couple of spots it will be a challenging race some of the rookies have some experience here but they have never ridden the track on these bikes and the circuit is also a bit different

9043327 iman means to believe in allah his angels his prophets his books the day of judgment and taqdeer predestination and that all the virtues and evils are under his divine power
9043328 none can become a mumin one who has iman until he believes in taqdeer in such a way that he believes without slightest doubt that whatever has to come can never be avoided and whatever has nto happened would not have ever happend

9043331 o my companions of the prison i ask you are many lords differing among themselves better or allah the one supreme and irresistible
9043332 whatever ye worship apart from him is nothing but names which ye have named ye and your fathers for which allah hath sent down no authority the command is for none but allah he hath commanded that ye worship none but him that is the right religion but most men understand not
9043333 and they have been commanded no more than this to worship allah offering him sincere devotion being true in faith to establish regular prayer and to practice regular charity that is the religion right and straight
9043334 allah forgiveth not the sin of joining other gods with him but he forgiveth whom he pleaseth other sins than this one who joins other gods with allah hath strayed far far away from the right
9043335 most dangerous thing of which i am afraid about you is shirk e asghar smaller degree of infidelity or polytheism

9043342 when staged correctly both politics and pro wrestling can be mesmerizing
9043343 both professions tend to divide people into good and evil
9043344 for example to democrats republicans are heels while other democrats are babyfaces
9043345 both politicians and wrestlers are very hearty and the fans appreciate when each performs effectively
9043346 wwe fans are a sought after demographic for both political parties
9043347 both democrats and republicans respect the wwe and respect their part in voter registration efforts
9043348 political promises are much like marriage vows they are made at the beginning of the relationship between candidate and voter but are quickly forgotten

9043362 right wing ideologues who want to take away a womans right to choose
9043363 i sense that you have a strong sense of justice and i also sense that you are a fair minded person with a high regard for reason whatever your convictions if you truly believe that those who oppose abortion are all ideologues driven by perverse desires to inflict suffering on women then you in my judgment are not fair minded you know that we enter times that are fraught with possibilities for good and for harm times when we are struggling to make sense of a common polity in the context of plurality when we are unsure of what grounds we have for making any claims that involve others i do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion only that you speak about this issue in fair minded words

9043378 as a tourism community at this point we are operating business as usual
9043379 in a very sort of counterintuitive way it was a net benefit for the hotels in the area because of storm displacement and temporary housing
9043380 its not the way you want to boost your business but unfortunately its the reality
9043381 when we see something like this happen earlier in the week people will tend to look at other places other destinations that arent going to be affected
9043382 given the flight cutbacks and high load factors you may have a heck of a tough time finding a substitute trip that quickly
9043383 its become the norm that were always looking at potential events or significant weather coming through
9043384 its just become a way of life for us to have the ability to react to situations like this

9043386 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9043387 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9043388 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil
9043389 i cant believe you made us knock on peoples doors we even had a friend with us then you started looking in peoples cars and describing what you saw that was weird it was so embarrassing
9043390 hey lord i got it i dont need your help here
9043391 weve made attempts to talk to him and he hasnt been able to communicate with us
9043392 were going by witness accounts that the cars were racing
9043393 and once in a while like in the incident last night we suspect maybe the individuals just started racing each other but theres nothing to make us believe this was a planned race
9043394 i dont think so especially because her sister was going to give birth next month
9043395 i dont think it was racing if anything it was the other two cars and they got in the middle of it
9043396 theres not a lot of cross traffic and you could blow a red light and get going theres a lot of whipping down the street

9043400 as an iranian and as an american this is not just political for me its personal
9043401 if theres an arab american family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties
9043402 i feel torn because though he supports issues i believe in i dont feel he supports me as an american who happens to be a muslim
9043403 a visionary politician who truly has the potential to make significant impact for americans both at home and abroad and invigorate the average american and give them hope for americas future
9043404 i do wish that muslims stop identifying and get identified with single political issues that have little to do with our life in the u s such as kashmir or palestine
9043405 loves obama because he continues to represent what is best about the american ideal
9043406 the american muslim community needs to wake up and find common ground and work with sen obama we have too much at stake to let sen mccain win the election and not get involved in these last two months before the vote
9043407 american muslims need to stop whining and complaining and start engaging with sen obama so we can work to resolve so many issues
9043408 the american muslim community needs to wake up and find common ground and work with sen obama we have too much at stake to let sen mccain win the election and not get involved in these last two months before the vote
9043409 we really like it there weve been made to feel really welcome the kids are very happy at school the weather is great and we have nice friends there tom cruise is a really nice guy all our kids hang out together and we live quite close

9043450 he has a predilection toward use of three and four letter words whenever possible thats antithetical to the mindset that you need to use in wordtwist should you desire success remember every time you use all the letters its a 25 point bonus
9043451 the dual pronged approach that is necessary based on these settings examines both the depth and breadth of vocabulary as well as endurance
9043452 fortunately for me braylon lacks depth and breadth and his endurance is legendarily lacking inside these walls

9043454 john trevor has really let the fame go to his head
9043455 at one point in time john trevor was just a hard working man trying to eke out a living and take care of his family but now john trevor has had some success with his award winning high school football coverage and john trevor has forgotten where he came from hopefully hell remember soon
9043456 re assesses the things that originally made john trevor great
9043457 thats just part of the endeavor john trevor has lost his course
9043458 can he find it again who knows but john trevor will tell you this much its worth it for us to find out
9043459 for someone who hates gays as much as todd does it was really pretty gay

9043461 when he hugged me i was like whoa bro im not gay
9043462 and then he held on for a bit too long and i was like holy crap this dude is so gay i mean you can probably hug another man for like one second without arousing i mean inciting any suspicion but this hug was for like 1 5 seconds total flamer right
9043463 i am not nor have i ever been a homosexual of any sort
9043464 if my behavior in the locker room was perceived incorrectly as being fairy like then i deeply apologize to my teammates whom i would never want to subject to any sort of unfair exploration of sexuality or unwarranted sexuality based distractions i sincerely apologize
9043465 i just dont know all i know is what i see with my own eyes and before during his sob session and dry humping escapade around the locker room he was sitting in this directors chair and he crossed his legs not the straight way you know where you put you put your ankle on your knee you know the gay way where you cross your legs high like you dont have a penis so i guess that our relief pitcher is actually a catcher feel me
9043466 he cant stay here im not suppose to be around anybody else who is sick

9043476 era casi imposible detener las bengalas cuando tocamos en obras sanitarias hab a fiscales presentes y las bengalas pasaron igual es injusto que nos imputen esto
9043477 se ten an que ocupar de que no ingresara la pirotecnia
9043478 no verificaba las instalaciones porque es el estado el que lo tiene que hacer
9043479 irracional que le digan a un m sico que tiene que controlar
9043480 yo no ten a obligaci n de inspeccionar eso no es lo que dice la ley supon amos que los funcionarios p blicos no iba a permitir que se hiciera ingresar a m s gente de la permitida

9043485 esto no se origin por falta de cuidado o control sino por las bengalas el humo y el criminoso cierre de las puertas de emergencia
9043486 soy totalmente ajena al hecho delictivo que se me imputa y no me voy a hacer cargo de responsabilidades ajenas
9043487 porque una inspecci n es una foto de un d a podr an haber ido los bomberos y despu s de esto chab n colocaba la media sombra adem s el certificado no impide que haya bengalas o se cierren las puertas

9043499 spanish is and always has been the bedrock of the game of baseball
9043500 this move was not only necessary it was long overdue the level of talent you have is completely irrelevant if you are unable to converse with the vast majority of those in the game we will sacrifice some talent for the homogenization of our group of players
9043501 we have always assumed that the principal liga de b isbol had a commitment to diversity both on and off the field
9043502 this decision clearly shows a lack of tolerance or acceptance of minorities and is contradictory to the fundamental nature of the game
9043503 this ruling shows that those in the baseball world are fully aware of the importance of spanish to the game of baseball
9043504 it is obvious to any impartial observer that spanish is the one and only language of baseball and those who wish to play baseball must get on board with that program
9043505 im totally screwed i dont know nothing other than hola and donde esta and i dont even know what that second one means
9043506 it feels wonderful to finally know i wont have to have that awkward conversation with someone who doesnt speak spanish
9043507 it always made me a little uncomfortable dealing with people who didnt speak the language of baseball quite frankly if you dont speak the language you shouldnt be here
9043508 finally after years of watching nascar ive got something to be intrigued by
9043509 before this probation all we had was cars going around a track at 180 miles an hour gruesome wrecks on track
9043510 so you can see how it would be a bit boring thats why im so glad for this new probation system its really going to liven things up
9043511 we must insist on the highest standard of behavior and decorum from our athletes and drivers
9043512 our fans insist on nothing less i mean if we didnt do it what would we be saying about our fans that theyre the type of people who enjoy this sort of uncouth behavior and less than dignified human interaction no we intend to uphold the honor and dignity of our athletes and fans alike

9043515 the playnow arena is an open environment that offers something for everyone we see playnow uncut as the edgy version whilst the playnow music section is more a case of familiarity giving consumers something they know and are already comfortable with consumer experience is our absolute priority and we will continue to develop playnow arena as a service that appeals to all consumer segments and lifestyle trends

9043522 hi im from the internet and i have some information about your employee
9043523 as governor of alaska palin has enjoyed a strong working relationship with alaskas jewish community she has demonstrated sensitivity to the concerns of the community and has been accessible and responsive
9043524 palin has a proven track record of experienced and principled leadership palin has been a leader on the critical issue of energy independence and lessening our need to buy oil from nations not sharing american and israels foreign policy
9043525 palin is anything but the typical washington pick a former commercial fisherman and mother of five children palin is an exciting and vibrant leader she will bring a unique perspective to the presidential campaign her frontier spirit and triumph over adversity will benefit john mccain and the entire republican ticket

9043533 for the purpose of mutual support as we proclaim the good news of jesus christ in our own communities
9043534 the two parishes are developing a reciprocal relationship linking an inner city parish redeemer and a suburban parish zoar for both to become strong centers of mission and stand in the city for good
9043535 these two parishes will harness the gifts of both and mutually build up the body of christ in both neighborhoods
9043536 we do have all we need to do the work of mission outreach and ministry but its not always in the same place that is why mission partnership is so vital
9043537 the people in our pews on a sunday morning are the richest asset of the church
9043538 it is their lives and their faith and their understanding of the spirits work among us that causes the church to transform and be renewed
9043539 we understood that each congregation has gifts resources experiences and knowledge that the other does not
9043540 we both view this partnership as a way to be in mission in a different way together
9043541 redeemers members are committed to service in christs name and to being a change agent for their neighborhood zoar has a large membership of generous people who take mission seriously providing financial support and people resources for redeemer and two other elca congregations
9043542 putting our commitment into writing not only clarifies our expectations of one another it also provides direction for the partnership and it challenges the leadership and members of both congregations to participate in its implementation
9043543 historically congregations in the suburbs and in the city have had little to do with one another
9043544 part of that may be attributed to the fact that each ministry has its hands full sometimes it may be attributed to judgmental attitudes
9043545 it does not need to be that way for a number of years some of our urban and suburban congregations have met together to explore greater cooperation and sharing of gifts of the sake of a more vital ministry
9043546 the zoar redeemer covenant is moving this level of cooperation to a greater depth with greater specificity and greater mutual commitment
9043547 in fact the number of polar bears has risen dramatically over the past 30 years
9043548 our fear is that extreme environmentalists will use this tool the esa to eventually curtail or halt the north slope production of very rich resources that america needs
9043549 polar bear populations have not been increasing for the past 30 years and thats a well known fact
9043550 there is currently no way to drill for oil in polar bear seas without imperiling the polar bears
9043551 polar bears that come into contact with spilled oil will become coated with oil will attempt to groom themselves to remove it and will almost certainly die

9043564 as an industry we need to begin setting some basic common sense standards that reward pc gamers for purchasing our games
9043565 the console market effectively already has something like this in that its games have to go through the platform maker such as nintendo microsoft or sony but on the pc publishers can release games that are scarcely completed poorly supported and full of intrusive copy protection and then be stuck on it
9043566 this is an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to and ultimately so that we can provide our customers with the gaming experience that they have wanted for years and really deserve
9043567 the pc market loses out on a lot of sales because a significant percentage of our market has pcs that may or may not be adequate to run our games without the ability to return games to the publisher for a refund many potential buyers simply pass on games they might otherwise have bought due to the risk of not being certain a game will work on their pc the average consumer doesnt know what pixel shader 2 0 support means for instance

9043573 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove earwax called cerumen which serves an important protective function for the ear
9043574 cotton swabs and some other home remedies can push cerumen further into the canal potentially foiling the natural removal process and instead cause build up known as impaction
9043575 when cerumen builds to the point of causing symptoms such as pain ringing itching or hearing problems its a sign you should see a physician
9043576 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and include infections and hearing loss
9043577 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes
9043578 we are not commanded in scripture to send people to the doctor but to meet their needs through prayer and faith as anyone here in the ministry will tell you we are not against doctors for those who have their faith there and never condemn or restrict them in any way

9043591 liberal activists are fighting to make sure it is center stage during the presidential campaign
9043592 would be at the head of the domestic agenda this election year
9043593 i dont think any democrat can have a successful campaign and not address health care
9043594 it is important that the next president and the next congress make health care reform a top and early priority
9043595 in spite of the enthusiasm of activists and the rhetoric of politicians the left wing remains deeply divided about health care reform
9043596 if obama is going to triumph he needs to attract the middle class voters whove watched their jobs health care retirement savings and family finances grow less secure
9043597 this will only happen if he sharpens and expands his economic message without further delay
9043598 to do that he must put three moves into his economic playbook so far mostly lacking

9043638 to understand why marginalized populations are at higher risk of infection you have to recognize that these groups often do not have equal access to housing education health care clean drinking water or nutrition
9043639 marginalized groups also face discrimination and have less control of funding streams for health and social welfare purposes
9043640 enjoy rights and a quality of life much higher than do people in other nations
9043641 legal system acknowledges constitutional and civil rights but not human rights
9043642 void when it comes to advocating for the right to quality health care for everyone
9043643 without equal access to quality health care the epidemic will only continue to increase in much of the world
9043644 some societies are busy playing the blame game to avoid taking on their fair share of the systematic responsibility for infections the medical community aids service organizations and human service agencies around the world are in the trenches trying to save lives
9043645 we will never have enough resources to defeat this epidemic if we dont have the support of our communities

9043668 there is absolutely nothing i can do in terms of qualification
9043669 i cant qualify in the euro points list and i cant qualify in the world rankings list so as far as thats concerned i am as relaxed as they come
9043670 but i have been playing some very solid golf recently my focus is this week trying to give myself the opportunity to win the overall prize of 10 million and try and win a golf tournament
9043671 i was so frustrated with myself to be out of the position to automatically qualify that as soon as that opportunity had gone then that was it done now i am focusing on these tournaments the fedexcup stuff
9043672 i did think about that will i find out before or will i find out during the round

9043675 we are elated that senator mccain has chosen governor sarah palin
9043676 she is a dynamic and extremely popular governor but it is in her private life that governor palin has shown extraordinary strength of character

9043719 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
9043720 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
9043721 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
9043722 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

9043750 as an industry we need to begin setting some basic common sense standards that reward pc gamers for purchasing our games
9043751 the console market effectively already has something like this in that its games have to go through the platform maker such as nintendo microsoft or sony but on the pc publishers can release games that are scarcely completed poorly supported and full of intrusive copy protection and then be stuck on it
9043752 this is an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to and ultimately so that we can provide our customers with the gaming experience that they have wanted for years and really deserve
9043753 the pc market loses out on a lot of sales because a significant percentage of our market has pcs that may or may not be adequate to run our games without the ability to return games to the publisher for a refund many potential buyers simply pass on games they might otherwise have bought due to the risk of not being certain a game will work on their pc the average consumer doesnt know what pixel shader 2 0 support means for instance

9043802 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil

9043810 dizzees vision was further than mine at the time and our manager had to take dizzee to where he was going but he left us all behind i was in dizzees shadow i was naturally jealous of him and the label xl were focusing on him and not really concerned about me me and dizzee on the same label wasnt going to work there was a conflict of interest there
9043811 there was this particular mc man who was an older in my ends and i thought he was the dan my cousin used to say he was a p ssy undercover
9043812 he annoys me he looks at me funny hes too interested in what im doing instead of what he should be doing
9043813 maybe but i dont want to be a test case in court have you counseled employee written him up anything
9043814 i dont have time for that stuff ive got a department to run and i need team players employee isnt one
9043815 well we need more than that for a termination you need to talk with employee about what hes doing wrong document your meeting then well see
9043816 employee we dont like each other im your boss but youre always asking questions about why im doing something this way or that way i say its none of your business but you keep asking ive had it youre going to resign or im going to make your life a living hell i can always find something to write you up for it wont take long to have enough to fire you
9043817 look i ask questions about the way you do things because youre giving business to your cousins company when another company would do the same job cheaper id bet youre getting a little something out of that for yourself
9043818 you moron i get to decide who i give business to everybody in this company has special deals thats the way it works like i told hr youre not a team player and this proves it
9043819 no this tape recording ive just made proves youre guilty of violating the companys code of business conduct i reported this to hr the other day and when you called them about firing me they told me to tape record any conversation you had with me im taking this to hr right now
9043820 sir we have a problem supervisor is guilty of violating our code of business conduct and weve got evidence of it on this tape
9043821 i already know about this and youre making too big a deal out of it supervisor called me last night and explained what had happened he also explained what hed been doing its no big deal drop it
9043822 but sir with all due respect supervisor cant get away with this its a clear violation of the cobc if we dont do anything itll set a terrible precedent i cant believe he called you at home last night

9043830 the most extreme case of overlooked diversity is the morphospecies apanteles leucostigmus
9043831 each attacking one or a very few closely related species of caterpillars
9043832 one of the messages of this paper is that you really need all of these different kinds of data in order to tell the species apart that just using the morphology alone or the genetic data or the ecological information alone isnt enough
9043833 however once the species are distinguished anyone can use the dna barcode to rapidly and accurately identify one of them
9043834 this represents microgastrine wasps reared from approximately 3 500 caterpillar species in acg
9043835 since there are an estimated 10 000 species of caterpillars there including many unsampled ones that mine inside leaves or live in fungi this is just the tip of the microgastrine iceberg
9043836 we are not the first to make dna tubes with controlled circumferences however compared with previous approaches our method is distinctively simple and modular
9043837 the simplicity of the single stranded tile approach promises to enable us to design ever more complex self assembling molecular systems the work is simultaneously elegant and useful
9043838 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
9043839 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
9043840 we hypothesized that the low grade systemic inflammation present in obesity would augment the inflammation of asthma a synergistic effect
9043841 or alternatively that the inflammation of obesity might affect the airways independently an additive effect perhaps resulting in mixed airway inflammation
9043842 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
9043843 this does not change the fact that there is a well established link between asthma and obesity sometimes a negative result is important and the results add to our body of knowledge regarding the obesity asthma link now we need to look in other directions for the answers
9043844 we did not look at this in our patients given that asthma is immunologically driven this is a potential avenue for further research
9043845 alternatively it may be that dynamic changes in lung function that occur with episodes of asthma are different with excess body weight
9043846 an uncertain revolution why the rise of a genetic model of mental illness has not increased tolerance
9043847 in the case of schizophrenia genetic arguments are associated with fears regarding violence
9043848 in fact attributing schizophrenia to genes is no different from attributing it to bad character either way americans see those with schizophrenia as damaged in some essential way and therefore likely to be violent however when applied to depression genetic arguments have very different connotations they are associated with social acceptance if you imagine that someones depression is a genetic problem the condition seems more real and less blameworthy its in their genes theyre not weak so i should accept them for who they are
9043849 while the stigma surrounding mental illness has not diminished the rate of treatment for psychiatric disorders has increased
9043850 the culture surrounding mental illness has become more treatment focused with direct to consumer advertising of psychiatric medications now a mainstay of popular media
9043851 predicting how much damage will occur to oil platforms and rigs is a difficult task
9043852 these platforms and rigs may have sustained damage due to past storms and like anything else become more susceptible to threats of wind and storm surge
9043853 if one major deep water production platform is destroyed youre talking about a 1 billion or more loss
9043854 if its multiple rigs and platforms in a variety of water depths then were talking billions of dollars
9043855 more retail for during the day big end stores not so much the boutiques as they tend to have small selections

9043857 budget gaps are starting to increase the viability of public private partnerships
9043858 while i encourage you to engage in the political process please use good judgment regarding participation in activities that might violate state or local laws or the universitys student conduct code
9043859 this is clearly an attempt to scare students and is meant to have a chilling effect on participation in the protests of the rnc

9043872 a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform we need in washington
9043873 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
9043874 weve got to make sure the rest of the united states doesnt believe the only thing going on in alaska is fbi probes and corruption trials
9043875 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9043876 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9043877 it is a real role of the dice and shows how john mccain karl rove et al realize what a strong position the obama biden team and democrats in general are in in this election
9043878 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling i particularly look forward to the biden palin debate in missouri
9043879 i do believe that mccain has to do something to reshuffle the cards shake up the establishment do something unexpected and governor palin has all the kinds of things that mccain might see as a way to shake things up
9043880 i think it would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
9043881 and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
9043882 she will strengthen senator mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of senator hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief

9043895 the two most sacred documents in the world are the bible and the declaration of the independence it is better that a whole generation of men women and children pass away by a violent death than that a word of either should be violated

9043913 i demolished my kitchen and rebuilt it which was really therapeutic

9043915 ive learned to tell retailers what they should want and not simply listen to their requests it helps the brand in the long term
9043916 when i found out about it i felt like it was the end of my career
9043917 i wiped my mind clean and clear of the problem and came back with some clarity

9043928 if its a major hurricane i think that they certainly need to show they learned lessons from three years ago both from a policy and perception standpoint
9043929 federal response was castigated by state leaders as well as then candidate that fall the current president bush believed that the nation had dodged a bullet after hurricane katrina struck in only to realize belatedly that new orleans had flooded and his administrations homeland security apparatus was overwhelmed experts said that key for bush and perhaps for mccain will be the ability of u s officials to respond quickly to unforeseen problems and stay ahead of the unfolding events something they failed to do in the week after october surprise in september
9043930 public messaging and attention to the public affairs part of the response is going to get added attention

9043941 she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
9043942 she brings an excitement on the part of the republican base the strong conservatives really like her and you have to activate the base
9043943 he is also clearly trying to attract clinton supporters who want to see a female in the vps office on the down side there is no way in the world she passes the commander in chief test
9043944 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know

9043993 that is beside the point since random house had already paid a 100 000 advance arranged for book club publication and foreign publication it changed course and self censored solely on the political grounds of fear of offending muslims or fomenting violence

9044013 i have always defended the rights of cyclists to use our roads but it annoys me that when these days they have what we never had they should ride putting lives in danger

9044015 unless burien is prepared to make significant change in its proposal
9044016 burien has consistently acknowledged the role seattle has in the proposed annexation of the north highline area
9044017 i want to thank my management because without them we wouldnt be here
9044018 she brought it to my attention that when she opened her tray that she found maggots
9044019 the efforts burien has made so far have been stymied by seattle and king county to a certain degree because of preference for seattle to annex north highline but clearly seattle is not ready to do it to oppose buriens annexation efforts on the substance of annexation is one thing but to oppose it on procedure that we all know is going to change in 30 days is bullshit

9044048 governor sarah palin made history on dec 4 2006 when she took office as the 11th governor of alaska she is the first woman to hold the office
9044049 since taking office her top priorities have been resource development education and workforce development public health and safety and transportation and infrastructure development
9044050 under her leadership alaska invested 5 billion in state savings overhauled education funding and implemented the senior benefits program that provides support for low income older alaskans
9044051 during her first legislative session governor palins administration passed two major pieces of legislation an overhaul of the states ethics laws and a competitive process to construct a gas pipeline
9044052 governor palin is chair of the interstate oil and gas compact commission a multi state government agency that promotes the conservation and efficient recovery of domestic oil and natural gas resources while protecting health safety and the environment
9044053 prior to her election as governor palin served two terms on the wasilla city council and two terms as the mayor manager of wasilla during her tenure she reduced property tax levels while increasing services and made wasilla a business friendly environment drawing in new industry
9044054 she has served as chair of the alaska conservation commission which regulates alaskas most valuable non renewable resources oil and gas

9044061 in brief the city of burien has withdrawn its current request to annex a portion of north highline but plans to re file later this year we are still committed to the annexation process and will continue to do educational open houses in the north highline area including the open house tonight at 6 30 pm at the boulevard park presbyterian church
9044062 in the interest of having the community and the boundary review board focus on the merits of annexation rather than upon procedural and legal issues we believe that it is in the best interest of the parties for the city to withdraw its current notice of intent
9044063 weve tried to get seattle to the table for almost a year to resolve these issues but they have been unwilling to meet with us
9044064 for whatever reason theyve changed their mind now and appear willing to talk we wish for the sake of the north highline residents seattle would have come to that conclusion sooner but better late than never
9044065 we will encourage the north highline and burien normandy park fire districts to resolve their differences in the interest of providing quality services in the areas they serve
9044066 this move would not make a dime for burien nor cost burien a dime in that sense financially annexation as proposed would be a wash

9044082 its the same kind of misconceptions with what you see with viral marketing the misconception that
9044083 so were tapping into an existing fan base and associating ourselves with those brands and those widgets

9044090 we were tired and bored of seeing uninspiring slideshows online that suck the life out of photos rather than enhance the emotions in them the problem is that it requires expensive software extensive training and lots of time to turn your photos and music into video of high production value with animoto its free simple and requires hardly any time at all

9044095 unfortunately map only goes so far in telling you what was actually behind the expenditures
9044096 often the spending record data will dead end at professional services supplies or non contract purchases while its possible that some of these purchases are fairly innocuous the name of the vendor alone gives reason for taxpayers to at least question the expense the next step for map should be posting line item information from purchase receipts on the spending portal taxpayers need to see exactly how those funds were spent

9044099 theres also this issue that on april 18th she gave birth to a baby with downs syndrome children with downs syndrome require an awful lot of attention the role of vice president it seems to me would take up an awful lot of her time and it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child
9044100 thats a very good question and i guess my guess is that perhaps the line inside the mccain campaign would be if it were a man being picked who also had a baby but you know four months ago with downs syndrome would you ask the same question
9044101 were going to have to work with them to see what this means
9044102 the first and the foremost reason is that general musharraf earned a huge humiliation for the army during his stint
9044103 except 1999 the army never took over without public support
9044104 musharraf took over just to protect himself it was not an institutional decision but the problem at that time was that the political forces were divided and they supported the coup

9044107 it was a good way to finish the series but the indians played well and deserved to win it
9044108 credit goes to the boys for the way we came back we kept making mistakes through the series we were not consistent in the batting department
9044109 it was good to win the series with a game to spare
9044110 these tracks are said to be slow but the bounce has improved over the last few years i am happy with the way our batsmen have played the spin it was important to keep the strike rotating and our batsmen did that well

9044114 in a national commercial shawn needs to keep her taco to herself they probably asked
9044115 there should be easily understood reaction for every single action the player can perform and there should be easily understood reaction for every single event that happens in the game world
9044116 the important fact is that we are not trying to create a state machine or decision tree which is able to handle every single scenario in the game but we just want to create the most robust solution for the ai in this particular context performing the finite number of actions and responding to finite number of events
9044117 one way to visualize the asset requirements is to create a matrix of contexts and actions plus reactions if the ai is able to have distinct states like suspicious and alerted some actions and reactions may require more assets the matrix is a good tool to estimate how much work a new player verbs or new contexts in the game will generate

9044124 every time the united states has become protectionist weve paid a very heavy price free trade has been the engine of our economy
9044125 we believe this is a right step forward for the company in improving financial performance

9044137 these results show the strong growth in the groups profitability
9044138 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9044139 while we believe the earnings guidance is likely to put some short term pressure on the stock we do not believe it should overshadow the companys longer term growth prospects which in our opinion are still quite solid
9044140 everyone will know that when you come here it is public service
9044141 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible
9044142 the mortality benefits of influenza vaccination may have been largely overestimated
9044143 a striking and highly significant association to become attenuated and non significant
9044144 such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
9044145 the signs point to a hard road ahead in the quest for less biased estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness in older adults
9044146 mortality reduction with influenza vaccine in patients with pneumonia outside
9044147 benefits of examining influenza vaccine associations outside of influenza season

9044249 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september
9044250 despite steve jobs from day one saying the iphone was secure functionality and aesthetics of the device seem to always win out over security
9044251 apple quickly released updates to fix 3g connectivity issues this year but consistently takes many months to release security updates
9044252 even when a user chooses to physically secure the device with a four digit passcode apple has chosen to still permit the user to use some functionality

9044263 you will still be able to upgrade to later ie8 builds as they become available but you wont be able to uninstall them
9044264 if you have ie8 beta 1 installed the ie8 installer will automatically uninstall any earlier versions and then install the latest version of ie8 beta 2 for you
9044265 you will be prompted to reboot twice the first reboot is to remove ie8 beta 1 from your machine and the second one to complete the ie8 beta 2 installation

9044282 the 2 percent increase in total u s store sales was also more than entirely due to higher spending by customers from other countries
9044283 sales to new yorkers were below last year which should not be too surprising to anyone

9044292 the worrying part is the poor performance of the electricity gas and water supply sector which grew at only 2 6 as there are already supply side constraints to growth a poor show by this sector doesnt augur well
9044293 this is due to a slowdown in credit growth which came down to around 22 in the first quarter from more than 30 in 2007 08 this sector has certainly shown some loss of momentum
9044294 growth could be more hit next fiscal year due to the recent credit tightening that will affect growth with a lag

9044296 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove earwax called cerumen which serves an important protective function for the ear
9044297 cotton swabs and some other home remedies can push cerumen further into the canal potentially foiling the natural removal process and instead cause build up known as impaction
9044298 when cerumen builds to the point of causing symptoms such as pain ringing itching or hearing problems its a sign you should see a physician
9044299 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and include infections and hearing loss
9044300 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes

9044314 while millions of families are struggling to stay in their homes john mccain cant even keep track of how many he owns
9044315 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
9044316 im not up on the economy dont know much about industry really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class

9044326 to find an individual of interest in a mixture of hundreds or even thousands of peoples dna
9044327 similarly it might provide closure to families of victims of mass disaster if individual dna profiles could be identified from mixed samples
9044328 those are both two great contributions of genome science to society
9044329 we knew the implications and we worked with nih for a while
9044330 took all of this very seriously even though it really sounds kind of farfetched
9044331 so the unlikely but concerning scenario is that law enforcement has a dna sample from a crime scene searches an nih database finds a match and gets a subpoena to identify what researcher provided the cohort data
9044332 while a fairly remote concern and there are some protections even against subpoena nih did the right thing in acting to protect research participants
9044333 unaware that this technique has been used to compromise any information within nih gwas datasets
9044334 even if an individuals snp profile was found within a pooled dataset all that would be learned is that this profile was contained in the dataset and thus it could then be associated with the characteristics of that dataset e g disease or control population
9044335 access is granted for a specific research purpose for a specific data set for a specific period of time
9044336 our goal is to protect confidentiality of the data and thats why we took the cautious step

9044361 i was thrilled when joe biden was selected i think he can step into the presidency with one minutes notice i think hes very well qualified on barack obamas side to have chosen him as far as im concerned this was not a good decision in terms of choosing sarah palin
9044362 i feel very strongly as a woman as a person that the most important thing in a vice president is somebody who is ready to takeover should anything happen to the president of the united states and from everything i hear she would not be qualified to be president
9044363 beyond that being 44 years old and a governor are big pluses

9044380 i think we not only jumped the shark long ago i think were inventing new sharks
9044381 were taking it to a whole new level fasten your seatbelts
9044382 i t keeps it interesting first and foremost most other tv shows are in the habit of figuring out their winning formula and then beating it into the ground whereas we take what we already know works and toss it out the window at the start of every season which i think is very bold and ambitious and it certainly provides a new playground for the actors
9044383 that said ive been more comfortable with some seasons than others my favorites so far has been one and three because i actually think that my character works best behind bars with very real physical deadly obstacles to surmount whereas second season was a total change of pace and a real downshift for me and was one of my least favorite seasons because it felt as though my character was literally and figuratively riding shotgun much more reactive than active that can be frustrating but like i said its most important for a show thats running 67 episodes at this point to keep it as fresh and as exciting for the actors as possible
9044384 i think that michael is still a good man but at this point i think it would take something quite extreme for him to really even the score because in order for his brother to go free so many people have died in the process and i think that weighs terribly on michaels conscience
9044385 once this experience is over once say they successfully destroy the conspiracy there is no returning to his white collar existence as a structural engineer i mean i think the only thing that michael is kind of fit for at this point is as a hired gun which actually dovetails quite nicely with the directions he takes
9044386 well its not csi its not law amp order it cant run forever
9044387 i do feel as though we may be on one of our final laps around the track it is something that weighs on my mind from time to time telling a story correctly necessitates knowing when to end it at this point in the series michael and lincoln between them have intentionally or unintentionally killed so many people and yet theyre still running around with t bag its really a testament to robert knepper that his character has survived through four whole seasons but the man is a maniac a psychopath and a child killer and a rapist and yet he and the boys are still digging ditches together eventually you have to wonder when is enough enough because it really makes my character look bad these are the questions that i think eventually we have to answer or else suffer a fall off in terms of believability and quality
9044388 i think that we address it as plausibly as possible it helps that the show is kind of fantastic and i feel like weve gotten away with worse but at the same time we do provide an explanation and we dont tease the audience its not a flash of saras ponytail disappearing down an ally for the first episodes everyone wondering when shell actually make a face to face with michael shes back first episode michael and sara reunited and then the gang hits the ground running because theres work to do
9044389 the tattoo is addressed pretty definitively in the very first episode its funny it was a fan favorite the first season but then michael escaped mission accomplished suddenly it was just something that kind of had to be born rather than be something that could be used as a plot device that resulted in me in dallas in 120 degree heat wearing long sleeve shirts because were still pretending that i actually have the damn thing on i appreciated the tattoo and i think its addressed in the first episode of season four as something thats kind of emblematic of michaels experience that this is an experience that has left its mark its not something that can be easily washed off and it speaks to the fact that michael is now a changed man inside and out
9044390 i think id bring back paul adelstein i thought he was a fantastic agent kellerman and i thought was symbolic of the kind of character that the show does best which is someone living within the shades of gray not entirely black not entirely white not entirely good not entirely evil but someone who is complicated as we all are in real live i think paul really did a beautiful job of defining a character who could be vicious one minute and entirely sympathetic the next hes very much missed
9044391 its all part of an effort to green dc and restore its treetop canopy

9044446 much of the mccain argument has been to argue that obama is too young and untested this pick blows that argument out of the water
9044447 i dont think the obama campaign really wants to get into an experience debate with the mccain campaign
9044448 rightly or wrongly people are a little more concerned about mccains vp pick because he would be the oldest president taking office

9044469 he considered conserving the land as the best thing to do for the environment
9044470 if we name the building after steve irwin it would be a good move on the schools part the school would get publicity and that would make more kids want to come to this school
9044471 it helps the students identify with the building and if for no other reason it helps in public relations work

9044552 theres not too much more to tell about the copy mix but like i mentioned on the blog i loved what id heard of his before the bone thugs n harmony mixtape is incredible i guess i like the rich sounds and the driving nonstop pace and even when the beat drops out of the mix the synth lines are keeping it moving nicely and with the totally over the top chorus cut out it maybe gives the ideas in the lyrics a bit more room to breathe

9044703 and through the youtube video ive been able to target and reach a worldwide audience of hockey fans eager for a story about the sport they are so passionate about in six weeks my contacts on youtube have gone from about 130 to over 1 000 and my website mailing list and myspace contacts have both doubled in size as well my viral marketing campaign will continue through the rest of summer to hopefully continue to build a buzz for the book

9044783 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico

9044795 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9044796 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9044797 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9044798 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9044807 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
9044808 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
9044809 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos
9044810 ante el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios
9044811 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
9044812 m s que una carta pastoral es un libro con toda la fundamentaci n de datos y lo importante es que es la intervenci n de una figura de iglesia con preocupaci n por la tica
9044813 la escuela en un alto grado es una fuente de cultivo para el racismo la discriminaci n la negaci n de todo lo mapuche
9044814 los derechos educativos y ling sticos son parte importante de los derechos colectivos de nuestro pueblo naci n mapuche reconocidos por la legislaci n internacional en varios instrumentos convenio 169 oit convenci n de los derechos del ni o declaraci n de diversidad cultural unesco declaraci n de la onu derechos pueblos ind genas y que en el proyecto lge del gobierno no son expresados reflejando una vez mas la sistem tica pol tica de violaci n a nuestros derechos pol ticos como pueblo naci n mapuche por parte de la institucionalidad racista del estado chileno

9044820 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
9044821 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
9044822 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
9044823 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
9044824 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n
9044825 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano

9044827 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
9044828 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
9044829 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
9044830 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
9044831 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
9044832 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
9044833 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
9044834 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales

9044838 the team has distanced itself from his misdemeanour and has cancelled his contract with immediate effect until the b test ondrej sosenka has seriously broken the rules and above all damaged himself because for him this apparently means the end of his career
9044839 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
9044840 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
9044841 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
9044842 i feel a lot better now though because at least i know i will have a home to come back to
9044843 its like youve been slapped so hard in the past that you can almost still feel it i just know how much work it was rebuilding everything
9044844 hey he has the same scooter that i have mommy
9044845 no that is not his that is yours that he is riding
9044846 i dont want him to ride it either because he did not ask
9044847 im sorry i didnt know it was yours we were just sharing
9044848 where i come from taking stuff without asking is not sharing that is called stealing do you take someones car for a joy ride and come back and say i was just sharing hell no so why would you do that with my sons crap
9044849 i dont want them to steal my scooter why did they steal my scooter mommy
9044850 john mccain has chosen wisely in selecting governor sarah palin as his running mate john mccain has again demonstrated his judgment and his commitment to conservative values fiscal discipline and reform
9044851 i had the opportunity to meet with gov sarah palin on my recent trip to anwr i found her to be very down to earth and personable she is a person who would feel at home in southern indiana she hunts and fishes and is pro life
9044852 sarah palins selection is an outstanding example of john mccains willingness to reach out to fresh voices embrace new leadership and continue the republican partys strong support of conservative women leaders
9044853 instead of choosing a running mate who has the experience to be a real partner in bringing change to this country john mccain made a political pick in an attempt to reverse the anxiety republicans are feeling about his campaign rather than reversing the anxiety working families have about their future and their childrens future
9044854 we have taken this legal action against mr panagiotopoulos coach of ms halkia and all others considered responsible

9044857 no se ha registrado ratificaci n del convenio 169 por parte de chile en la oit chile no ha presentado los instrumentos de ratificaci n
9044858 todos los convenios de la oit sin excepci n no admiten ninguna reserva o declaraci n interpretativa
9044859 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9044860 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9044861 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9044862 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9044863 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9044864 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9044865 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9044866 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
9044867 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
9044868 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
9044869 michigan state is a very strong blocking team with very good hitters
9044870 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
9044871 p rez yoma rechaz duramente el ultim tum de agricultores de la araucan a
9044872 agricultores de temuco dieron 10 d as a p rez yoma para visitar la zona
9044873 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
9044874 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
9044875 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
9044876 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9044877 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9044878 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
9044879 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
9044880 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
9044881 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
9044882 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
9044883 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
9044884 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
9044885 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
9044886 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
9044887 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo
9044888 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche
9044889 los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche
9044890 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
9044891 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
9044892 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
9044893 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
9044894 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
9044895 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

9044899 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
9044900 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9044901 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
9044902 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9044903 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

9045014 the us and some european states promised georgian president mr saakashvili natos protection and have started supplying him with new weapons it obviously invites fresh provocations

9045020 this came along and theres just no appetite for it now
9045021 at the moment people are worried that the current crisis in georgia will make it harder to insulate the nonproliferation cooperation from the wider difficulties in the relationship

9045064 oh they are snobby there we have plenty of wealth in scituate but its not in your face like where youre from
9045065 a mind blowing music industry in a box friday aug 29 2008 2 01pm theres been plenty of press about the digital distribution of music and how online services like rhapsody level the playing field for major artists and obscure indie bands alike but how does an artist or band place their music on those sites send an unsolicited cd to sure one of the above might work or you can place your music with madonna take your pick you could record music you could manufacture physical product you could tour you could market and promote yourself you could do all that even without a record label
9045066 the one thing you just couldnt do was distribute your music you had to deal with the record label and the record label had to deal with the physical distributor
9045067 my thought was if i could remove this from being a gamble that is the label gambles on something becoming famous and successful to generate revenue and turn this into a democratized industry and let everyone in id probably be on to something
9045068 so i was thinking about this and i said why dont we turn distribution into a bottle of water
9045069 anybody on this planet can walk into a store and buy a bottle of water
9045070 youd think i was out of my mind but thats literally what tunecore is it enables anyone to have worldwide distribution for a simple up front flat fee we take none of the rights theres a 100 percent pass through the revenue we take no back end
9045071 not only do we do the marketing and promotion that one would expect with a digital store but we are also a portfolio company and we have a strategic partnership with
9045072 whats wonderful is im able to do additional marketing and promotions for example when you walk into guitar center retail stores you hear tunecore customers music being played and its being back and front sold through the in store radio when youre on hold the hold music same thing we do e mails each month that go to about 4 5 million people where we put together editorial staff picks of music and we provide direct links to buy them at the digital stores
9045073 it is our job to provide you the skills and tools you need to succeed or just take the headaches out of your life as an example for an established artist you can utilize tunecore literally for the price of a six pack and a pizza 30 or 40 bucks get that worldwide distribution and well do all your accounting for a year

9045107 artur played well for us last week and his attitude has been first class
9045108 i have spoken to him just as i have had to speak to a number of players you give out advice and if he doesnt take it then you have to become a disciplinarian
9045109 its not a new phenomenon people always lose their way sir alex ferguson has had to do it quite a few times at manchester united but hes not got a lack of discipline you will always get people who step out of line
9045110 all of them would change the dynamic of football and im not in favour of changing the game dramatically
9045111 obviously the referee wants to be seen as having the perfect game and if technology was developed to do that we would be delighted but equally the game is the game because of the way it is played and the nature of football being a dynamic sport
9045112 obviously the tv coverage and the media coverage is great at any old firm game but when we start the match our focus is on making sure the game passes off without incident
9045113 is he the guy who presents the sport on the telly
9045114 as a player its mostly other players that im concerned with and im sure the referee would prefer not to be the centre of attention especially tomorrow
9045115 well wait until tomorrow before we have a look at the front two
9045116 scott has the least chance of playing and jan has a better chance but we need to see his mobility they are big hearted both want to play but i might have to stop them
9045117 it would be great to have them fit because there are 51 goals between them thats a lot of goals to take out of your team but well get over it and its on occasions like this that your squad is tested
9045118 he has only flown in today so well have to wait and decide if he is ready for sunday well see how he is tomorrow especially
9045119 but i think it may be asking a lot of anyone to arrive like that and be involved in a game of this importance
9045120 most of our players have a lot of experience even the new lads and they will be able to handle a situation like this
9045121 they have been involved in important games throughout their careers including internationals so they will know what to expect playing in an old firm game is a great experience for any player as it really doesnt come much bigger than that

9045123 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience

9045125 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9045126 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same

9045197 the team has distanced itself from his misdemeanour and has cancelled his contract with immediate effect until the b test ondrej sosenka has seriously broken the rules and above all damaged himself because for him this apparently means the end of his career
9045198 we have taken this legal action against mr panagiotopoulos coach of ms halkia and all others considered responsible
9045199 at the same time the ioc declared its willingness to participate as a civil claimant

9045201 that was the biggest round of my career it was not the front nine i wanted but it was the back nine i needed
9045202 i was playing very well but the greens were ridiculous
9045203 they were really bumpy all you could do is hit a good stroke and hope it was really really disappointing

9045210 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
9045211 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
9045212 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
9045213 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
9045214 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop
9045215 we would much prefer to design a vehicle that provides good protection for unbelted occupants but is tuned specifically to protect occupants that are doing what theyre supposed to be doing
9045216 its very difficult for governments that have had a specific regulation on their books for many years to suddenly decide to change

9045247 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9045248 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9045249 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
9045250 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production

9045254 in other words allowing everyone not just web developers to remix the web so it fits their needs no matter what page they are on or what they are doing

9045260 our first priority has always been and will remain the safety and the health of that community and in the absence of a plan from sunrise someone had to step up and do the work
9045261 the surrounding neighbourhood was cleaned up very quickly and we will act now to complete the on site cleanup and bring the community back to normal
9045262 as with anything like anything around this the important thing is to do it right
9045263 it will take as long as it takes until we can ensure the safety of the community

9045268 puccini was quite an artist so it was no surprise that he was approached with the task
9045269 every time i pass that rock i think of puccini
9045270 exercise of artistic skill that would mark the entrance of the camp the date of its establishment and symbolic sword on a large glacial stone
9045271 i was assigned another pow to work with me having not much to do and being it was a pleasant summer we decided to do a little goldbricking and prolonged the enterprise for the rest of the summer
9045272 the rock is now in a prominent position where i hope it will remain as a memory of the time
9045273 this is not a question of whats true whats right whats wrong
9045274 the issue is those military judgments should not be second guessed
9045275 their hands were on that water pump and it should have been grounded
9045276 these contracts were meant to protect u s soldiers serving their country and we will not tolerate corruption that deprives the troops of the benefits of competitively sourced goods and services
9045277 we are elated that senator mccain has chosen governor sarah palin

9045287 the combined efforts of city staff architect construction firm and brs employees have produced a truly unique structure that will meet our needs for years to come
9045288 we had outgrown our previous facility which served us well for over 28 years so definitely needed to find a structure or build one in this case that could accommodate the aggressive plans we have for new products and markets

9045292 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff members
9045293 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
9045294 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
9045295 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
9045296 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
9045297 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago
9045298 dave thanks for the thoughtful comment and i dont really know much about the pandora issue

9045308 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero
9045309 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9045310 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9045311 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9045312 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9045313 of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that
9045314 hemos hecho un gran esfuerzo para contar con este bal n desde la jornada 7 originalmente se iba a utilizar en las jornadas 8 y 9 pero se hizo todo lo posible en conjunto con voit para que los esf ricos llegaran desde pakist n en un avi n privado y pudieran rodar en la cancha desde el 30 de agosto d a que se celebra la marcha por un m xico seguro
9045315 aunque la gran mayor a de los equipos jugadores y directivos del futbol mexicano por sus compromisos no podr n asistir a la marcha desde todas las canchas del pa s estar n unidos en este mensaje por un m xico seguro

9045319 no s lo hay que pensar en el invicto tambi n hay que pensar en jugar bien partido a partido y lo ideal siempre es sumar de tres en tres siempre hablamos de eso mantener el cero pero nos han convertido goles incre bles y hay que mejorar eso es importante tomar confianza porque el resto de la competencia es d ficil seguro que molesta que los goles te sorprendan el a o pasado estuvimos alg n tiempo con pocos goles y este torneo no hemos podido igualarlo pero estamos trabajando en ese sentido
9045320 se est trabajando para hacer un buen papel en casa y para continuar con la buena racha sin perder
9045321 tenemos el problema del partido pasado ante monterrey en donde no se nos dieron las cosas y en donde nos afect en parte el clima pero no hay excusas tenemos que repuntar por que ma ana es un d a clave
9045322 creo que es momento oportuno para levantar los muchachos vienen trabajando bien tienen un gran esp ritu lamentablemente los resultados no se nos han dado por una u otra raz n pero ma ana vamos a buscar a como d lugar sacar los tres puntos ante cruz azul
9045323 pesa mucho es uno de los equipos grandes de m xico no va a ser f cil pero tengo conciencia de que los jugadores tienen la capacidad para sacar un buen resultado
9045324 sus resultados est n bien est n consiguiendo los puntos es un equipo con reacci n lo vimos ante monterrey que iba perdiendo y le dio la vuelta y tiene jugadores de gran calidad y bien dirigidos por benjam n galindo entonces es un equipo muy complicado por donde se le vea
9045325 nosotros tambi n tuvimos un gran desgaste porque la cancha ante monterrey por la lluvia nos exig a hacer un doble esfuerzo al final de cuentas vamos a saltar once por cada bando a la cancha este s bado y el que est mejor ser el que se llevar los tres puntos
9045326 sabemos que ha estado lloviendo en todo el pa s para los dos ser n las mismas condiciones a nosotros desafortunadamente en el partido pasado nos afect por que en el segundo tiempo no se pudo jugar bien s lo se jug bien el primero en donde ellos monterrey sacaron ventaja ya que en el segundo tiempo no pudimos reaccionar por el clima
9045327 walter gait n todav a sigue con la cuesti n del est mago una infecci n todav a no se incorpora a los entrenamientos es una baja importante y se suma a la suspensi n de mario p rez

9045329 otro de los detalles que tenemos que corregir y de lo que estamos apenados es que en casa no se nos ha dado el resultado positivo hemos sacado muchos empates algunas derrotas y estamos en deuda y apenados con la afici n de aguascalientes y del necaxa en todo el pa s pero cada partido es una historia diferente y nos caer a bien a todos ganar de visitante y a un rival como lo es cruz azul

9045352 i personally would encourage them that having people from their church build relationships with their friends who do not attend church and invite them as their friend would be a much better strategy
9045353 they are appealing to the natural corruptions in unbelieving people the bible warns very explicitly about the dangers of greed the love of money being the root of all evil
9045354 appealing to the selfish motives of people is not christianity
9045355 we cancelled services that day and said our service to the community will be our service
9045356 this wasnt a gimmick hey come to our church there was no bait and switch we didnt try to convert people we just wanted to show we care
9045357 there are a lot of worse things that people can be doing in life than getting people to come to church
9045358 are they being tempted to think the church is about such gimmicks and external rewards
9045359 the only thing we aspire to in a new government in the united states is that it respects the dignity of the peoples of our americas and respects the sovereignty of our peoples of our governments

9045376 there are economic realities that we need to take into consideration as to what the prices are whats its going to financially cost businesses to be in compliance
9045377 we have several hundred bags that are plastic were gonna be using them up and come january were gonna be using ecologically friendly bags

9045388 the aclu has a right to file lawsuits and stand up for what they believe is right
9045389 my decision is based on a legal update from the supreme court set in may 2008
9045390 i can say that the courts have recognized some speech made by governmental employees that is not related to public concern and doesnt have protection of the first amendment
9045391 but his ban goes beyond forbidding that kind of speech his ban is so broad that it forbids people from speaking about manners of public concern that have been consistently found to be protected under the first amendment
9045392 obama may have recaptured the momentum he had lost in the last few weeks
9045393 think about the tasks he had going into this speech
9045394 i think clearly on the last two he did an exceptionally good job when he started defining what change meant it was the first time hes laid them out in detail the only area im wondering if he could have done a better job of is bonding i hate to use the old bill clinton feel your pain line i think the connection he made with the american public could have been better i think thats still a challenge at this point
9045395 started off slow but by the end the theme of unity had come across they projected the image of change and they made themselves out to be the party of the working class what will be interesting to see is there was a 6 point convention bump in the polls before obamas speech i want to see what the numbers are after the second thing is how many people actually viewed the speech because wednesday night the night of the bill clinton and biden speeches was actually the weakest in viewership of the first three nights we all presume that more people tuned in last night but how many people did watch
9045396 one thing was certain that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it it was the black kittens fault entirely
9045397 the body of water and so the sense became different and the expression
9045398 on his 72nd birthday senator mccain has chosen a vp based on her political currency rather than her ability to lead our country in a crisis if john mccain wins in november hell be the oldest president in u s history and sarah palin would be a heartbeat away from being our commander in chief its not only fair but critical in this case to ask if shes up for the job of commander in chief we just cant afford a gamble like this with our future
9045399 the selection of a vice presidential candidate is one of the most significant and telling decisions a presidential candidate can make john mccains selection of sarah palin raises serious questions about his judgment why when the country is fighting two wars facing an uncertain economy and an energy crisis did senator mccain make the choice that he did why with so many other qualified women and men in his party did john mccain choose sarah palin sarah palin is not the right choice she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade and continuing george bushs failed economic policies john mccain and sarah palin will not bring the american people the new direction they need
9045400 while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling i particularly look forward to the biden palin debate in missouri
9045401 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9045402 im glad to again to have several country stars join me on the telethon and im excited about the new online auction filled with many unique country music donated items to help mda

9045405 he was undeniably handsome but his bearing was cocky in a way i didnt like he also had mischievous eyebrows and a hawk nose with wide nostrils as if he was flaring them at all times
9045406 once or twice a year i type my name into an internet search engine i dont want to be overly sheltered from whats out there and skimming the results makes me feel as if someone is turning a doorknob inside my stomach
9045407 my younger sister neysa heyward encouraged me to have my work reproduced
9045408 she believed that i had a marketable talent and gave me seed money to realize my potential as an artist
9045409 i believe education in all forms is the key to being successful it takes hard work commitment and failure sometimes but you just keep on keeping on
9045410 parent would be about seven percentage points less likely to report being very happy
9045411 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
9045412 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
9045413 meeting the challenge to repower america will involve simultaneous work on three technical fronts
9045414 one get the most out of the energy we currently produce two rapidly deploy the clean energy technologies that we already know can work three create a new smart integrated grid to deliver power economically from where it is generated to where people live
9045415 the most important cost figures to consider may be the ones well avoid american utilities will spend roughly 100 billion this year on coal and natural gas to fuel power plants and more next year and the year after that until we make the switch to renewable fuels that are free and limitless
9045416 grid modernization with superconductor cables and other energy technologies will provide the capacity needed for the wide use of plug in electric vehicles

9045419 it will be interesting to see how the whole experience debate goes now too and something to note there is that while palin does not have much experience what she does have is executive experience which neither obama or biden have at all

9045507 oil vapour capture and recovery is a type of measure that serves well to support statoilhydros environmental ambitions the voc plant at mongstad recovers at least 80 percent of the voc emissions that were previously released into the air
9045508 a potential to reduce emissions existed at mongstad the new plant and sophisticated technology in operation demonstrate how this can be solved reducing voc emissions is currently a vital environmental concern and it is important that somebody is taking the lead
9045509 it is also a good tangible project that helps us in our targeted efforts to reduce harmful emissions to the air and environment
9045510 we have now seen that the technology works as intended its good to know that we are now part of the solution to a problem and not just the very problem the voc plant thus helps build a positive reputation for mongstad

9045515 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9045516 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same

9045519 the governor wanted budget reform to limit spending he gets it the governor wanted a sales tax increase he gets it the governor wanted deeper cuts he gets it
9045520 the only demand we did not give the governor is the tax break the tax cut after the temporary tax expires
9045521 a tax increase right now during this fragile time in the california economy should be the last thing we do not the first thing we do
9045522 its clear to me that increasing taxes will only put more californians out of work and delay the economic recovery
9045523 here we are on day 60 of an impasse in california

9045539 i am concentrating on my own game and physically i am fine
9045540 it was a difficult match so i am happy to be through
9045541 players like that have nothing to lose so they start going for their shots
9045542 the 5 0 thing puts a lot more extra pressure on us as it would take us up to second in the world rankings
9045543 that is the kind of pressure we want pressure is a privilege and if we win 5 0 it takes us right up to the top it is something we have talked about and if we deliver we can win 5 0 the dressing room is very happy place
9045544 we are putting pressure on their batters and playing to our potential were hitting their good balls for four and doing a really good job on them
9045545 i know south africa really well and they wanted to beat us they are very proud people and stubborn people
9045546 the cricket we are playing is not good cricket but england are playing unbelievable cricket they are one of the best one day sides we have played against recently
9045547 it has always been a dream to play for england as an individual you couldnt ask for more i played against south africa for the lions and although it was always going to be tough they knew i could bat
9045548 his recent form with the bat is another triumph for new captain kevin pietersen who has promoted the all rounder up the order and persuaded steve harmison a crucial figure in this series out of one day international retirement
9045549 that was the biggest round of my career it was not the front nine i wanted but it was the back nine i needed
9045550 i was playing very well but the greens were ridiculous
9045551 they were really bumpy all you could do is hit a good stroke and hope it was really really disappointing
9045552 oh well it is nice to be told what to do by one so young and one so inexperienced
9045553 can you believe he said that the only reason that we said a hotline to faldo is because he is the only one saying it
9045554 no one is he did say he has spoken to nick has anyone else said that no right then it is nick faldos decision
9045555 not necessarily i dont think that necessarily proves that you are on form or not a good solid performance does nowadays in europe if you finish from 10th up you are performing quite well because it is tough to win and you have to be fortunate at the right times
9045556 never in any of my 41 victories have i stood up and said i was unlucky ever
9045557 it was good a nice track and a great crowd
9045558 my start was not too good i concentrated on winning and as i am starting to get a cold i was not able to think about any faster a time
9045559 my coach told me that i should make sure to end the season healthy
9045560 but this was my best race with the best pacemakers the world record is now closer but im not sure i can do it this year maybe next theres still one race to go for the jackpot
9045561 i was struggling with that stroke but i managed to win at the end so that is the most important thing
9045562 i felt i had some chance but she had lots of heart
9045563 i played sometimes so well but then i made mistakes
9045564 i was not too bad i tried to go to the volley and put pressure on her but i felt my serve was not good i double faulted too much
9045565 i have no idea how she played what the other girl did i have no idea i only heard it on the news
9045566 so many advantages you know from her side and i also had i dont know how many match points
9045567 al principio me cost porque no lo conoc a pero a medida que fui conoci ndolo fui teniendo el control del partido
9045568 durante un rato jugu con mucho dolor despu s se fue o me fui acostumbrando pero jugu con miedo
9045569 i joke around with guys carl hes bff carl were best friends
9045570 i might text him later and well go get some in n out burgers oh wait he doesnt eat that stuff probably maybe salads
9045571 it means you cant do anything like what you did last weekend again
9045572 i do remember me having fresher tires and coming up through there i believe denny hamlin was with me kevin harvick and carl stayed out we got by those guys i dont remember touching him but i guess if i did repercussions at bristol is what i get
9045573 the first thing that i think of when i look at bristol is what happened in the spring of 2007 when i was racing with jeff burton
9045574 its kind of the reason why i didnt go back and play payback right away
9045575 i couldve very easily just drove off into turn 3 and doored him right in the left rear quarterpanel and spun him out
9045576 i wouldve certainly liked to have tried to have not touched him i wouldve certainly liked and wouldve rather not hit dale earnhardt jr at richmond add comment
9045577 thats the way it is its disappointing but its the way our teams have been its the way gillett evernham motorsports has been its the way our drivers have been you can look at the other dodge teams its the way theyve been as well
9045578 its disappointing but thats where we are at its the situation we are in weve come a long ways since last year and were working to get past that to start making more chases than we miss it takes time
9045579 i watched bowyer and ragan last week when i was out of the race and saw that both of them were having great runs
9045580 as far as this weekend if they race well and we race well were not going to make the chase if they have some races where they are a little slower and were good then well probably make the chase
9045581 its going to be interesting im up for it im excited for it well just see what happens i have no idea whats going to happen i think that we should have some really good cars i think well be really fast i look forward to that side of it
9045582 i feel like weve come a long ways since last year
9045583 we were going for sixth in points two weeks ago and ended up 14th two weeks later its racing thats the way it goes
9045584 i think that we have a good enough team that if we make the chase we can run in the top five of the points if we dont make the chase were going to run 13th in points its going to be disappointing
9045585 tough executive who demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
9045586 experience shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9045587 messily divorced from palins sister and disciplined before palin was elected governor for things like drinking on the job and tasering his own pre teen son
9045588 can you imagine if our administration would choose to shun any kind of national limelight and let them capitalize on some of the negative with the corruption trials
9045589 but its also a responsibility weve taken on changing alaskas image
9045590 we were down for about down for about 2 1 2 days with katrina then up and operating
9045591 we learned a lot from that experience and are setting up accordingly
9045592 i will not plead in line with my standpoint on this court
9045593 george responded to me i have already talked about this publicly that no one wants war
9045594 we had hoped that the u s administration would intervene in the conflict and stop the aggressive actions of the georgian leadership none of this happened

9045604 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
9045605 i know this is being thought a lot about in washington and at the white house and discussed and i suspect they will monitor it carefully and figure out what to do
9045606 he can come live with me he doesnt need that kind of crap in his life

9045609 we really like it there weve been made to feel really welcome the kids are very happy at school the weather is great and we have nice friends there tom cruise is a really nice guy all our kids hang out together and we live quite close
9045610 they are very positive the americans we get involved with everything our kids do and i think that shows were very happy with the way they have taken to us things just get better and better for me

9045617 our relationship with the administration of the township could not be better
9045618 they feel theyve overcome all the obstacles with this new plan
9045619 now i cant say that once weve done a full review there wont be other issues but i dont anticipate any based on what theyve given us preliminarily
9045620 this is a bza case and township zoning officer cara killkelley and i have represented it as nothing more than that
9045621 i think they had the same confidence the last time
9045622 were going to be doing this new bza application and the appeal in tandem and well wait and see what happens sept 18 although we have every confidence that well be successful

9045626 i think this says that america in the 21st century is much different than america in the 20th century
9045627 are now being realized in all areas of american life even the highest levels of elective office the presidency and vice presidency
9045628 the pipeline of potential national candidates is up and gubernatorial candidates are up
9045629 the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling
9045630 theyve become very good candidates but they dont run differently from other candidates they go negative at just about the same rates near as we can tell theyre just as tough
9045631 it is part of chinas worsening crackdown in the area
9045632 the international community should prevent the chinese government from carrying out their systematic crackdown policies on the uighurs
9045633 requires a rethinking of what early urbanism may have been like in diverse and variant forms
9045634 were going to need to make sure that the next person understands the size of the district we have understands the problems this district has as it relates to the growth of the students
9045635 we need someone who is going to continue the efforts the board has been making in terms of academic achievement
9045636 i think we need someone who really has proven skills in the business management side of running a school district we want someone who will be willing to learn about our community and our district and work with us rather than come in with a pre set blueprint
9045637 if there are folks within the district who have an interest theyll let us know
9045638 well find the money within our budget weve got to do that
9045639 im sure well build a contingency in for paying for that kind of service
9045640 i have an interest in making sure the transition is smooth and helping make sure the school board can make that transition any way i can
9045641 there are advantages to both there are people who are familiar and people who bring an outside perspective
9045642 immigration politics are a huge part of this years election
9045643 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
9045644 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
9045645 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
9045646 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
9045647 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
9045648 the city deserves credit too the department of public works assisted in the removal of the hundreds of pounds of accumulated sand that hid the original brick parking lot
9045649 neither our group nor the city is interested in an ownership arrangement that will become a burden to the taxpayers
9045650 those suckers in lawrence are doing what we dont have to

9045652 requiring or inducing a supplier or customer to not deal with a competitor
9045653 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
9045654 top to bottom reviews of all federal programs to weed out failing ones
9045655 things that happened in katrina after the storm made landfall are now happening before
9045656 what you are seeing is an entire culture change in how emergency management systems are going to work
9045657 weve all worked very very hard over the last two years in planning and training and assessing and exercising and being ready for the next big hurricane and gustav is going to be it
9045658 dr phil says that when you use the word but you are really saying ignore everything i just said now im going to say what i really mean
9045659 you cant do that you have to vote for mccain if youre going to vote for palin
9045660 would you say it was a sharp stabbing pain or is it more like a dull ache does it build up and then fade away or is it pretty constant how about when you move does that makes it worse or better
9045661 its not really indigestion and i should have dialled 999
9045662 ill tell you one thing cheetah it hurts like crazy
9045663 this development will cater for greater demand as a result of the projected increases in population
9045664 dublin gateway will also provide deeper berths that will enable dublin port to cater for the international trend towards larger more efficient vessels that require deeper water to operate
9045665 the port is operating at near capacity and notwithstanding the current economic downturn ireland needs to be prepared to deal with the upturn when it comes by having sufficient port capacity capable of handling the demands of an increasing population the gateway project is also consistent with the national ports policy which states that ports are responsible for ensuring adequate in time capacity to facilitate trade

9045667 it is considered that the proposed development of this viewing tower has the potential to significantly influence the landscape character of the town for the foreseeable future
9045668 the tracking of hurricane gustav indicates that alabama is at risk to sustain damage from high winds heavy rains and possible tornadoes
9045669 i am again urging everyone to take the necessary precautions to ensure your and your familys safety because of the high possibilities of damage it is extremely important to have a declaration in place
9045670 im very fortunate that i didnt get caught up in it it was great to stand next to tony kanaan on the podium first and second hopefully we can do something similar again
9045671 its been a year of ups and downs and drama
9045672 its either been something on the track drawing attention or something off the track its just been like that this year
9045673 winning hasnt lessened the pressure to win again were shooting for no 1 every week its the other drivers who are making it hard on me the competition is very deep out there especially on the road courses its tough every single weekend
9045674 every year at the end you think if it wouldnt have been for that one thing
9045675 thats just the way it goes but you cant control it everybody has their bad races everybody has their throwaways thats what makes a season
9045676 obviously scott dixon is kicking everybodys butt and doing a good job this year
9045677 its difficult to pass on any road course really but here its not like you drop a wheel off in the gravel and keep going or get pushed wide you hit a wall
9045678 theres just nowhere to go i did a couple of them last year but they werent pretty a lot of crashes end up happening when you try the only other spot you can make up spots outside of actually passing would be through strategy through fuel saving through pit stops i think a lot of us tend to rely on strategy for the cleanest passing
9045679 witten can be a third receiver obviously hes a force as a pass receiver
9045680 theres no reason you cant give it a colts look where youve got witten in the slot like they do with dallas clark wittens a force out there so he can be a third receiver if we need him too
9045681 he has been taken to hospital for cardiological tests as a precaution and will stay in overnight for observation
9045682 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
9045683 i as well as all employees of ferrari are extremely saddened by the news of the passing of phil hill a man and a champion who gave so much to ferrari
9045684 i never in my life experienced anything so profoundly mournful
9045685 without it i dont know what kind of person i might have become
9045686 but im not sure i like the person i am now racing makes me selfish irritable defensive if i could get out of this sport with any ego left i would
9045687 i think the positive is were going to know exactly where we are
9045688 when you play a team the caliber of missouri its going to give you an opportunity to know exactly where your program is and the things you have to work on
9045689 i remember a year ago we were fortunate to win
9045690 oh by the way they did go to the rose bowl i think they have a lot of impact players
9045691 you prepare for the season but theyve had that game in the back of their minds its a great challenge and a great opportunity
9045692 i dont think itll get to us this time around
9045693 weve got a lot of guys who have already played in a lot of big games
9045694 he doesnt give up on a play no matter what
9045695 if its a broken play hes going to find a way to get the ball out of bounds or make something out of nothing
9045696 how ironic that on his 72nd birthday mccain has raised the question of whether his running mate is prepared to be commander in chief and lead the country governor palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about his choice for vice president only reinforces that failure
9045697 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9045698 the eye is looking for something new and so is the psyche the dress has been done to death
9045699 i have nothing against pants or as fashion people often call them
9045700 this will be carried out under the condition of maintaining democracy freedom and liberties
9045701 in 2010 we will see a lot happening at the same time
9045702 we will see a greater penetration of diesel engines on the market more hybrids and more flex fuel all will hit the fan at the same time
9045703 chrysler has a few things up their sleeve that they havent told us about
9045704 this is the best plan to meet consumer demand and utilize our assets at michigan truck and other facilities
9045705 oh why didnt you do this ear lier because now we understand why you do this
9045706 a phone is only as good as the network its on
9045707 if people give you a shelter you should take it
9045708 gustav could become a major hurricane near the time it crosses western cuba
9045709 weve taken in all the balcony furniture all the pool furniture the marquees tied up what needs to be tied up cut down any coconuts

9045711 at 25 i turned out the light cause i couldnt handle the glare in my tired eyes
9045712 now what this got to do with the price of tea in china
9045713 theres no real light at the end of the tunnel for newspapers
9045714 its not clear where the revenues are going to bottom out
9045715 the cuts that theyve taken have not been able to compensate for the decline in revenue as the revenue picture becomes more bleak those cost actions have accelerated
9045716 online has not proven to be unaffected by economic conditions
9045717 they are making a lot of these cuts up front so they can be in a position to turn the organization around
9045718 theres certainly the risk that a number of newspaper companies could run out of time
9045719 before they make the transition online and theres no evidence that making such a transition is a certainty
9045720 were disappointed we will be appealing on a myriad of issues and we are going to fight this all the way
9045721 everything came out the word would be awesome from our standpoint
9045722 everything was clean there were a number of tests and josh came thought with flying colors obviously we hoped for that we needed to get some closure
9045723 if she becomes president of the united states of america i think we would have someone who is pretty fragile at the helm
9045724 shes number one an outsider smart articulate governor in a state that couldnt get further from washington
9045725 shes a person who finally can break that glass ceiling were proud to nominate a female vice president
9045726 i meant her political background she has no global experience shes been mayor of a town half the size of depere for two years and 18 months as governor we are talking about a nation at war
9045727 this is a clear measure of john mccains judgment of what one needs in preparation to be commander in chief
9045728 this choice calls into question both senator mccains judgment and a mccain administrations ability to lead a nation in crisis
9045729 barack obama echo chamber with the blinders wrapped around their heads
9045730 9news now at 7 hell be live in the studio with host anita brikman at 7 00 p m et to discuss john mccains selection of sarah palin to be his running mate in the washington d c area tune in to wusa9 at 7 00 p m

9045733 its that time of year when its not unexpected to find mosquitoes infected with the west nile virus in the boston area
9045734 my advice is always the same avoid mosquito bites wear long pants long sleeves use insect repellant preferably one containing deet and if possible avoid activities from dusk to dawn when mosquitoes may be biting most heavily
9045735 its also a good idea to make sure window and door screens are in good repair to prevent mosquitoes from getting inside your house
9045736 i go from from an ambivalent mccain supporter driven more by fear of obama to someone who can feel good about the prospects of a mccain administration
9045737 i love his choice i love his choice because i think she is going to bring to the republicans what hillary was going to bring to the democrats
9045738 we saw that he had picked her and we were trying to figure out who she is the first thing we did was to look up to see who this woman is it could be a good pick because i think he is doing it because hillary clinton is out and he is trying to get all of her voters
9045739 its an attempt to get all of hillarys supporters but i think they are different hillary and palin i think its an interesting pick i think it will work on people who dont realize how different hillary clinton and sarah palin are but it is not going to work on me
9045740 may these memorial plaques being unveiled today be a constant reminder to all of us that firefighter paul cahill and firefighter warren payne died as true heroes
9045741 paul cahill and warren payne deserve nothing less than our utmost respect
9045742 they were lost while serving the people of this great city
9045743 there arent many perfect men that walk this world i dont know of any but i know one thing is true warren and paul were perfect firemen they proved their willingness to sacrifice which is the cornerstone of what a firefighter is
9045744 everything came out the word would be awesome from our standpoint
9045745 these guys started yelling just these like homophobic slurs out their window
9045746 i am afraid to go out in my street in general now let alone it be at night
9045747 this sad incident shows us that homophobia is alive and well even in places that are normally viewed as gay friendly such as the south end it should be a wake up call to us all a reminder that we need to continue working together to promote tolerance education and understanding no one should have to walk down the street fearing theyll be attacked just for being who they are
9045748 we have to let 22 players go between today and tomorrow
9045749 were really not going to make an official announcement of who those are for reasons of competitive advantage i told the players that it was a tough decision and it wasnt over by any stretch of the imagination well try to bring some back as practice squad players
9045750 both of them have done a great job and we feel that both of them can kick in this league sometimes when youre in that situation the competition is so close you go with your gut weve got a guy who we think can do it well find out
9045751 all i can do now is go home and pray about it
9045752 i personally think i can help this team this year and contribute to wins
9045753 cu jocul sta o s ne fie greu n lig

9045757 we knew through early testing that he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives
9045758 we have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place we are truly blessed
9045759 we understand that every innocent life has wonderful potential and again im looking at him right now and i see perfection

9045773 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9045774 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches
9045775 breaking off diplomatic relations with tbilisi is not moscows choice and the responsibility lies with tbilisi
9045776 if european countries want to serve the foreign policy interests of the united states in my view they wont win anything from this
9045777 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
9045778 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
9045779 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9045780 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
9045781 my biggest concern with the income data is that were getting off to a weak start to the third quarter
9045782 the income numbers are a reminder that the economy is going to look worse before it gets better
9045783 traditionally september is a weak month for stocks and i dont think were going to escape that
9045784 i do think we are going to stay in a trading range i dont see this market falling out of bed and going below the july lows
9045785 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9045786 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9045787 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
9045788 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
9045789 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
9045790 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck

9045801 barack obama knows we must reduce our troops in iraq our brave and wonderfully heroic troops fools to me in the occupation of iraq and then biden praised the heroic families the husbands and wives of these supersoldiers who cant seem to make any military tactic they try work and biden went on to say we gotta take more poor soldier devils to afghanistan and on into pakistan weve got to find bin ladin and then you begin to see these clowns arent serious so why should i be except these failed military tacticians have convinced
9045802 an unexpected increase in raiding and in the killing and maiming of innocent men women and children
9045803 the deal thats all this business is about listen if paul newman comes in and says he wants to play gertie lawrence in star you do it thats the nature of the business

9045816 just a couple of drinks you dont have to be falling down drunk for it to affect you
9045817 it was a devastating event its something i still think about it if i get out there with a drunk driver i still think about that event and how it effected us as victims of that
9045818 it definitely makes me think twice when i see those drunk driving commercials and billboards and stuff

9045823 more than merely one sided it does not have a reasonable basis for its representation it is clearly unfair
9045824 i have always been driven to the desert i think the landscape itself influences people in a certain way
9045825 we experienced the desert and the sun and the extreme cold in the desert to the nonstop rain in oregon i think the weather and the landscape also influences the character
9045826 this is the exploration of the mystery of a woman called sylvia who has an emotional journey that takes her to the extremes it explores what makes her so damaged
9045827 you should ask people that question why are people so flawed because thats who we are
9045828 why is it when you watch a film and something happens that moves you it either moves you to tears or gives a chill down your spine its because we can see ourselves in that moment
9045829 there is something about kim theres a strength with her leftover vulnerability from her 20s thats just unbelievably beautiful to watch there are moments on the screen when shes shaking her entire body is shaking for real you couldnt act that
9045830 when they arrested him they located a backpack which he threw that had lots of change cigarettes lighters some car keys and two gps units
9045831 i found out he had already pled to the trespassing charges and was released already
9045832 we were upset we knew we had a bad guy we checked his criminal history and found that hed done 10 years in prison we wanted the system to slow things down he knows the process hes a career criminal

9045902 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment

9045999 no woman human or vampire had had my heart for many years
9046000 one time in particular we sat alone at a table in the lighthouse lounge chatting about ourselves nearby a man in his forties john also a werewolf began talking loud we didnt notice at first being so involved with each other the first thing i remember hearing was
9046001 ha womens lib no woman deserves that cook and clean and do whatever her man wants in the bedroom thats what a woman is supposed to do if she doesnt hell find someone younger who will
9046002 time passed letitia and i fell in love i knew loving a mortal could set me up for heartbreak when she grew old and died but i pushed that fear aside i presented her with a diamond ring she accepted not caring that our children would need special care i knew she was the one for me at least in this generation
9046003 no one knew quite how it started after a few rude actions leering looks and jeers from john the women refused to take anything more from him letitia avoided him completely one evening one of the women splashed her drink in his face
9046004 john twisted the girls arm behind her back she screamed out the whole roomful of people turned to look
9046005 ibrahim he looked the same then as he does now reached over the bar and grabbed johns neck he must have been floating to do it his eyes glowed red john let go ibrahim let go
9046006 this pig pinched my butt the girl cried to everyone
9046007 this mans been tormenting us ever since he got here who brought him here anyway
9046008 john i told you to leave your misogyny at home said one of the other werewolves several people chuckled a halting coughing chuckle this attempt at humor helped little
9046009 the crowd turned to the speaker ralph brows knit together
9046010 well we wont put up with it any longer said a woman its been going on for months you know the rules stick him in the caves
9046011 the hiss of gasps and murmurs showed everyone elses reluctance to do this
9046012 hell die in there said ralph ill teach him to leave you women alone will that do
9046013 please letitia said her soft voice was so seldom heard that everyone shut up and some even leaned toward her lets show him some mercy those caves the stories are too horrible at least from people whove lived through them maybe maybe hell be too scared to bother us women anymore
9046014 that night though after we parted and she went to bed she had a dream shadowy figures surrounded her in the basement of the lighthouse they chanted put john in the cave put john in the cave one said let us judge him you are not fit to
9046015 if you knew our mortal fates you would understand the intolerant must be judged our deaths must be avenged put john in the cave
9046016 she woke up crying but she thought it was just a dream so she wrote it down hoping to banish its terror from her mind
9046017 the next night in her dreams white shades pulled her with unseen hands into the lounge of the lighthouse
9046018 do as we say they said put john in the cave

9046309 by late 1949 the klo was reporting that the communist guerrillas represented a serious threat to the republic of korea rok
9046310 these reports establish the dominant theme in intelligence analysis from washington that accounts for the failure to predict the north korean attack that the soviets controlled north korean decisionmaking
9046311 learned of the attack six and one half hours after the first north korean troops crossed into south korea the telegram bearing the news from the office of the military attach in seoul reported fighting with great intensity started at 0400 25 june on the ongjin peninsula moving eastwardly taking six major points city of kaesong fell to north koreans at 0900 ten tanks slightly north of chunchon landing twenty boats approximately one regiment strength on east coast reported cutting coastal road south of kangnung comment no evidence of panic among south korean troops a message ninety minutes later gave confirmation general macarthur immediately informed washington and within a few hours sent the first comprehensive situation report on the korean fighting

9046313 the us air force cia relationship during the war was particularly profitable close and cordial
9046314 on 12 october cia office of records and estimates paper 58 50 entitled critical situations in the far east threat of full chinese communist intervention in korea concluded that
9046315 ussr satellite treatment of korean developments indicates that they assess their current military and political position as one of great strength in comparison with that of the west and that they propose to exploit the apparent conviction of the west of its own present weakness
9046316 moscow seconded by peiping with regard to the far east has disclosed through a series of authoritative statements that it aims to achieve certain gains in the present situation
9046317 it can be anticipated that irrespective of any western moves looking toward negotiations assuming virtual western surrender is not involved the kremlin plans a continuation of chinese communist pressure in korea until the military defeat of the un is complete a determined and successful stand by un forces in korea would of course require a soviet re estimate of the situation

9046340 they boiled it and them and two other family members were taking pieces out of the pot periodically and eating it
9046341 when miss edwards began to eat the piece she noticed what appeared to be a piece of grissle attached to the meat
9046342 so she took the fork and she pulled it off because she didnt want to consume it and she looked at it closer and it appeared to be a human finger
9046343 we havent had them tested until we knew it was human
9046344 but now that its been determined that it is theyre undergoing blood work to determine whether theres anything they may have contracted
9046345 i believe the odds of it getting into the oxtail from the process of how oxtail is done here and at the factory its very unlikely that it came from the oxtail
9046346 and we cut it and sell it frozen so theres another reason why i know that it didnt come from here because we dont ever refreeze it thaw it or refreeze it and number two if somebody loses a finger youre picking up that finger and youre going to a hospital
9046347 i believe these people and that finger was in that meat

9046359 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9046360 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington

9046401 john mccain first met governor sarah palin at the national governors association meeting in washington in february of 2008 and came away extraordinarily impressed john mccain followed her career and admired her tenacity and her many accomplishments she was scheduled for a high profile speaking role at our convention and included in the vp selection process because of his admiration for her strong reform credentials last sunday governor palin and john mccain had a conversation over the phone governor palin was at the alaska state fair and john mccain was at his home at phoenix previously rick davis john mccains campaign manager had also been in regular contact with the governor as part of the on going selection process this past week governor palin arrived with kris perry in flagstaff arizona on wednesday evening upon arrival governor palin and her longtime aide kris perry met with steve schmidt and mark salter of the mccain campaign at mr bob delgados home in flagstaff mr delgado is the ceo of the hensley corporation which is mrs cindy mccains family business on thursday morning governor palin and staff were joined by mrs cindy mccain and later joined by john mccain at the mccain family home in sedona arizona at approximately 11 00 a m thursday august 28 2008 john mccain formally invited governor sarah palin to join the republican ticket as the vice presidential nominee on the deck of the mccain family home

9046410 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september
9046411 apple quickly released updates to fix 3g connectivity issues this year but consistently takes many months to release security updates
9046412 even when a user chooses to physically secure the device with a four digit passcode apple has chosen to still permit the user to use some functionality
9046413 by selecting to perform an emergency call the user can then gain access to other options which eventually leads them to near full access on the phone never having had to enter that passcode
9046414 this is an exceptionable security flaw that is not an acceptable risk for many enterprises and consumers alike
9046415 until apple begins to publicly address these fundamental design development and process issues enterprises will remain skeptical of the

9046417 the cast i worked with had no cinematic training which i thought would be useful to access things that a professional actor wouldnt be capable
9046418 usually an actor is trained to show things i thought it was important to show what a person was hiding
9046419 right up to the day of shooting i hadnt found a suitable character to play that role and i even thought about cutting her out
9046420 as it is a very masculine and male oriented society the thought of really coming out and revealing that fact they wanted to come out and revealing they are not a real male has real problems all of the women i met who wanted to be male didnt want this to be known for them it was a real problem coming out

9046449 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9046450 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9046451 but i do believe there will be certain assets that as we are already looking at the picture right now well be able to recommend can be either redeployed or not deployed to the theater in the fall
9046452 every day they threaten me and want to drive me out of ossetia

9046455 emphasize the need for russian authorities to hold these militias accountable

9046470 we are excited about the upcoming race in detroit as our acura arx 01b is particularly well suited to street circuits
9046471 scott and david have both been driving extremely well and we are looking forward to continuing our battle with the penske porsches after winning three out of the last four races we feel we have great momentum going into detroit i am particularly proud of the way the team is working together and i attribute our success to their incredible efforts
9046472 its hard not to be really pumped heading into this weekends belle isle race after mosport
9046473 the patr n highcroft team is on such a great roll and we just need to keep it going belle isle is a very tough street circuit its really tight single groove in many areas and changing surfaces which all make it very difficult to pass however with the level of performance we have been able to get out of the acura im thrilled to return with a high performance prototype rather than an indycar the level of technology in these cars should really shine on a track like belle isle
9046474 we finished third in detroit last year and we know that the patr n highcroft racing acura is really strong on the street circuits so we should be able to put in another solid performance im looking forward to it
9046475 while winning the 1961 formula one championship was the biggest event of my career the 1958 le mans remains my favourite race and the most rewarding to me
9046476 it is a fantastic combination of fast and slow corners well use a much softer set up than last weekend at mosport moreover the detroit gp is roger penskes home race i hope very much that he has good reason to be proud of us on saturday evening
9046477 apart from long beach detroit is second in my ranking of city circuits roger penske turned the race into a five star event the grandstands are always packed and the atmosphere here is incredible
9046478 i was satisfied by how well we were running at mosport before the incident to go out at that point was a disappointment but the important thing was that we made further progress all round it was also satisfying that we found a good pace although many teams tested at the track earlier in the week and in fact we also missed out on the thursday sessions this is a development year using the races foremost as testing opportunities were not targeting eye catching results but we want to make real tangible progress at every race and this was the case at mosport now we have to carry this competiveness into detroit this week and face the challenge of a completely different type belle isle is a mix of concrete and asphalt surfaces and we expect it to be a bit slippery to start with but i think we can get a good set up for the race and the team has bounced back well from the damage at mosport
9046479 weve all worked really hard to get here and have the 18 car repaired in time for the first practice sessions which start on friday the logistics of being away from our miami base for most of august have been tricky and having to repair a damaged car this week has added to our schedule but we have a very strong crew under crew chief alex zaric and the guys have pulled together superbly as i know they would ive been coming here since 1992 and enjoyed some very good results so i hope we can get another solid one this weekend and this time load up an undamaged car at the end of it i must also say that the improvements to the venue made last year by roger penske have been excellent and provide a very welcome upgrade
9046480 im looking forward to this race i like street circuits generally and this one looks very interesting for sure i was disappointed not to get to drive at mosport but the car was working well there and its important that we are making steps forward for sure we had a good set up and race strategy but these things happen we have quite a way to go but we are going in the right direction and for me its both exciting and very challenging being a part of this big development project i enjoyed my time as a test driver in f1 and this project this year is very motivating for sure now were all focused on detroit and i hope to help the team to a good result on saturday
9046481 the race grand prix of mosport was going great the strategy went right and we were more competitive and as in road america the car felt very good the crash was bad luck for all in the team however the damage wasnt too bad so i was happy for the team and now im pleased to be racing in detroit thanks to the whole team and porsche that they managed the repair the car and get the parts quickly it will be my first race in detroit so thats going to be interesting i feel really involved and pleased with the team and im impressed by engineer roland wall i hope my team mates and myself we can show a good result like we wanted to do in mosport
9046482 it wasnt ideal for me at mosport as i didnt get a lot of track time in the car in practice and then our race ended before my stint however i hope that it goes better for me this week and i get much more cockpit time i havent driven on a street circuit before so im quite excited by driving here the circuit looks to be nice from videos that i have seen i hope i can contribute to a successful week for the team and we can all put mosport behind us

9046489 the criminal is not concerned with influencing or affecting public opinion he simply wants to abscond with his money or accomplish his mercenary task in the quickest and easiest way possible so that he may reap his reward and enjoy the fruits of his labours

9046492 international human rights law requires that the iranian authorities carry out thorough and impartial investigations into violations of the right to life such as those which were committed during the prison massacre which began in 1988 and continued into the following year and to identify and bring to justice those responsible the failure to do so to date and the time that has elapsed since the killings do not in any way reduce this responsibility
9046493 advertisers have described themselves as shallow flatulent obsessive incontinent hypertensive hostile older than 100 paranoid pasty plaid festooned sinister looking advantage taking and amphetamine fueled
9046494 ive kept out of doing this kind of interview you have to be quite careful unless youre one of those people whos happy to give everything of themselves and i for one am not
9046495 well thank god i didnt have to go there on millennium night
9046496 oh no you didnt have your collar all scruffed up like that for the pictures did you
9046497 becoming chancellor is completely different from any other appointment completely different even when times are easy its important because youre dealing with money and money affects how everything works when times are far from easy its even more difficult and we knew the economy was going to slow down
9046498 i remember i picked up the ft in the supermarket as you do and it had the european central bank starting to put money into the economy i phoned the office to ask why they were doing quite so much it didnt surprise me that money was going in there was concern going around but it was the sheer scale of it i said what about our institutions this was when northern rock started to figure
9046499 i received a phone call and went straight down to london from where i never returned that was the last time i saw edinburgh
9046500 this is a disaster this is terrible i said we have to search the place from top to bottom one of them said well start monday i said no we start today i phoned gordon up i said we appear to have lost two disks containing the personal details of just about every family in the country we knew it was bad
9046501 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9046502 theres got to be a life outside politics it was nice to go to the pictures and go for a nice meal afterwards one of the great pleasures was getting to edinburgh and going out for a meal with friends who dont do politics
9046503 the waiter came over and said too much wine in a loud voice so we stuck to the one bottle for the entire meal
9046504 well i think most people understand perfectly well that most of the problems they face are international however that doesnt help sell their house i was at a filling station recently and a chap said i know its to do with oil prices but what are you going to do about it people think well surely you can do something you are responsible so of course it reflects on me
9046505 no theres nothing more pathetic than people feeling sorry for themselves so you get on with it you just have to deal with it theres lots of people whod like to do my job and no doubt
9046506 frankly if you had a reshuffle just now i think the public would say who are they anyway you name me a reshuffle that ever made a difference to a government actually
9046507 and you cant be chopping and changing people that often i mean undoubtedly at some stage before the end of the parliament he will want to do a reshuffle but im not expecting one imminently i do not think there will be a reshuffle
9046508 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for but weve got a hell of a lot to do we patently have not been able to get across what we are for and what we are about
9046509 yes i do think he can i do think he will
9046510 well its always difficult you know you can always say what could you have done better and all the rest of it but gordon in september up to party conference has got the opportunity to do that and he will do that its absolutely imperative
9046511 were grown ups but no one likes to read nasty things about their friends
9046512 we were an ordinary family we talked about events but we didnt sit around the table having intense discussions about what marx thought
9046513 very different people but we had a very clear sense of what was right and what was wrong my father always thought conservatism was about helping people less fortunate than you my mother was very clear about what you did and didnt do she was very clear about saying thank you and being courteous
9046514 strictly bread and butter issues things like food prices in the student refectory
9046515 if you want to make any changes theres only one way you can do it and thats by getting into a position where you can influence things and the obvious thing to do seemed to be to join a party
9046516 just i suppose overall i thought the tories were unfair they were only for one side and not for everyone the labour party just seemed to reflect my outlook on life you know that we were better working together fairness helping everyone to get on rather than just a few the labour government in 1977 was in a terrible mess and i was getting fed up looking at all these things on the television and thinking god surely we can do better than that i wanted to do things but i was never really interested in the theory of achieving things just the practicality of doing things
9046517 we werent the ones who leaked it it had already appeared in other newspapers before and at any other time i would just have ignored it but understandably i was asked about it
9046518 then i need to deal with a whole range of things
9046519 yes all right but if youre going to announce anything in the housing market you dont do it in the middle of august its just a silly time to do it
9046520 i get very exasperated when people say we need to show people we are concerned its just the wrong approach i think theres not a man woman or child in this country who doesnt understand the problems people are facing people are not particularly interested in public demonstrations of your understanding you just need to get on with it
9046521 i wouldnt personalise it my criticism is not of him as an individual
9046522 why i think the tories are bad is different from why i think osborne would be a bad chancellor
9046523 i think my criticisms are of the tory party rather than him
9046524 the tories havent really changed they may have packaged things differently but fundamentally i think they are still very much focused on helping a few people and not very bothered about most people
9046525 there are times when i listen to cameron and im not sure what he does believe in i dont say that in any nasty sense i just dont have any sense of what if he was prime minister he would want to do
9046526 i think youre right george osborne is a politician and hes made an enormous amount of promises but its not clear how he would pay for them osborne knows what hes doing in terms of playing the political field thats why i say hes a very good politician because he takes his moment but whats his long term view of where the country needs to go what is his vision for the future what sort of country does he see britain becoming in the next 20 to 30 years i just dont know
9046527 half a dozen eggs that would be 1 20 i know they have cheaper ones i saw them but the ones my wife specifically wanted were 1 20
9046528 i much prefer to be doing things than shouting about them
9046529 part of politics is you do need to shout politics is the art of communication if you cant communicate then it doesnt matter if youre truly brilliant as a technocrat there are lots of people who are very good but they just cant communicate it
9046530 well it was the same reaction i used to have with the blairs thank god i dont have to do that
9046531 i mean it was probably an accurate representation of both of them i didnt honestly i just couldnt get excited about those pictures one way or the other i mean of course theyre both posed cameron was as posed as they come
9046532 but im not going to be hypocritical about it when ive spent 15 minutes on a beach being photographed in a very unnatural posture
9046533 thats why im not a great politician you know im not very good at looking at pictures and subjecting them to the equivalent of textual analysis
9046534 theres nothing wrong with the term its just not one i use
9046535 im not offended if someone earns large sums of money is it fair or not its just a fact of life
9046536 pragmatic i passionately believe in living in a fair country and treating people properly with proper respect and fairness
9046537 as a minister by and large i had a charmed life i was sorting out problems rather than being landed with them
9046538 the fruits from which jams are made vary in their content of sugar acid and pectin a natural gum like substance all three of these make an essential contribution to the set and finished results
9046539 we had commitments from three teams that expected to play in this tournament and it was important for us to fulfill that obligation
9046540 we were very fortunate that the people from the sears centre opened their doors for us to maintain this tournament the chicago area is a second home to notre dame and hopefully this can help develop into a relationship that will allow us to play games in chicago on an annual basis
9046541 i am extremely disappointed in the tampa bay lightings decision to not continue the tournament we had a verbal agreement to continue this for two more years and as hosts of the frozen four in 2012 im not sure its the best message to send to the college hockey community by cancelling the tournament at such a late date

9046549 wildcard ruthless and cunning has capability to target u s forces and make it look like a palestinian arab act
9046550 syrian army quantitatively larger than israeli defense forces but largely seen as qualitatively inferior more likely however syrians would provide financial and political support to the palestinians as well as increase covert support to terrorism acts through lebanon
9046551 egyptians also maintain a large army but have little to gain by attacking israel
9046552 create conditions for development of palestinian state and security of israel
9046553 encourage reconciliation between entities based on acceptance of new national identities
9046554 build lasting relationship based on new legal borders and not religious territorial claims
9046555 they screen their records and there are several tests they go through before they are accepted by the program the bright planners of the future come out of this program
9046556 in general the bush administration policy is to discourage a large american presence
9046557 but it has been rumored that one of the possibilities might be an expanded cia role
9046558 the palestinian authority is pushing for this as part of its strategy to internationalize the conflict bring in the europeans and russia and china but such monitors or peacekeeping forces are not going to be able to bring peace only a decision by the palestinians to stop the violence and restart talks could possibly do that
9046559 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9046560 the regional countries are able to resolve the issue if countries from outside the region do not interfere in the case
9046561 the islamic republic enjoys a friendly relation with all the regional nations and has deep ties with georgians too but such a conflict would never have happened if georgian authorities had not allowed countries from outside the region to interfere in their internal affairs
9046562 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

9046565 if it is the spider they believe it is then normally they dont attack humans but they could give a painful bite
9046566 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9046567 this would be a helluva lot easier if this was a dictatorship

9046574 i cant put into words how ecstatic and honored we feel to be the first production in new york of rent subsequent to its closure on broadway
9046575 its our testimony to jonathan his work and all of our theatre alumni
9046576 i am absolutely thrilled to be returning to adelphi after 26 years to share my jonathan stories with our amazing cast
9046577 it is a palpable rush to direct the first full new production of rent to be seen in 12 years
9046578 jonathan was one of my closest friends pretty much from the moment we met at adelphi
9046579 we continued our friendship and creative relationship as roommates in college and later in new york and far beyond in those early days trying to survive and be heard as artists in a climate of disease fear and political neglect was difficult for all of us so i understood completely what jonathan was writing about we all did the existential questions of expression and survival raised in rent are as potent today as they were in the early 90s therefore i consider it a privilege to play a small role the continuing legacies of both arsons work and theatre department of adelphi university
9046580 the creative team is in a unique position to bring not only our personal experience of the zeitgeist of the late 80s and early 90s but also our experience of having been a part of jonathans life during his formative years at adelphi in essence we are living bridges connecting todays performing arts majors to the unique history we all shared with jonathan
9046581 the insight of jonathans music and lyrics to embrace rent with physical accents that inform the human condition worldly events and attitudes prevalent today i am honored to be a part of this production

9046589 efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
9046590 it would have been very important to have gotten direct support from these states which very closely work and depend on russia but moscow didnt get any support aside from general statements
9046591 even if it is eager to support russia in its conflict with the west and this is not clear china is not eager to somehow put at risk its own problems with succession and regions

9046604 i hope to win and play well also so i can play in the france team
9046605 the choice since i was young to play for monaco didnt take me into the limelight as would have happened if i had chosen a squad of international importance
9046606 to win something is the dream of all footballers but you have to work and train a lot to improve
9046607 im not scared of training hard only like that can you improve im not at all scared
9046608 but now everything is all right i was operated on in june and i overcame the following period fine

9046611 among the others that were interested was manchester united they made enquiries about me to my agents but it was only an enquiry
9046612 as soon as the giallorossi expressed a strong desire for me i didnt have any hesitation
9046613 we have all the qualities to be able to get right to the end
9046614 all the teams in the champions league are strong and we can get right to the end only with a lot of work and dedication

9046645 even when you look at the brochures of travel companies abroad you will see that it is clearly mentioned that holidays are planned to avoid rainy weather and then of course we have all these cases of landslides in the mountains during the monsoon and people drowning on the beachside therefore promoting monsoon tourism should be done carefully
9046646 we are more comfortable with the rains than people in europe or the us therefore promoting monsoon tourism among the domestic travellers would be better before venturing out of the country
9046647 honeymooners make for a big market and if they can be convinced to honeymoon during the rains nothing like it other niche products like ayurveda which kerala promotes can be used to promote the season since the body responds to the treatment better during the monsoon
9046648 during monsoon roads here simply break down proper connectivity is very important in order to promote monsoon tourism also safety should be the topmost concern

9046705 everything came out the word would be awesome from our standpoint
9046706 everything was clean there were a number of tests and josh came thought with flying colors obviously we hoped for that we needed to get some closure
9046707 the idea was to raise awareness among families especially because this is the first layer of barrier and to help people to realize they are not alone and be able to face the problem
9046708 the cast i worked with had no cinematic training which i thought would be useful to access things that a professional actor wouldnt be capable
9046709 usually an actor is trained to show things i thought it was important to show what a person was hiding
9046710 right up to the day of shooting i hadnt found a suitable character to play that role and i even thought about cutting her out
9046711 as it is a very masculine and male oriented society the thought of really coming out and revealing that fact they wanted to come out and revealing they are not a real male has real problems all of the women i met who wanted to be male didnt want this to be known for them it was a real problem coming out
9046712 the tone of the meeting was positive and constructive and i remain willing to facilitate further progress towards a solution

9046723 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9046724 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9046725 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9046726 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9046727 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments

9046733 i have always been driven to the desert i think the landscape itself influences people in a certain way

9046735 this is the exploration of the mystery of a woman called sylvia who has an emotional journey that takes her to the extremes it explores what makes her so damaged
9046736 you should ask people that question why are people so flawed because thats who we are
9046737 why is it when you watch a film and something happens that moves you it either moves you to tears or gives a chill down your spine its because we can see ourselves in that moment

9046771 it really improves citizen access to these records and makes government more open to kansas citizens
9046772 they were all in this together and it is a tragic situation

9046775 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove earwax called cerumen which serves an important protective function for the ear
9046776 cotton swabs and some other home remedies can push cerumen further into the canal potentially foiling the natural removal process and instead cause build up known as impaction
9046777 when cerumen builds to the point of causing symptoms such as pain ringing itching or hearing problems its a sign you should see a physician
9046778 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and include infections and hearing loss
9046779 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes

9046786 the most extreme case of overlooked diversity is the morphospecies apanteles leucostigmus
9046787 each attacking one or a very few closely related species of caterpillars
9046788 one of the messages of this paper is that you really need all of these different kinds of data in order to tell the species apart that just using the morphology alone or the genetic data or the ecological information alone isnt enough
9046789 however once the species are distinguished anyone can use the dna barcode to rapidly and accurately identify one of them
9046790 this represents microgastrine wasps reared from approximately 3 500 caterpillar species in acg
9046791 since there are an estimated 10 000 species of caterpillars there including many unsampled ones that mine inside leaves or live in fungi this is just the tip of the microgastrine iceberg
9046792 the family braconidae to which the microgastrines belong has about 15 000 described species in the world and its been estimated to have 50 to 60 000 species about the same as all vertebrates all fish mammals amphibians reptiles birds which is a lot
9046793 and what were saying is that if anything were underestimating how many more there are

9046810 the mehdi army suspension will be valid indefinitely and anyone who does not follow this order will not be considered a member of this group

9046812 there are a lot of different scenarios involved not just the 53 man roster that also invludes the practice squad and various injured lists at this time of year there is a lot of conversation between all teams in the league about the personnel movement so theres a lot of moving parts were just trying to sort all that out look at the different scenarios and manage it the best we can for this team
9046813 we talked about that and i think there are some advantages to deferring but weve played in an awful lot of games where when you win the toss you take the ball and weve done well in a lot of those games too

9046816 we had not thought to recruit in the us but it is a logical market for us as your countrys workers are well trained and skilled
9046817 we need workers for our service activities at a number of mine sites and for our state of the art workshops

9046829 our programming department will be hard at work on version 3 0 as soon as the launch of 2 0 is complete we rely heavily on member feedback and we are constantly adding new features to the project list

9046831 a revolt is brewing among anti abortion activists in his conservative base that could include a walkout at the republican national convention next week and a huge battle on the floor
9046832 if you are using a web search engine like google or yahoo or msn you have one interface into a variety of different types of documents
9046833 but with enterprise search you can tailor it to your business needs
9046834 when we make these technologies like a fully searchable product catalog in a new language sales trend up dramatically in those regions

9046836 google has created a lot of visibility around search on the consumer side
9046837 companies are very excited about that and see that search can be a mission critical application for the enterprise
9046838 in the basic information retrieval area google is being very disruptive
9046839 it has come in at a very compelling price point but they are not a product leader and are not differentiating themselves in terms of features and functionality

9046848 ive had secret lovers i can keep some things quiet
9046849 i dont want anybody thats been in my life before in my life anymore
9046850 i dont even want them to have any way of contacting me

9046852 i dont know jackson it can get pretty rough in a rancid pit
9046853 the average person spends 2 weeks of its life waiting for a traffic light to change
9046854 i think we not only jumped the shark long ago i think were inventing new sharks
9046855 were taking it to a whole new level fasten your seatbelts
9046856 i t keeps it interesting first and foremost most other tv shows are in the habit of figuring out their winning formula and then beating it into the ground whereas we take what we already know works and toss it out the window at the start of every season which i think is very bold and ambitious and it certainly provides a new playground for the actors
9046857 that said ive been more comfortable with some seasons than others my favorites so far has been one and three because i actually think that my character works best behind bars with very real physical deadly obstacles to surmount whereas second season was a total change of pace and a real downshift for me and was one of my least favorite seasons because it felt as though my character was literally and figuratively riding shotgun much more reactive than active that can be frustrating but like i said its most important for a show thats running 67 episodes at this point to keep it as fresh and as exciting for the actors as possible
9046858 i think that michael is still a good man but at this point i think it would take something quite extreme for him to really even the score because in order for his brother to go free so many people have died in the process and i think that weighs terribly on michaels conscience
9046859 once this experience is over once say they successfully destroy the conspiracy there is no returning to his white collar existence as a structural engineer i mean i think the only thing that michael is kind of fit for at this point is as a hired gun which actually dovetails quite nicely with the directions he takes
9046860 well its not csi its not law amp order it cant run forever
9046861 i do feel as though we may be on one of our final laps around the track it is something that weighs on my mind from time to time telling a story correctly necessitates knowing when to end it at this point in the series michael and lincoln between them have intentionally or unintentionally killed so many people and yet theyre still running around with t bag its really a testament to robert knepper that his character has survived through four whole seasons but the man is a maniac a psychopath and a child killer and a rapist and yet he and the boys are still digging ditches together eventually you have to wonder when is enough enough because it really makes my character look bad these are the questions that i think eventually we have to answer or else suffer a fall off in terms of believability and quality
9046862 i think that we address it as plausibly as possible it helps that the show is kind of fantastic and i feel like weve gotten away with worse but at the same time we do provide an explanation and we dont tease the audience its not a flash of saras ponytail disappearing down an ally for the first episodes everyone wondering when shell actually make a face to face with michael shes back first episode michael and sara reunited and then the gang hits the ground running because theres work to do
9046863 the tattoo is addressed pretty definitively in the very first episode its funny it was a fan favorite the first season but then michael escaped mission accomplished suddenly it was just something that kind of had to be born rather than be something that could be used as a plot device that resulted in me in dallas in 120 degree heat wearing long sleeve shirts because were still pretending that i actually have the damn thing on i appreciated the tattoo and i think its addressed in the first episode of season four as something thats kind of emblematic of michaels experience that this is an experience that has left its mark its not something that can be easily washed off and it speaks to the fact that michael is now a changed man inside and out
9046864 i think id bring back paul adelstein i thought he was a fantastic agent kellerman and i thought was symbolic of the kind of character that the show does best which is someone living within the shades of gray not entirely black not entirely white not entirely good not entirely evil but someone who is complicated as we all are in real live i think paul really did a beautiful job of defining a character who could be vicious one minute and entirely sympathetic the next hes very much missed
9046865 i think that theyre mentioning this to show respect for katrina but have no intention of actually doing it
9046866 it would be an extraordinary thing to delay the convention
9046867 these are very very highly detailed orchestrated events and once they come apart they would be very difficult to put back together
9046868 there is some immediate political advantage to saying that a crisis is upon us and as the presumptive republican nominee i want to demonstrate a laserlike focus on that crisis
9046869 christian terrorists were said to be laying siege to a high school this story is worth noting
9046870 their agenda is to wipe out christians and christianity from india starting from orissa
9046871 theyre flying me out six days after the pulver fight to mexico city to do a press conference and to make a huge announcement
9046872 as i understand it both urijah and i are going i think both of us just need to hold up our ends of the bargain on sept 10 so yeah you essentially hit the nail on the head
9046873 at this point were not sure whether a crime even occurred

9046884 we try not to pull the trigger too early on evacuation because you dont want to have false alarms
9046885 what do you think are the best ways to present buddhism to the western students
9046886 i think buddhism should open the door of psychology and healing to penetrate more easily into the western world as far as religion is concerned the west already has plenty of belief in a supernatural being its not by the law of faith that you should enter the spiritual territory of the west because the west has plenty of this
9046887 personally learning about science has helped me to understand buddhism more deeply i agree with einstein that if there is a religion that can go along with science it is buddhism that is because buddhism has the spirit of nonattachment to rules you may have a view that you consider to be the truth but if you cling to it then that is the end of your free inquiring you have to be aware that with the practice of looking deeply you may see things more clearly that is why you should not be so dogmatic about what you have found you have to be ready to release your view in order to get a higher insight that is very exciting

9047218 above all the speech reflects on the role of the presidency and the qualities that are demanded by the job and makes the case that john mccain is the best qualified to be our next leader and commander in chief

9047220 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments over the past seven and a half years american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9047221 the major issues facing the country from terrorism and war to the economy and the direction of our culture

9047301 since track forecasts are always subject to large errors at three to five days it is simply impossible at this time to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
9047302 hej det er jomfru maria i dag drak jeg mig fuld
9047303 gov palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
9047304 sarah palin is an exciting choice by sen mccain she completes a strong ticket that will bring a real record of change and reform to washington
9047305 she is a strong defender of traditional family values with an unquestioned commitment to protect life gov palin knows we must aggressively pursue american energy sources like offshore drilling to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
9047306 in choosing gov palin mccain has put washington on notice he is serious about shaking up the status quo and leading a movement for reform on behalf of families and small businesses
9047307 a working mother with a track record of getting things done
9047308 another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9047309 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9047310 the choice of sarah palin is surely a hail mary pass
9047311 it is a real roll of the dice and shows what a strong position the obama biden team and democrats in general are in in this election
9047312 while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9047313 given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic
9047314 whats going to happen here is that desire to change that hillary clinton has helped bring about will ultimately lead to an obama biden win in november i dont think it changes the dynamics
9047315 i think as they come to know gov sarah palin they are going to see her not simply as an embodiment of those strong conservative values that thrill my heart but they are going to see her as an embodiment of an accomplished american women
9047316 and i believe that will resonate with millions of american women
9047317 i believe that people will look back and assess how hillary was treated by the media during the campaign primaries and it remains to be seen whether or not the ugly head of sexism in the media will raise its head again
9047318 i have always said that i wish i would have never been the only woman until now
9047319 over the years the health insurance companies have certainly interfered with the patient physician relationship
9047320 they have become the unseen but ever present censor of what the doctor orders
9047321 when i started filing managed care claims in the early 1990s i had to add two full time employees just to handle the added paperwork
9047322 the patients doctors and patient care seem to take second fiddle to insurers profits insurance codes preapprovals business plans and the like all controlled by business types in suits who have never directly helped a sick person in their life
9047323 the first questions patients are asked when they see a doctor is what kind of insurance do you have
9047324 he feels physicians are forced to ask that up front
9047325 the insurance system that pays physicians is a volume driven system that doesnt allow for the extra time you need to spend with some patients
9047326 had to see a lot more patients every month just to cover the additional staffs salaries and benefits
9047327 im just like an old country doctor hang out a shingle take care of patients and charge a fair price
9047328 medicine is supposed to be about love and nurturing and about having fun with our patients maybe even a hug once in while
9047329 it is not supposed to be about how to operate a faster conveyor belt
9047330 he re aggravated the injury in the tournament semi final versus the u s on august 22
9047331 an mri scan earlier this week confirmed he had re aggravated the injury and that there was no additional damage to the ankle or ligament
9047332 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
9047333 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9047334 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
9047335 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9047336 fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
9047337 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
9047338 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
9047339 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9047340 it was 2 in the morning or so and it seemed like johns father had been sleeping before it happened
9047341 he got to the point pretty quickly after we got moving
9047342 captain mccain was upset but he didnt go on talking about it very long
9047343 he wanted to get home he just said no more of that the important thing was that we not jeopardize anything for ourselves
9047344 fetal exposure to magnesium sulfate before anticipated early preterm delivery did not reduce the combined risk of moderate or severe cerebral palsy or death although the rate of cerebral palsy was reduced among survivors
9047345 a randomized controlled trial of magnesium sulfate for the prevention of cerebral palsy
9047346 the rigorous trial design and the fact that all three primary endpoints were met with statistical significance reinforce the quality of the data supporting the potential for azilect to have an effect on disease progression
9047347 the successful outcome of the study provides further rationale for the early use of azilect among parkinsons disease patients
9047348 delaying disease progression is the most important unmet need in the management of parkinsons disease
9047349 the adagio study the first of its kind was prospectively designed to demonstrate if azilect can slow down the progression of parkinsons disease results of the study show that early treatment with once daily rasagiline 1mg tablets provided significant clinical benefits that were not obtained by those patients where initiation of azilect therapy was delayed by nine months
9047350 the problem is that if you happen to be an individual who has the wrong genetic code in tlr3 you might inadvertently trigger a detrimental effect in your retina
9047351 you might cure the individual of one thing and increase their risk in something else
9047352 this discovery has significant implications for diagnosing the dry form of amd which is the most prevalent form affecting more than 8 million americans
9047353 it also allows us to develop new drugs to treat the dry form of amd for which there currently is no treatment
9047354 what tlr3 does in the case of infection is sacrifice an infected cell to protect the neighborhood
9047355 you and me we have a good 20 to 30 percent chance of getting macular degeneration
9047356 so when the time comes for us to start thinking about intervention we might want to get genotyped first and then decide what kind of therapeutic paradigm might be most appropriate for us
9047357 if we can figure out which viruses might be acting as triggers we might be able to find a way to combat them this would be a far more effective therapy in my view than trying to design a gene therapy approach
9047358 clearly the statement that were not all the same is not exactly novel and yet im still struck by how homogenized people become when it comes to clinical trials
9047359 hes always been likeminded on national security which is where im coming from
9047360 he votes democratic sounds republican and puts a plague on both political houses
9047361 he became one of those symbols that people read into it whatever they like a bit like obama this year
9047362 but they in a sense looked past whatever information there was about him being more conservative than the rest of the community
9047363 one of things we really try and do at conventions is find jews that have not been affiliated before to let them know that not only can we get a minyan now but theres a lot of us out there and that theyre not in hostile territory being republican jews
9047364 in texas its not a famous yiddish saying they teach you to dance with the one that brung you
9047365 i had made a decision that john mccain was the one i was going to back and until john mccain dropped out of the race i would continue to back him

9047370 heidi is steeped in the financial details of our global enterprise and she played an integral role in developing our accounting policies financial controls and external reporting practices
9047371 heidi is well positioned to lead the finance team through this transition

9047374 the biggest fe mod you can make is to adjust the nut behind the wheel
9047375 the biggest fe mod you can make is to adjust the nut behind the wheel
9047376 we are balancing the need to provide for public safety against allowing for as much public access to the national forest as is reasonable at this time
9047377 my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9047378 i am very happy my son will follow in my footsteps ewing said in a statement hopefully he will have a long and productive career in new york i am proud of him and wish him nothing but success
9047379 we saw the plane coming from the west making a slow descent flying really low
9047380 it got down to about two or three foot off the water for a good ways before it finally clipped the water and slowed right down to nothing the nose barely went down in the water and it just sunk like it was still sitting on the tarmac
9047381 when i got to him and we were paddling back the pilot said i slowed it down as slow as i could
9047382 ill bet the wheels arent even broken off it was so slow
9047383 for it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before god but the doers of the law will be justified
9047384 for we charge that all both jews and greeks are under sin as it is written there is none righteous no not one
9047385 but now the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ is revealed for all who believe
9047386 i dont want her holding the reins when he shuffles off this mortal coil
9047387 jon cohn has continued to follow the saga of john goodman the mccain health care policy advisor who has said that the ability to go to an emergency room is as good as having health insurance
9047388 i am concentrating on my own game and physically i am fine
9047389 it was a difficult match so i am happy to be through
9047390 players like that have nothing to lose so they start going for their shots

9047432 studypoint is a great tutoring agency that provides a tremendous amount of support both in coaching and tools to help me make the most out of the tutoring sessions with my students
9047433 working for studypoint is such a positive experience because of its overall commitment to serving the students and tutors needs its dependable support and thoughtful preparation allow both students and tutors to attain their goals in the most encouraging and effective way
9047434 the idea was to raise awareness among families especially because this is the first layer of barrier and to help people to realize they are not alone and be able to face the problem
9047435 the cast i worked with had no cinematic training which i thought would be useful to access things that a professional actor wouldnt be capable
9047436 usually an actor is trained to show things i thought it was important to show what a person was hiding
9047437 right up to the day of shooting i hadnt found a suitable character to play that role and i even thought about cutting her out
9047438 as it is a very masculine and male oriented society the thought of really coming out and revealing that fact they wanted to come out and revealing they are not a real male has real problems all of the women i met who wanted to be male didnt want this to be known for them it was a real problem coming out
9047439 i have always been driven to the desert i think the landscape itself influences people in a certain way
9047440 we experienced the desert and the sun and the extreme cold in the desert to the nonstop rain in oregon i think the weather and the landscape also influences the character
9047441 this is the exploration of the mystery of a woman called sylvia who has an emotional journey that takes her to the extremes it explores what makes her so damaged
9047442 you should ask people that question why are people so flawed because thats who we are
9047443 why is it when you watch a film and something happens that moves you it either moves you to tears or gives a chill down your spine its because we can see ourselves in that moment
9047444 there is something about kim theres a strength with her leftover vulnerability from her 20s thats just unbelievably beautiful to watch there are moments on the screen when shes shaking her entire body is shaking for real you couldnt act that

9047560 detroit is a race we really think we are going to perform well and well know where we are after detroit we can only go step by step and do the best we can i really feel we are going to be contenders this weekend and after that we will see where we are
9047561 im pretty sure if i stay at kv racing technology over the winter and we do some work on the car for the ovals we should be contenders for the championship if we finish top five and everything goes well to be going for next years championship i dont see any reason why not
9047562 we actually had to repair the car in the middle of the morning session and had to end early because we had to fix it
9047563 i think the car can be a little bit quicker and using the baseline setup from this morning it should have been quicker helio is quite fast but i dont know if the track changed because of the weather a lot of people seemed to have a lot of understeer during the session

9047571 silent spring became a runaway bestseller with international reverberations it is well crafted fearless and succinct even if she had not inspired a generation of activists carson would prevail as one of the greatest nature writers in american letters
9047572 somebody asked me what my name was and i told them the devil i cant make this up theres no benefit in me telling the world that basically i was demon possessed
9047573 as they began to pray i remember actually slithering off the couch and you know stuff that you would pretty much see in movies it was almost like a modern day exorcist without without the green face and its stuff most people cant handle you know even most christians cant handle it

9047575 the big colorful pictures and the fun images word plays and rhymes make this an amusing exposition of the ecology crisis
9047576 since the elections in may 2007 there have been major changes in the way the council goes about its business in particular it has marked the start of a new style of leadership within the council
9047577 since the formation of the new council we have re examined the councils foundations and where necessary rebuilt them
9047578 the leadership panel is tackling things head on members make decisions and act on them
9047579 there have also been significant changes in the councils chief officers there is a new chief executive and a new director of social work housing and health who together with other chief officers make up the corporate management team
9047580 as a council we now aspire to be the most dynamic inclusive and sustainable community in scotland this is an ambitious goal but based on the current rate of improvement it is by no means an unrealistic one
9047581 i would encourage everyone to read the annual report it gives an illuminating insight into how the council operates and the successes achieved over the past year
9047582 i would like to thank the elected members of all political parties and the dedicated employees of the council for the way in which through hard work and co operation they are making real changes within the council that will bring many benefits to the people of south ayrshire
9047583 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9047584 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9047585 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9047586 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9047587 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9047588 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9047589 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9047590 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9047591 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari

9047593 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9047594 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9047595 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9047596 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9047597 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9047598 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9047599 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9047600 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti

9047602 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9047603 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9047604 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9047605 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9047606 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9047607 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9047608 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese

9047614 in quando commander in chief non esiter mai a difendere questa nazione ma invier le truppe solo con una missione chiara e il sacro impegno a fornir loro quanto necessario durante la battaglia e le cure e i benefici che meritano una volta tornati a casa

9047619 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali

9047628 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9047629 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9047630 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9047634 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9047635 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9047636 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9047637 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9047638 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9047639 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9047640 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9047641 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9047642 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9047643 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema

9047684 als je een vrouw treft die helemaal voor de volle 100 procent achter je werk staat dan betekent dat een geweldige steun maar je moet ook openstaan voor de vraag wat doe ik de ander ermee aan want linksom of rechtsom je bent als predikant een vreemdeling in de samenleving en niet zelden ook een eenzame
9047685 en wat het gezin betreft er zijn te veel kinderen van predikanten die bij het geloof zijn weggegaan dan dat we daar achteloos aan voorbij kunnen lopen

9047696 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9047697 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9047698 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9047699 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9047700 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9047701 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9047702 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9047703 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9047704 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9047705 ze is absoluut tegenstander van abortus en gruwt van het homohuwelijk
9047706 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9047707 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9047708 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9047709 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9047710 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9047711 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9047712 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9047713 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9047714 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9047715 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9047716 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9047717 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9047718 recently while wrestling in my mind with a problem i thought to be of serious consequence i went to my knees in prayer
9047719 god is weaving his tapestry according to his own grand design
9047720 1 cor 15 22 that he lives our resurrected lord and master
9047721 then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying
9047722 jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind
9047723 and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
9047724 on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
9047725 this must be the foundation of our instruction love of god and love for and service to others neighbors family and all with whom we have association you and i may fail as individuals and miss the blessing
9047726 i bear witness to you this morning that he watching over israel slumbers not nor sleeps god help us to be faithful to the great trust he has placed in us i humbly pray as i invoke the blessings of the lord upon you in the name of jesus christ amen
9047727 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9047728 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9047729 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9047730 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9047731 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9047732 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9047733 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9047734 mccain no puede darnos el cambio que merece ee uu
9047735 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9047736 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9047737 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9047738 four bodies were found at the scene of the clash at barakhama but the identity of the deceased is yet to be established
9047739 we have verified the antecedents of the woman and found that she was a hindu
9047740 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9047741 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9047742 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9047743 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9047744 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9047745 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9047746 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9047747 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9047748 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9047749 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9047750 who are open to doing something on the production side
9047751 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9047752 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9047753 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9047754 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9047755 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9047756 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9047757 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9047758 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9047759 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9047760 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9047761 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9047762 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9047763 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9047764 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9047765 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9047766 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9047767 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9047768 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9047769 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9047770 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9047771 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9047772 im sure if janet lived up on the west hills she wouldnt be on this list
9047773 theyre going after the people who historically have lived there old town
9047774 particularly uncomfortable about the role of leonards secret list in supporting pba sponsored gentrification in the district
9047775 250 gb month is an extremely large amount of data much more than a typical residential customer uses on a monthly basis currently the median monthly data usage by our residential customers is approximately 2 3 gb to put 250 gb of monthly usage in perspective a customer would have to do any one of the following send 50 million e mails at 0 05 kb e mail download 62 500 songs at 4 mb song download 125 standard definition movies at 2 gb movie upload 25 000 hi resolution digital photos at 10 mb photo
9047776 i believe everything happens for a purpose in my own personal life if i dedicated back to my creator what im trying to create for the good everything will turn out fine
9047777 yes i inhaled when it was legal but im against the legalization of pot now
9047778 stay off our lawn you radical environmentalists who dont even live in this state
9047779 all we care about in this campaign are the voters in our 18 battleground states
9047780 in a state where we already have a demographic advantage where our base vote is higher than mccains hes going to have to win a massive amount of the swing vote to have a chance
9047781 obama is less formed in michigan as a campaign and as individual
9047782 presumably the reason to pick romney would be to help on the economy
9047783 but boy that would be the greatest job killing machine in the history of american politics mitt romney is an expert on cayman island tax shelters you couldnt have a more out of touch ticket
9047784 there are a lot of scenarios where we dont need
9047785 if we win ohio or florida i dont think john mccain has any chance to win the presidency
9047786 its close now itll be close in september and itll be close in october
9047787 the places where you have the highest number of base voters are the places you have the best chance of winning
9047788 we think theres going to be slightly more than 10 million people voting in florida our base we think is more than 5 million you gotta like that now im not saying were going to turn everyone out but it lessens the amount of the swing vote you have to get
9047789 would obama help unify our country on this and other issues if he was elected he has such exception personal and political qualities it almost seems possible even a kingdom foreigner like myself is tempted to hope but its precisely at this point that i have to remind myself that i am a citizen of a different empire and am not to get overly invested in civilian affairs i have to therefore regard obamas call to embrace the audacity of this political hope as a temptation whatever good obama mccain or any other politician may or may not be able to accomplish the ultimate hope and allegiance of all kingdom citizens must remain in jesus christ and in the mustard seed kingdom he established our call as ambassadors of christ is to individually and corporately look like jesus in how we love and serve people including the poor the marginalized the judged and women with unwanted pregnancies and our call is to trust that god will use the foolishness of this humble servant activity to advance his kingdom and ultimately transform the world this is the audacious hope we foreigners are to embrace and passionately work for i just wish i could articulate it as eloquently and as powerfully as obama
9047790 even if it cant be seen your indifference is always felt
9047791 our goal is to demonstrate how the american suburb has catalyzed the creation of new art and suggested new ways of thinking about suburbias physical form
9047792 the fact that an architect or artist is paying attention to suburbia might cause a visitor to stop and think maybe i need to consider my own situation my own neighborhood my own environment
9047793 this exhibition is not intended as a primer on the latest statistics about suburbia or a history of it
9047794 rather it features the work of artists and architects who without that burden have imaginatively considered the subject drawing inspiration from provoking discussion about and casting either an appreciative or critical eye on an environment that for better or worse constitutes an ever larger portion of our world
9047795 the bush administration has not proven that it will effectively enforce labor and environmental provisions however good they may be
9047796 what you would see in an obama administration would not be an abandonment of trade expansion but rather an expansion of issues
9047797 dont tell me in mexico you expect to get the same kind of treatment that we give other democracies and then you dont act in a democratic way not on my watch
9047798 has fought to address the root cause of the dissatisfaction and subsequent instability that has plagued the region particularly in recent years tremendous social inequality
9047799 data from an air force reconnaissance aircraft indicate that gustav has again become a hurricane with maximum winds near 75 miles 120 kilometers per hour
9047800 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion
9047801 on this track the center of gustav will pass near or over the cayman islands later friday over the western portions of cuba on saturday and into the southern gulf of mexico on sunday
9047802 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september
9047803 apple quickly released updates to fix 3g connectivity issues this year but consistently takes many months to release security updates
9047804 even when a user chooses to physically secure the device with a four digit passcode apple has chosen to still permit the user to use some functionality
9047805 by selecting to perform an emergency call the user can then gain access to other options which eventually leads them to near full access on the phone never having had to enter that passcode
9047806 this is an exceptionable security flaw that is not an acceptable risk for many enterprises and consumers alike
9047807 until apple begins to publicly address these fundamental design development and process issues enterprises will remain skeptical of the
9047808 that sent from my iphone kicker either makes this e mail completely legitimate or illegitimate
9047809 we are working on some bugs which affect around two percent of the iphones shipped and hope to have a software update soon
9047810 i dont mean to draw a conclusion based on this nitpicky observation but i just thought itd be interesting to point out
9047811 furthermore plans unless specifically designated for tethering usage cannot be used for any applications that tether the device through use of connection kits other phone pda to computer accessories including without limitation laptops or other equipment for any purpose
9047812 if america had had 43 black presidents then we would be describing barack obama as potentially the countrys first white president
9047813 we have a small platform where our production is connected through a pipeline to another operators platform that operator is responsible for reporting those volumes
9047814 because that operator shut in we have a minor shut in
9047815 all we have seen so far are stories originating in russia this is supposed to work between the governments as far as we know the russian federation hasnt informed the usda of anything
9047816 a fraction of the plants authorized to ship were waiting on some details but in the meantime companies just make adjustments and move on
9047817 while we have not received confirmation from the u s government there are reports three of our u s poultry plants have been delisted by russia we do not believe this will have any significant impact on our export sales since two of the affected plants have not recently been shipping anything to russia and because we have 16 other approved u s plants available to continue meeting the needs of our russian customers
9047818 we have been waiting for the russian veterinary and phytosanitary service to inform our government of the results of the recent series of audits of u s poultry plants and cold storage facilities that were conducted by vpss in july and august
9047819 unfortunately we learned today that vpss has removed 19 of these establishments from the list of facilities approved for export to russia for various deficiencies cited by the vpss auditors
9047820 russia also issued a cautionary statement on 29 other u s plants saying that product originating in those plants was tested and showed levels of certain substances that were higher than russia allows
9047821 incomum ver pessoas vestidas assim nas ruas ent o naturalmente algumas pessoas ficaram olhando para eles
9047822 after we went down 2 0 we changed to a 3 4 3 and we were really pushing
9047823 we had a lot of new starters out there but once we get scott and sam back i think we can put it together
9047824 we started off a little sluggish but we eventually really got our bats going
9047825 we were up 16 9 going into the seventh so we just need to learn to shut the door a little more
9047826 and with a freshman like travis i think were going to have a way stronger team than we have the last couple of years
9047827 na it lia eles est o satisfeitos mas aqui em bedum estamos ainda mais felizes porque a torre de pisa inclina menos que a nossa
9047828 whoah there is no way thats what the author intended even though thats the only valid way to read what the question says we should actually alter the question to what he really meant plane stationary and then ask
9047829 you are assuming that the speed of the plane is measured by the wheels and there is nothing that says that
9047830 can a plane that is moving forward at take off speed take off
9047831 can a conveyor belt keep a plane from achieving take off speed
9047832 water gushed in at midnight and it was raining we somehow fled to the road in the dark
9047833 the pm hovered above and declared this a national calamity but see on the ground is there any help
9047834 the ground situation is different from what the pm said before camera there is no government help
9047835 my brother in law has called many times from his lakshmipur village but the boats are not going to evacuate him
9047836 there have been only announcements so far this small army group is inadequate
9047837 my parents and the entire family are isolated without food for the last one week please put in a word with the army sir to bring them to safety
9047838 there is absolutely nothing i can do in terms of qualification
9047839 i cant qualify in the euro points list and i cant qualify in the world rankings list so as far as thats concerned i am as relaxed as they come
9047840 but i have been playing some very solid golf recently my focus is this week trying to give myself the opportunity to win the overall prize of 10 million and try and win a golf tournament
9047841 i want my second son to come to this world
9047842 had it not been the floods we would have waited for the right time to take her to the primary health centre phc
9047843 my co villager meena devi gave birth to a child right beside the road to this relief camp
9047844 women of our village are still trapped we are demanding that they be first shifted to safer places
9047845 quite a large number of women arriving from flooded areas are expectant mothers
9047846 we are trying to bring pregnant women to the road once that is achieved trained nurses can take care of them
9047847 the constitution of geac is not proper as it lacks independent experts thereby leading to lack of transparency
9047848 the malicious and distorted views on the regulatory process being reported in the newspapers periodically
9047849 never provided any constructive inputs for streamlining the regulatory mechanism
9047850 may i in all humility remind you that i am not a member of geac i am an invitee to geac not because geac chose to do so but only because of a supreme courts decision

9047852 because its received disproportionate media coverage the whole purpose of his judgment has been undermined completely
9047853 unfortunately perhaps the effectiveness of what he has tried to do has been eliminated
9047854 that is really up to you ive invited argument on this point
9047855 i would not want to worry about getting out on the street with kids and a stroller and trying to put the right amount of money in that would be just one more thing to worry about
9047856 we attribute the decline to the opening of the light rail fewer people driving in and parking on the street and a little bit to the economy now that weve gotten into the fourth quarter of 08
9047857 we understand that people may be driving less to the center city and we want to encourage them to come to the center city whether they decide to come be vehicle and park on street or ride on the train or bus
9047858 its a difficult time this will be a challenging campaign
9047859 what ill ask people to do is look beyond this controversy dont forget about it but look beyond it for this campaign because there are so many people in this community who dont have a paycheck at all and they need help from the united way agencies
9047860 what we try to do is get them on a level playing field make sure they have the supplies they need make sure they have medical and dental assistance since most are uninsured
9047861 we do have some tough economic times we see the number of children increase and we dont hope the donations decrease
9047862 this will be a process and it will be a long term process i believe this campaign can be the first step in that process
9047863 ik had nog nooit van hem gehoord en dat maakt het vaak gevaarlijk
9047864 hij heeft het goed gedaan hij maakte het mij knap lastig dat bewijst nog maar eens hoe rijk het mannentennis is

9047873 if i really like him or feel a kind of love or something
9047874 but it is the memorial site commemorating a particular historical moment and connecting it to the present that infiltrates our being and transcends history
9047875 the photos of julie dermansky record the remembrance of horrific events through a lens that makes them immediate and palpable
9047876 my friends and fellow americans i am very pleased and very privileged to introduce to you the next vice president of the united states gov sarah palin of the great state of alaska
9047877 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9047878 shes got the grit integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today
9047879 to have been chosen brings a great challenge i know that it will demand the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less
9047880 a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
9047881 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9047882 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9047883 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9047884 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9047885 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9047886 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9047887 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9047888 shes got the grit integrity common sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today
9047889 i had promised my husband a little present for our anniversary and i hope he can see i delivered
9047890 this is a moment when great causes can be won and great problems can be overcome
9047891 in a dangerous world it is john mccain who can lead americas friends and allies in preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
9047892 it turns out the women of america arent finished yet
9047893 we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9047894 they wanted to show that they are independent and that they are the agents of change and they have gone outside the washington area to do it
9047895 of course theres a risk and i think john mccain assessed that risk
9047896 her dedication to principle her courage both before and after her election as governor of alaska and her personal qualities make her a perfect choice for vice president
9047897 any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the mccain candidacy will work their hearts out between now and november for the mccain palin ticket
9047898 at a time when many republicans are still clinging to pork barrel politics governor palin has quickly become a leader on this issue
9047899 she is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the republican brand
9047900 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9047901 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same

9047922 and i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington i am here for the cops and firefighters the teachers and assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures

9047925 we have important work to do tonight i am here first to support barack obama and second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden
9047926 i am not grateful to speak in the wake of hillarys magnificent speech but ill do the best i can
9047927 hillary said she would do whatever she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
9047928 like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama
9047929 i have the advantage of speaking from a perspective no democratic american other than jimmy carter can the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore american leadership in the world my experience has shown me that barack obama is the man for this job
9047930 in his first presidential decision he hit it out of the park
9047931 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
9047932 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
9047933 people all over the world have always been more impressed by the power of our example rather than the example of our power
9047934 yes he can but first we have to elect him
9047935 the the she la 24 litmus now of strongly pro life
9047936 first thing in the morning he always told his mom he wanted to go over to uncle waynes house
9047937 im the uncle im not the parent but they dont even take that into consideration they know theyve seen us around here they see how close me and wyatt were they come over and they know that and they give me the respect like i was his parent
9047938 i just cannot imagine how they feel today with an accident like this theyre the ideal couple
9047939 we came from the same school of music so everythings easy we blend in together good onstage and we play together well
9047940 singing the misfits songs we do during the set is quite a work out
9047941 i can play bass and give 100 percent and sing and give 100 percent
9047942 ive played bass my entire life and they need a front man
9047943 i want to step up and do that for them
9047944 as laid back as it is in led zeppelin s version i always wanted to here that song done in a way that was just anthemic
9047945 we had a good season and pulled out some great victories
9047946 i think it is definitely going to give us motivation for this season as we realized last year winning the regular season is not enough to put you in the ncaa tournament and that is our ultimate goal
9047947 i dont feel a lot of pressure on my shoulders this year i just try and show the way for the younger girls and be a good example
9047948 i have been a part of a winning team since i got here and we want to win conference again and also win the mountain west conference tournament
9047949 we have a lot of new faces coming in and we have some quality players that are already here so we have the talent
9047950 its just the matter of coming together as a team
9047951 adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
9047952 i have not signed onto the amethyst initiative nor do i expect to support lowering the drinking age
9047953 i have read the supporting commentary and am not convinced by any of the information provided
9047954 when i was a student each state had its own drinking age and mine was 18
9047955 from this personal experience i doubt that lowering the drinking age would have the desired effect i agree with the concerns raised about potential increases in dui and dwi incidents
9047956 i think its ridiculous that we are the only country that has the legal drinking age at 21
9047957 if an 18 year old can go to war for their country they should be able to make the choice whether or not they can drink alcohol
9047958 vip did victim impact panels for the court system throughout the state of missouri
9047959 during that time we saw over 33 000 offenders who were convicted of impaired driving traffic offenses and minors in possession
9047960 young adults are not always thinking about the big picture as were many of the adults we dealt with
9047961 hurting or killing another person is such a real thing when driving in an impaired state once the person has been killed or injured im sorry doesnt cut it
9047962 that person can never be replaced or their injuries can never be reversed
9047963 i dont think the drinking age should be lowered because it wouldnt change anything
9047964 actually thered probably be even more teens that drink i think younger teens will abuse their right to drink
9047965 i know there is the argument that young people will drink anyway but at least with it being against the law there is some room for a second thought
9047966 i think the drinking age should not be lowered because there would be no way to regulate teens from drinking
9047967 even if there is underage drinking the law still has the right to arrest these kids and at least try to prevent it
9047968 if we lower the age i feel that we are just giving into the system of today
9047969 on the unlv campus there is a course hed 435 635 titled health aspects of dangerous drugs that emphasizes individual responsibility in making positive choices related to use of alcohol and various other categories of drugs
9047970 a vote for obama is a vote for dead children
9047971 every year this nation is responsible for thousands of dead
9047972 no sir this nation is responsible for thousands of dead babies
9047973 its great to see the administration coming asking for money before they just take it
9047974 execute everything together and set the tempo for the rest of the season
9047975 linebackers jason beauchamp and starr fuimaono have upped their game
9047976 all that is pointed towards us doing it on saturday night not just doing it in practice
9047977 in general its a home game and we need to set the tempo with this game
9047978 weve been making a big deal about it since last winter conditioning
9047979 the good news is hes not out for the season
9047980 hes going to be leading us even though he cant be out on the field playing
9047981 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die today
9047982 it is really hard to get a bounce rate under 20 anything over 35 is cause for concern 50 above is worrying

9047987 we dont require testing instead we allow market forces to dictate whether tests are done
9047988 sorry you cant do that it would make the other guys look bad
9047989 i dont get upset because i have answered this question many times theres no need to explain anymore
9047990 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
9047991 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelps arms are coming over at a faster pace
9047992 he phelps made the right decision and the other guy made the wrong decision
9047993 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equaling spitzs record
9047994 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
9047995 i guess what else is left to do for him except come down and win races he hasnt won before
9047996 when you are the greatest swimmer ever i guess you can afford to do that
9047997 hes accomplished so much already he wants to accomplish more

9048000 he phelps made the right decision and the other guy made the wrong decision

9048004 when you are the greatest swimmer ever i guess you can afford to do that
9048005 hes accomplished so much already he wants to accomplish more
9048006 he better bring his a game because us sprint boys are a different league and we are not going go easy on him

9048052 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9048053 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9048054 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9048055 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9048056 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9048057 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9048058 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9048059 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9048060 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9048061 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9048062 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9048063 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9048064 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9048065 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9048066 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9048067 there is some kind of engagement to have some understanding of where we are because its not clear whether the talks have collapsed or are still on
9048068 the mediator has to help us appreciate where we are in terms of locating a way forward
9048069 we are trying with mbeki to get zanu pf to be flexible because there has not been any indication of movement of flexibility on the part of zanu pf
9048070 just with the south african mediators there is no zanu pf
9048071 we hope the talks can lead to the finalisation of the political and outstanding matters so that we can start with a normalisation of the political economic and humanitarian situation in zimbabwe
9048072 unless there is a political solution we dont have the necessary framework to deal with the economic recovery package for zimbabwe and the humanitarian crisis
9048073 it will be determined by the progress made they will continue until all parties feel they have covered sufficient ground
9048074 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9048075 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9048076 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9048077 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9048078 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9048079 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9048080 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9048081 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9048082 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9048083 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9048084 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9048085 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9048086 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9048087 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9048088 i am very happy to be in cyprus i feel overwhelmed and overjoyed
9048089 i want an artificial leg so i can walk again like other kids
9048090 im extremely grateful to cyprus for receiving us and to those who helped my son get out
9048091 i havent seen my sister for 10 years i cant wait to hug her we are going to celebrate
9048092 its a spectacular achievement israel said they would throw us in jail or prevent us from going to gaza but they didnt they acted responsibly
9048093 this has opened the door to humanitarian assistance of this kind and everything that goes with it
9048094 ele parece obcecado por mim quer conversar comigo o tempo todo tudo q ele faz ele quer minha opini o fica me elogiando e etc qto mais o evito parece q pior fica ate minha m e percebeu e disse q essa obsess o dele s pode ser paix o

9048098 a strict curfew is in force please stay indoors and dont come out for congregational prayers
9048099 this pro active step is prudent due to the decline in value during 2008 and increased level of volatility of the companys investment in federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and federal national mortgage association fannie mae preferred stock
9048100 the bank continues to have a strong capital level that exceeds well capitalized requirements
9048101 weve raided 69 companies today we have seized equipment including flat screen tvs cd players set top boxes and mp3 players
9048102 we want to express our sincere gratitude to the staff of the montgomery county fire academy
9048103 by providing the facility for our disaster loan outreach center they have helped disaster victims in their community we deeply appreciate their generosity
9048104 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9048105 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9048106 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9048107 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9048108 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9048109 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling

9048121 i am a proponent of teaching both evolution and intelligent design
9048122 and you know i say this too as the daughter of a science teacher growing up with being so privileged and blessed to be given a lot of information on on both sides of the subject creationism and evolution
9048123 the root of 78 percent of identity theft cases come from people knowing your information which is a key thing

9048125 nevada as a battleground state is going to be an exciting place to be because we nevada citizens might very well determine who the next president of the united states is
9048126 when hillary pulled out of the race sen obama called me
9048127 we talked about issues that are important to the people that i represent i felt very comfortable hearing his positions on those issues coming from his lips and after that conversation i endorsed him
9048128 being a part of history this is a once in a lifetime opportunity
9048129 the fact that this is my first presidential election i couldnt have asked for anything more
9048130 i have great confidence in the people that i represent
9048131 we are going to do everything we can to make sure that my fellow citizens who happen to be between the ages of 18 and 24 get out and vote the future of this country and the future of their lives is depending on the outcome of this election
9048132 ive served with sen john mccain for 26 years do i have the ability to speak with experience about someone who has abused everyone hes dealt with someone who does not have the temperament to be president whos wrong on the war wrong on the economy wrong on nuclear waste what am i supposed to do walk around talking about what a great guy he is i dont believe that
9048133 i ended up staying for two semesters thats how much i enjoyed it
9048134 the idea was from when i studied abroad and i couldnt find any scholarships
9048135 the number one reason why college students dont study abroad is financial
9048136 students who graduate with international experiences have a unique skill set to bring to the job market
9048137 it also helps to validate how important an international perspective and language skills are to careers and futures of college students
9048138 the goal is for all students to take advantage of it
9048139 i think sen viesca has been an outspoken leader for his college
9048140 for people in noisy electrical environments or too far out from the vrad
9048141 for the 18 to 29 crowd the text message is their own language
9048142 no one created it for them it grew organically young people have an astronomical level of engagement so were turning texting into a political dialogue
9048143 well be bringing the rock the vote mobile to colleges music events fairs and festivals throughout the fall and then to the first presidential debate
9048144 we hear a lot from young voters who dont know who to believe
9048145 some politicians dont want to show their views they just want to get the vote

9048151 when they look at his record and economic status he is a regular guy
9048152 he knows how to change washington without being changed by washington
9048153 it removed some of obamas weaknesses lack of experience in defense and foreign affairs which are important
9048154 obamas whole campaign is about change and with biden who has been in congress for so many years will there be any change
9048155 he promised to appoint more conservative judges his first appointment is the vp nomination
9048156 if he wants to win the conservatives hell probably go with romney
9048157 nominating secretary of state condelezza rice would help him win
9048158 mccain needs someone credible on the economic issue which is number one amongst most people
9048159 we train to win and we also schedule to become more competitive
9048160 we tried to schedule as many top programs as we could to prepare ourselves to be a top 20 team
9048161 our pick is indicative of the respect of the other four programs that are returning a significant amount of starters and that played very well last year but we expect to compete and we expect to win
9048162 our conference is going to be very challenging but we have the talent to do that its just going to be a matter of experience it might take us a little time to come around but very solid were very solid
9048163 it helps tremendously because they did have the experience of being a championship team theyve been in the program for three years and they know the expectations and they know the system

9048165 because here you embrace a significant portion of the world
9048166 i thought one could make the difference by coming here
9048167 the opportunity to do the work i want to do is gigantic
9048168 so far we have celebrated literature for its beauty or its style or romanticism postcolonial theory and practice looks at literature from the bottom up
9048169 we will learn what image postcolonial people have of us how better to work with them and also think more deeply more sophisticatedly about new human relations
9048170 my favorite part of the place has to be the klingon ride

9048184 the original legal doctrine regarding employers liability in england and america was based on the principle of individual responsibility for acts of negligence it has been abundantly shown in the experience of the different countries that this simple principle so equitable in theory has failed in practice to meet the requirements of a developing system of industry
9048185 there is a certain inherent hazard in industry that men will be hurt by reason of their employment therein just as machinery may become broken in that same industry and that the cost of those injuries whether to the men or the machinery is justly chargeable to the industry therefore no question of fault is to be considered but for the man who is injured in the course of employment there shall be a definite sure and certain relief
9048186 the common law system governing the remedy of workmen against employers for injuries received in hazardous work is inconsistent with modern industrial conditions in practice it proves to be economically unwise and unfair its administration has produced the result that little of the cost to the employer has reached the workman and that little only at large expense to the public the remedy of the workman has been uncertain slow and inadequate injuries in such works formerly occasional have become frequent and inevitable the welfare of the state depends upon its industries and even more upon the welfare of its wage worker the state of washington therefore exercising herein its police and sovereign power declares that all phases of the premises are withdrawn from private controversy and sure and certain relief for workmen injured in extra hazardous work and their families and dependents is hereby provided regardless of questions of fauly and to the exclusion of every other remedy proceeding or compensation except as otherwise noted in this act and to that end all civil actions and civil causes of action for such personal injuries and all jurisdiction of the courts of the state over such causes are hereby abolished except as in this act provided

9048222 entre os signat rios do manifesto est o o ex ministro da justi a m rcio thomaz bastos e o presidente da oab cezar britto
9048223 entendo que os crimes cometidos por autoridades durante o regime militar foram crimes de lesa humanidade e por isso n o prescrevem nunca
9048224 um absurdo falar em anistia para os dois lados quando a lei foi aprovada em 1979 os militares falavam que a lei nem se aplicava a eles pois n o tinham cometido crimes tanto o governo reconhece que isso ocorreu que tem indenizado as v timas agora n o d para achar que pessoas foram mortas e torturadas e ningu m foi respons vel
9048225 crimes cometidos por agentes do estado durante o regime como homic dio estupro oculta o de cad ver e forma o de quadrilha n o prescrevem
9048226 falar em puni o dos torturadores nada tem a ver com revanchismo pretendemos que sejam processados segundo as regras constitucionais com plenitude do direito de defesa que sejam identificados e que reconhecida a culpa sejam condenados

9048231 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9048232 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9048233 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

9048243 no one works for someone we all just work together
9048244 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9048245 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9048246 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9048247 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9048248 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9048249 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways

9048260 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9048261 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment in her scant two years as governor she
9048262 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil

9048275 the poor guy who died wasnt involved in anything he was trying to help
9048276 because its received disproportionate media coverage the whole purpose of his judgment has been undermined completely
9048277 unfortunately perhaps the effectiveness of what he has tried to do has been eliminated
9048278 that is really up to you ive invited argument on this point
9048279 i would hope that any scrap metal merchant that they were taken to wouldnt accept them or would contact the police
9048280 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9048281 at the moment we wouldnt accept liability for the fire we dont believe it should be on charged to us and a legal argument would have to be sorted out in court
9048282 my understanding of it is its the total cost of the fire suppression effort including fire engines i imagine they were of a significant cost and were destroyed but i imagine they have insurance
9048283 its in a rural area and we are the rural fire authority

9048290 la gobernadora palin es una probada reformista una inteligente administradora de los d lares de los contribuyentes y una campeona de la responsabilidad en el gobierno
9048291 el xito de la gobernadora palin se debe a su dedicaci n a los principios y a su comprometido trabajo tico y sirve como un ejemplo maravilloso del esp ritu de estados unidos
9048292 do you want this to be a physical event with assets damaged and destroyed or do you just want those things inaccessible do you want death and injuries or just to test the ability to get work up and going someplace else
9048293 some business managers dont want to show that they may not know how to respond to a certain issue
9048294 youre always asked to make timely decisions based on incomplete and inaccurate information
9048295 lo que no es campa a para ellos simplemente no le tomar n en cuenta lo que s es campa a para ellos ser sumada al gasto total

9048298 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9048299 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9048300 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9048301 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9048302 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9048303 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9048304 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9048305 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9048306 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9048307 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9048308 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9048309 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9048310 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9048311 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9048312 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9048313 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9048314 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9048315 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9048316 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9048317 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9048318 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9048319 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9048320 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9048321 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9048322 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9048323 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9048324 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9048325 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9048326 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9048327 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9048328 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9048329 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9048330 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9048331 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9048332 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9048333 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9048334 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9048335 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9048336 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9048337 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9048338 theres also this issue that on april 18th she gave birth to a baby with downs syndrome children with downs syndrome require an awful lot of attention the role of vice president it seems to me would take up an awful lot of her time and it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child
9048339 thats a very good question and i guess my guess is that perhaps the line inside the mccain campaign would be if it were a man being picked who also had a baby but you know four months ago with downs syndrome would you ask the same question
9048340 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9048341 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9048342 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9048343 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9048344 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9048345 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9048346 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9048347 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9048348 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9048349 according to the church people i approached and underlined by the undertaker an atheist cannot be buried in donegal because the churches catholic church of ireland and presbyterian own the graveyards therefore unless one is willing to compromise ones beliefs by agreeing to a religious service it is impossible to be buried
9048350 such diversity is one of the glories of the catholic church
9048351 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9048352 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9048353 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

9048374 three years ago illinois answered the call for help following hurricane katrina sending more than 2 500 response personnel and critical equipment to help louisiana and mississippi respond to that massive disaster
9048375 while we hope and pray that this storm wont be as destructive as katrina the state stands ready to assist whenever and wherever we are needed
9048376 our large scale deployment of personnel and equipment following hurricane katrina demonstrated our capabilities to respond to a major disaster even one nearly 1 000 miles away
9048377 it also provided us with many lessons learned and a solid blueprint that we can use if our assistance is needed in response to hurricane gustav
9048378 i go out there to do my job and i dont expect to be awarded with anything so its a great honor to be given the two awards today
9048379 they couldnt make it in and i had our jet boat which doesnt have a prop so i could make it in there so i got on one of the coast guard members to come with me
9048380 with the seas it could have capsized the vessel if we hadnt responded they could have run aground again they could have water coming in the boat so the boat could have sunk
9048381 i think ethan put the safety of the family as a priority he did place himself in harms way by going to rescue them and i admire that courage i admire the loyalty to the job
9048382 hes a very dedicated young man and were very fortunate to have the caliber of people like ethan and his good friend cody wheat

9048398 what were asking to do is eliminate some of those ugly looking white plastic bags you see floating all over in the river and trees
9048399 it is a cost to the taxpayers to recycle them number one and number two they do pose an environmental hazard to our waterways our aquatic life for our birds
9048400 the plastic bags just dont have much of a purpose
9048401 there are economic realities that we need to take into consideration as to what the prices are whats its going to financially cost businesses to be in compliance
9048402 we have several hundred bags that are plastic were gonna be using them up and come january were gonna be using ecologically friendly bags

9048413 hitler the okw and the various high commands disagreed about what the main objectives should be in the preparation for barbarossa most of the okw argued for a straight thrust to moscow whereas hitler kept asserting his intention to seize the resource rich ukraine and baltics before concentrating on moscow an initial delay which postponed the start of barbarossa from mid may to the end of june 1941 may have been insignificant especially since the russian muddy season came late that year
9048414 it said shooting came from three ethnic georgian villages but georgia blamed the separatists for provoking the clashes
9048415 this is another attempt by the separatist side to involve georgia in a military conflict
9048416 separatists opened fire at the two georgian villages of prisi and tamarasheni
9048417 tbilisi earlier said the shelling of south ossetias capital tskhinvali and a neighboring village had been provoked by the rebel region south ossetias leader said monday at least 300 north ossetians had already arrived in the breakaway region with up to 2 000 expected
9048418 a georgian armoured personnel carrier was destroyed by south ossetian militants near the village of avnevi one hour ago and three georgian peacekeepers were wounded as a result
9048419 that scenario started unfolding in south ossetia in late july by august 6 and 7 heavily armed proxy troops opened fire on georgian villages while the secessionist authorities refused to talk with tbilisi the attacking forces began destroying the transmission antennae of georgian mobile telephone systems arms and paramilitary groups poured in from russia to south ossetia through the russian controlled roki tunnel russian officials in georgia claimed that the attacking forces were out of russias control officials in moscow meanwhile justified the attacks directly and indirectly by accusing georgia of aggression interfax itar tass russian television august 4 7
9048420 mikheil saakashvili started this war with his barrage attack and occupation of south ossetia russias war of retribution was far less violent or excessive than the u s bombing of serbia for 78 days over kosovo or our unprovoked war on saddam husseins iraq which has brought death to scores of thousands or israels 35 days of bombing of lebanon for a border skirmish with hezbollah
9048421 what the does this have to do with america why the is our government involving us in this conflict
9048422 what do we do if russia responds to our patriots in poland with the russian s 300 anti aircraft system in iran and syria
9048423 but mom bush invaded iraq so why cant i invade georgia come on mom it is just not fair
9048424 he is fully within his rights to tamp down hooliganism
9048425 the main reason the neocons are going after russia is because they are pissed that putin locked up their fellow zionists the oligarchs which had gained control of the russian oil through crooked deals under yeltsin are we going to let the neocons run this country into the ground
9048426 regional expert german native and former european commission official patrick worms was recently hired by the georgian government as a media advisor and he explained to me exactly what happened when i met him in downtown tbilisi
9048427 i would say that the comments are somewhere in the range of four out of five saying that shes overstepped her place within society
9048428 we want people to do what they can to get the book out of the libraries out of the schools
9048429 planned parenthood has the nations largest network of sexual health educators providing accurate age appropriate information to teens and adults in schools health centers and communities nationwide
9048430 planned parenthood sexual health educators find that the book is a valuable resource for age appropriate comprehensive sex education and recommends it widely to parents
9048431 the book has gone out 48 times in 13 years and one person has a problem with it
9048432 i would hope that any scrap metal merchant that they were taken to wouldnt accept them or would contact the police
9048433 i knew hed be good because you said he was but i didnt think hed be that good
9048434 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9048435 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9048436 i thank you sen mccain and mrs mccain for the confidence you have placed in me
9048437 senator i am honored to be chosen as your running mate
9048438 i was hoping for her but i was very surprised

9048440 i actually didnt know who she was but im very excited now

9048445 exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help us fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9048446 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
9048447 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9048448 here is a woman of accomplishment who brings a fresh face to traditional values and models the type of woman most girls want to become
9048449 i believe in the strength and the power of women and the potential of every human life
9048450 governor palins story is one that all americans will find inspiring
9048451 shes a washington outsider with a commitment to the conservative principles that will make our nation stronger
9048452 the international fashion scene is huge we love bringing in amazing and creative collections that are generally unknown to canadians
9048453 almost naked is perfect for finding one of a kind pieces that nobody else has
9048454 women have always loved to wear sexy underwear because it makes them feel good its finally become acceptable for straight men to wear hip and sexy boxers and briefs too when youre wearing a great pair of underwear you just feel good
9048455 our store is great for gift occasions too we encourage men to buy for women and vice versa
9048456 theres also this issue that on april 18th she gave birth to a baby with downs syndrome children with downs syndrome require an awful lot of attention the role of vice president it seems to me would take up an awful lot of her time and it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child
9048457 thats a very good question and i guess my guess is that perhaps the line inside the mccain campaign would be if it were a man being picked who also had a baby but you know four months ago with downs syndrome would you ask the same question
9048458 this shocking choice says more about mccains desparation than it does about palins qualifications
9048459 its cool i want them to ask me the questions i dont have anything to hide

9048466 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9048467 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre gonna be as impressed as i am
9048468 america is going to fall in love with her when they get to know her
9048469 governor sarah palin is an excellent choice for vice president and a selection the entire conservative base can rally behind and support wholeheartedly
9048470 from standing up for the right to life and second amendment rights to fighting wasteful government spending and championing energy exploration sarah palin certainly makes an outstanding addition to the ticket
9048471 i was a fence sitter but john mccain has knocked me over with this one his sign is going in my yard
9048472 i think it is a great choice she has an awful lot of credentials for being a reformer i only wish we could get her here to pennsylvania to run for governor but she has bigger fish to fry
9048473 he really surprised people with this one the old maverick has come out its a smart choice a maverick choice
9048474 mccain doesnt have a chance in pennsylvania unless something unforeseen happens
9048475 i dont see him winning particularly because joe biden is so popular in southeastern pennsylvania
9048476 obama is going to roll up such a margin in southeastern pennsylvania it will be almost impossible for mccain to overcome i dont see how they can neutralize that without ridge
9048477 the son of man came to give his life a ransom for many
9048478 was it necessary for the son of god to die on the cross and if it was necessary why
9048479 for it was fitting for him for whom are all things and through whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings
9048480 permit it at this time for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness
9048481 therefore he had to be made like his brethren in all things so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make propitiation for the sins of the people
9048482 we have a law and according to our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god
9048483 there is therefore now no more condemnation to those who are in christ jesus

9048496 e una scelta fortemente irresponsabile che mira unicamente allaffermazione sugli organi di stampa di un movimento politico che mira alla propria visibilit e non a un serio progetto condiviso da tutte le forze dellunione sia chiaro che i ds non hanno ancora adottato alcuna decisione in che modo presentarsi alle elezioni comunali di vallecrosia
9048497 op zich zijn de zaken momenteel goed geregeld dicht bij de bewoners een hoop diversiteit tussen de verschillende stadsdelen biedt de mogelijkheid om op verschillende beleidsterreinen maatwerk te leveren bestuurders kunnen goed bereikbaar zijn volksvertegenwoordigers zijn mensen die uit de buurt komen en de problematiek beleven op de schop ja want het kan altijd beter met name de enorme zooi bureaucratie hebben we nog niet opgelost na de indeling van de stadsdelen is bij de centrale stad toch nog een bulk geld en ambtenaren blijven zitten die kan beter in de deelraden worden ingezet 400 man om de amenhang tussen 40 diensten te bewaken we werken op sommige terreinen onhandig met elkaar nog veel onduidelijkheid en veel te veel overleggen dat kan wat mij betreft op de schop de centrale stad heeft momenteel 40 diensten die allemaal op hun eigen terrein invloed willen hebben vaak bemoeinis waar een stadsdeel alleen maar last van heeft neem bijvoorbeeld de decentralisatie van het jeugdbeleid de stadsdelen moeten zich ongans rapporteren aan de centrale dienst wat levert dat op diensten werken langs elkaar heen en zijn in een continue domeinstrijd verwikkeld er is bovendien een bestuursdienst in het leven geroepen om te bewaken dat er integraal gewerkt wordt het is illustratief dat alleen al op die dienst we 400 ambtenaren werken en die gaan ook nog eens over alle voorstellen heen het kost gemiddeld 4 jaar en veel energie om de boel dan weer te stroomlijnen en dat is zonde van de tijd en energie wat mij betreft geen fusies maar aan de slag om de bureaucratie op te lossen
9048498 toen ik kwam trof ik een chaos aan na de fusie van de twee stadsdelen waaruit zuideramstel is voortgekomen inmiddels staat het allemaal weer op de rails
9048499 henk goetz bestuurders kan fors minder schaalgrootte is prima bevoegdheden daarop laten aansluiten
9048500 beide heren hebben een blinde vlek voor de zaken die de stadsdelen hebben opgepakt breed gedragen door de burgers die er anders nooit zouden zijn gekomen als het aan de centrale stad had gelegen was nu het westerpark een groot asfalt parkeerterrein had het cultuurbeleid in oud west en de baarsjes geen kans gekregen en was de stedelijke vernieuwing in zuid oost niet van de grond gekomen minder bestuurders zoals henk bepleit is de dood in de pot het gaat erom dat de centrale diensten af moeten van die potjes die ze beheren dat moet naar het stadsdeelfonds die kunnen dan bepalen waar ze hun geld het beste op inzetten
9048501 mensen hebben behoefte aan goed en deskundig overleg met ambtenaren of de bestuurders wat wil henk nou eigenlijk de eigen kleine schaal behouden en uitbesteden wat jezelf niet kunt dan krijg je dubbele projectleiders nee de stadsdelen moeten zelf in staat zijn om belangrijke zaken te regelen en moeten daarvoor voldoende kwaliteiten hebben dat vereist een zekere schaalgrootte ik vind de stadsdelen een goede keus je hoort mij niet zeggen dat ze weg moeten dat we naar een rotterdams model moeten waarbij de stadsdelen bijna niks te zeggen hebben een farce de ambtelijke organisatie moet beter dat kan alleen efficient met grotere stadsdelen
9048502 dat als even de onderwijsamtenaar zwanger is dit terrein voor een half jaar stil zou komen te liggen is onzin het is een kwestie van prioriteiten stellen en zorgen voor vervanging of inhuren van iemand als dat nodig dat kost wel geld maar dat is het waard ook binnen de bestuursdient van de centrale stad tref ik regelmatig een post aan die even niet bezet is het komt in grote organisaties net zo hard voor
9048503 als je een belofte doet aan de kiezer om bepaalde zaken te regelen dan moet je dat gewoon organiseren en dan betaal je er maar voor
9048504 er zijn veel meer bevoegdheden gedecentraliseerd dit biedt de bewoners de mogelijkheid om voor hun belangen op te komen en keuzes kunnen beter gemaakt worden hoe meer bevoegdheden zijn gedecentraliseerd hoe meer politieke keuzes hoe meer controle daarop moet worden georganiseerd
9048505 ambtenaren zijn er niet voor het beleid te bepalen goed dat er een laag is ingebouwd om dat op stadsdeelnivo te kunnen doen
9048506 dat heeft niet zoveel met schaalgrootte te maken grotere deelraden grotere besluiten nog meer capabele mensen nodig als je kijkt naar de centrale stad de wethouders duiventil de raadsleden struikelen over hun declaraties wat is er makkelijker
9048507 voor de oorlog was alles beter kijk eens naar een wibaut

9048641 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9048642 former mayor of a town of 9 000 just a heartbeat away from the presidency
9048643 todays announcement was an act of political desperation by the mccain campaign but it does not alter the fact that the republican ticket promises ohioans more of the same
9048644 none of my pro hillary female friends are falling for this obvious gop pander
9048645 sarah palin has a great deal of surface appeal at first
9048646 the only thing he is going to let her do in the white house is teach him how to use the internet
9048647 palin makes mccain look ancient out of touch and totally yesterday
9048648 i know hillary clinton and sarah palin is no hillary clinton
9048649 it would be a clear sign from the mccain campaign that they were going to be making a very strong bid for the women whom they see up for grabs both the traditional swing independent suburbanites and then the hillary clinton supporters who remain disillusioned

9048656 exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help us fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second

9048659 everything came out the word would be awesome from our standpoint
9048660 everything was clean there were a number of tests and josh came thought with flying colors obviously we hoped for that we needed to get some closure
9048661 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9048662 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9048663 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9048664 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9048665 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9048666 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9048667 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9048668 he had his own schtick and it was very beautiful and it actually made the moment even that much better
9048669 it wasnt simply being on the bridge it really felt very emotional
9048670 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that

9048672 the idea was to raise awareness among families especially because this is the first layer of barrier and to help people to realize they are not alone and be able to face the problem
9048673 the cast i worked with had no cinematic training which i thought would be useful to access things that a professional actor wouldnt be capable
9048674 usually an actor is trained to show things i thought it was important to show what a person was hiding
9048675 right up to the day of shooting i hadnt found a suitable character to play that role and i even thought about cutting her out
9048676 as it is a very masculine and male oriented society the thought of really coming out and revealing that fact they wanted to come out and revealing they are not a real male has real problems all of the women i met who wanted to be male didnt want this to be known for them it was a real problem coming out

9048706 according to a white paper from cree a backlight solutions provider expected to provide its led technology to apple led based backlights also consume less power run cooler and last longer than ccfls
9048707 meanwhile backlight unit blu makers coretronic and kenmos are also sending samples to be incorporated in the panels with official shipments to also kick off around a similar period
9048708 according to digitimes component makers indicated apple plans to use the led v cut light guide panel technology from japans stanley electric which is a technology authorizer and major shareholder of taiwans kenmos

9048741 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9048742 sometimes i think she has desperate character written on her the clothes we wear send a message and i think thats the message i dont think thats her intention though
9048743 shes a gorgeous woman and she understands her fashion i cant help but think thats shes pretty high maintenance
9048744 i am writing all the time i love composing and the whole thing but i am also raising my children and enjoying it and teaching them to ride bicycles and how to read i love it
9048745 we go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i want them to get to do the kind of things i didnt get to do so i fill them with a lot of enjoyment that way a lot of amusement you know
9048746 i have always loved show business and have always enjoyed making people happy through that medium i love the celebration of music and dance and art i just love it
9048747 just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons

9048749 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it

9048753 i have a fairly specific idea of what the first 15 pages of the screenplay will be and no idea what will happen on pages 16 through 130 i have very strong feelings about the internet and its effect on our national culture but frankly those feelings are being countered by the sophistication kindness curiosity and wit of the posts in this site

9048764 during the second quarter we undertook a rationalization of our operations in order to reduce our cost structure and fully benefit from the synergies between our montreal paris and mexico offices our reorganization plan in line with the companys strategic plan is being implemented and we expect to see the benefits towards year end we have also repositioned our services offering in order to better align with the needs of our target customers and we are discontinuing some less profitable activities the private placement completed in july will allow the company to pursue its growth strategies
9048765 we have created in montreal a bi business solutions department this innovative and unique approach to the market strengthens our competitive advantage finally since the beginning of the year we are investing in the reinforcement of our business relations with some of our partners including sas and business objects both in canada and abroad
9048766 we have decided to focus on lower cost exploration projects in nevada and arizona we continue to seek a qualified joint venture partner for our king tonopah underground silver project located in nye county nevada we are actively pursuing additional acquisitions in arizona nevada and other accessible low cost and mining friendly jurisdictions in the southwest
9048767 our government is committed to supporting projects that help aboriginal young people acquire life skills for the future
9048768 these projects delivered within communities support aboriginal young people by equipping them to become future leaders and role models
9048769 they gain valuable life skills in an environment where they can also learn more about their traditional cultures and values
9048770 canadian heritage is a strong advocate for our aboriginal youth and we thank them for continuing to support programs that benefit our young people
9048771 through their continued funding the metis nation of alberta is able to provide valuable programs that teach our youth their culture and language these programs are a positive influence on our youth

9048776 we aim to solve the cyprus problem within 2008 we think that a solution is possible in this short time frame we will be at the table with all our good will
9048777 we think gov palin fits very well with hoosiers and main stream hoosier beliefs
9048778 here you have a leader who has been a mayor she has been a governor she has been a leader on things like energy independence
9048779 john mccain has defined this campaign about foreign policy experience and in his first big choice he has selected someone with zero zero foreign policy experience
9048780 governor and to have been chosen brings a great challenge
9048781 im sure hes trying to attract some of the female voters that feel disenfranchised because hillary clinton is no longer a candidate for them
9048782 i mean id like to hear what she has to say who am i to pass judgment on someone i dont know
9048783 definitely we need to introduce her to the american public no question about that

9048790 our goals for the user are for them to have the ability for maximum personalization and maximum choice
9048791 we want to offer customers options such as mobile tickets hard tickets through will call whatever they want
9048792 the fundamental problem with search today is that you have to know that an event is happening or a venue exists
9048793 so we tried to create a platform that preferentially tells you about events that you dont even know about but that youre interested in attending
9048794 everything came out the word would be awesome from our standpoint
9048795 everything was clean there were a number of tests and josh came thought with flying colors obviously we hoped for that we needed to get some closure
9048796 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9048797 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9048798 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9048799 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9048800 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9048801 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9048802 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9048803 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9048804 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9048805 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9048806 i personally believe that the single most important step we can take to resume a leadership role in international climate change efforts would be to make real progress toward a domestic emissions reduction regime for too long we have abdicated the responsibility to reduce our own emissions the largest single source of the problem we face today we have the worlds largest economy with the highest per capita emissions rather than leading by example we have retreated from international negotiations
9048807 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9048808 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9048809 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil
9048810 unfortunately with her support for drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coasts governor palin will simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil
9048811 now more than ever america is in need of real vision and leadership to bring us a new clean energy future and the mccain palin ticket offers nothing of the sort
9048812 we have roughly 10 of our volunteers in gaza and we have to get them
9048813 we need to get the passengers together hopefully within a month
9048814 this might be the beginning of a simple delivery service if we can set up the mechanisms here in cyprus this can be used as a model for what can be made more permanent
9048815 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9048816 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9048817 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment
9048818 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for
9048819 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9048820 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9048821 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9048822 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9048823 the greatest weakness of most humans is their hesitancy to tell others how much they love them while theyre alive
9048824 if you follow technology trends you have probably heard of the semantic desktop a data layer for annotating and sharing the information in your computer but what you may not be aware of is that the semantic desktop is not a distant goal but scheduled to arrive at the end of 2008 and when it does the idea will probably be implemented through the work done by the nepomuk project and most likely by kde first

9048828 im very fortunate that i didnt get caught up in it it was great to stand next to tony kanaan on the podium first and second hopefully we can do something similar again
9048829 its been a year of ups and downs and drama
9048830 its either been something on the track drawing attention or something off the track its just been like that this year
9048831 winning hasnt lessened the pressure to win again were shooting for no 1 every week its the other drivers who are making it hard on me the competition is very deep out there especially on the road courses its tough every single weekend
9048832 every year at the end you think if it wouldnt have been for that one thing
9048833 thats just the way it goes but you cant control it everybody has their bad races everybody has their throwaways thats what makes a season
9048834 obviously scott dixon is kicking everybodys butt and doing a good job this year
9048835 its difficult to pass on any road course really but here its not like you drop a wheel off in the gravel and keep going or get pushed wide you hit a wall
9048836 theres just nowhere to go i did a couple of them last year but they werent pretty a lot of crashes end up happening when you try the only other spot you can make up spots outside of actually passing would be through strategy through fuel saving through pit stops i think a lot of us tend to rely on strategy for the cleanest passing
9048837 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9048838 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9048839 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9048840 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9048841 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9048842 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9048843 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9048844 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9048845 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9048846 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9048847 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9048848 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9048849 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9048850 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9048851 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9048852 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9048853 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9048854 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9048855 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9048856 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9048857 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans

9048877 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9048878 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9048879 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9048880 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9048881 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9048882 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9048883 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9048884 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9048885 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9048886 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9048887 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9048888 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9048889 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9048890 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9048891 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9048892 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9048893 introduction to social bookmarking and excellent resources on how to achieve high ranking through social bookmarking
9048894 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9048895 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

9048897 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

9048899 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9048900 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9048901 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9048902 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9048903 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9048904 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9048905 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

9048919 the vast majority of children in centres dont need to be there
9048920 they have family the first priority therefore should be to reunite 80 per cent of the children in institutions with their families not to re open intercountry adoption

9048927 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9048928 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9048929 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9048930 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9048931 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9048932 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

9048947 i was very moved and im a hard core cynic i never thought i would see a person of color in this position in my lifetime
9048948 when i was growing up my school did not emphasize voting my parents didnt vote as an adult i got married and had children but after bush i realized it was vitally important to vote
9048949 its easy to be cynical about politics but listening to him does change that
9048950 ill open my house as long as its for obama
9048951 you are going to remember this night for the rest of your life

9048955 i just think he couldnt have come across any clearer
9048956 he talked about values the things that we want to see our kids having a good education our college kids being able to go and afford it and he talked about how he was going to pay for it
9048957 i think everybody should deserve an opportunity to be successful and he gives us the best chance to do that
9048958 most of us werent given a silver spoon and most of us had to work hard to get where were going and i think he resembles that a lot
9048959 he couldn t be better hes our future i truly believe hes our future
9048960 this country needs someone with his intelligence honesty and values
9048961 i feel strongly that this country needs to change direction
9048962 gives me hope that hell come home safer than if there was a commander in chief with the same mentality as what led us into this
9048963 for me it reaffirms my belief we can trust our leaders that a leader can make change happen
9048964 but i think we have made a lot of progress
9048965 i just think the outlook in this country will change

9049005 as we read and the longer we read we begin to get it
9049006 through reading the bible we see that there is far more to the world more to us more to what we see and more to what we dont see more to everything than we had ever dreamed and that this more has to do with god
9049007 this is new for many of us a different sort of book a book that reads us even as we read it we are used to picking up and reading books for what we can get out of them information we can use inspiration to energize us instructions on how to do something or other entertainment to while away a rainy day wisdom that will guide us into better living these things can and do take place when reading the bible but the bible is given to us in the first place simply to invite us to make ourselves at home in the world of god gods word and world and become familiar with the way god speaks and the ways in which we answer him with our lives
9049008 a book that reads us even as we read it

9049022 chapel hill on sept 18th that im told we have to wait a few more days to announce
9049023 simply the death of a child brings sadness in normal circumstances
9049024 if you were to add to this that our son had received so much abuse harm systematic torture and then in the end wrongful killing then you would get a better picture of what we feel
9049025 before we heard of his death we were hopeful he might be released any day and we were just awaiting his return
9049026 i really cannot find the words to express how that has impacted us
9049027 it would be inappropriate to provide significant advance notice to detainees regarding pending departures in the event plans could change with receiving nations among other concerns
9049028 our main focus is really the fact that the men were in the exclusive custody of the united states and the responsibility there is by virtue of that
9049029 i think the families want recognition of what they have suffered of the fact that their sons were wrongfully detained for four years without charge they want an apology which they have never had and they want closure
9049030 the government caused these deaths by first wrongfully detaining them and secondly in a most cowardly fashion refusing to acknowledge their mistake and immediately moving them out
9049031 they now say they were engaged in warfare against the united states if they died as enemies of this country we know who made them that
9049032 it is a government that has shown so much arrogance and misuse and abuse of power injustice and it has treaded over the rights of people and the feelings of people
9049033 during the past few years because of these practices it has generated so much hatred against it
9049034 the child is in custody and in the care of afghan authorities
9049035 the united states never assumed custody of the boy as part of our effort to confirm the identity and citizenship of the child the consular official from our embassy in kabul are initiating a consular visit to check on the child and his welfare
9049036 before we go into a theoretical what happens we should probably wait and see what the status is
9049037 first we need to confirm and find out and then we will take the next step
9049038 consistent with that of a potential offspring of aafia siddiqui
9049039 under afghan and international law ahmed siddiqui is too young to be treated as a criminal suspect
9049040 he should never have been transferred to the custody of afghanistans abusive intelligence agency
9049041 was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing

9049047 what we have seen and heard concerning christ we proclaim to you also
9049048 a proposition so related to another that though both may be false they cannot both be true

9049050 it may be stated categorically that no archaeological discovery has ever controverted a biblical reference
9049051 we can already say emphatically that there is no longer any solid basis for dating any book of the new testament after about a
9049052 how many early copies do we have and how close in time are they to the original
9049053 we have 13 000 manuscript copies of portions of the new testament
9049054 the interval then between the dates of original composition and the earliest extant evidence becomes so small as to be in fact negligible and the last foundation for any doubt that the scriptures have come down to us substantially as they were written has now been removed
9049055 i am the light of the world he who follows me shall not walk in the darkness but shall have the light of life and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
9049056 god so loved the world that he gave his only son so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life
9049057 above all the speech reflects on the role of the presidency and the qualities that are demanded by the job and makes the case that john mccain is the best qualified to be our next leader and commander in chief
9049058 do not expect the speech to define the presidents legacy
9049059 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments over the past seven and a half years american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama

9049081 we do have some graphics updates coming with wrath of the lich king namely in three areas shadow system shader technology and view distance
9049082 the shadow system will greatly improve the look of existing shadows and players will be able to display both character and structure shadows the new shader technology weve implemented enables the team to create even better looking terrain as well as some cool ice effects and the view distance has been increased so players will be able to see farther than ever before in northrend

9049141 la cobertura period stica de secuestros y las negociaciones que incluyen siempre es una de las m s complicadas tanto por la emotividad que incorpora como por la posibilidad de caer en imprecisiones y ese es el caso nos equivocamos al publicar el martes un reporte sobre las negociaciones para el rescate de silvia vargas escalera y hoy p blicamente presentamos disculpas a su familia

9049146 tampoco se deben ocultar las bajas y bajezas que produce el enemigo pero la informaci n no tiene por qu ser visual ning n medio que se respete aceptar a dinero de los criminales para hacerles propaganda y es igualmente inaceptable hacerla gratis los narcos los secuestradores los mercaderes de la prostituci n infantil los que asesinan ponen bombas o destruyen oleoductos para llamar la atenci n a favor de sus negocios o de sus buenas causas no tienen derecho a difundir sus comerciales

9049173 every month we call the heaviest and most disproportionate users its far less than 1 percent of all subscribers and ask them to curb their usage and most of the time those users do but people have asked to know what the threshold is so we wanted to determine that
9049174 we believe usage based pricing would be a welcome development for broadband providers and would be the simplest manifestation yet of what we believe is still the primary truth of the broadband market that is that demand is rising at a time when relevant supply is actually shrinking elementary economics would suggest that greater pricing power is the inevitable outcome
9049175 if you look at leading countries in broadband a lot of them have shied away from data caps
9049176 in denmark for example they dont have data caps carriers are increasingly deploying fiber optics and they offer speeds that are faster than anything you can get in the u s another example is japan its got one of the most robust fiber optic networks in the world and although one carrier recently did announce a cap it was 30 gb per day thats a really large number in a lot of countries carriers are taking an approach of abundance while in the u s theyre taking a scarcity approach
9049177 when youre talking about the network and how caps may affect investment in the market i dont know that wed have a position on that
9049178 isps have to design services in a way that allows people to access legal content and basically the fcc found that in the comcast throttling case the service provider arbitrarily blocked a specific application and had done so at all hours of the day and not just when there was congestion thats why we put the principles in place to make sure consumers could go anywhere to access legal content of their choosing we will review any concerns the public has on a case by case basis
9049179 i would like p4p to be part of comcasts plan i think its good for comcast and its good for comcast users

9049195 whats the insult is that diana degette still serves in office
9049196 diana degette and her ilk dont have anything in common with a successful governor of alaska who has fought hard to control government spending and to develop oil resources
9049197 i have never heard of her it is in my view still about what this election is all about that we cant have four more years of george bush
9049198 his selection of someone weve never heard of from alaska i dont think will change a thing for this election

9049251 oils gone up too much because people were buying it for all the wrong reasons like not wanting to hold on to the dollar or worrying about putting money in the bank

9049301 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9049302 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9049303 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate

9049312 the person who made me proudest of all though was half brother roy actually now we call him abongo his luo name for two years ago he decided to reassert his african heritage he converted to islam
9049313 there were enough of us on campus black students to constitute a tribe and when it came to hanging out many of us chose to function like a tribe staying close together traveling in packs
9049314 it remained necessary to prove which side you were on to show your loyalty to the black masses to strike out and name names
9049315 the emotion between the races could never be pure even love was tarnished by the desire to find in the other some element that was missing in ourselves whether we sought out our demons or salvation the other race would always remain just that menacing alien and apart
9049316 i had grown accustomed everywhere to suspicions between the races
9049317 this was upon leaning that some of his grandfathers people worked for whites
9049318 i found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mothers race
9049319 i have found that at princeton no matter how liberal and open minded some of my white professors and classmates try to be toward me i sometimes feel like a visitor on campus as if i really dont belong regardless of the circumstances under which i interact with whites at princeton it often seems as if to them i will always be black first and a student second
9049320 there was no doubt in my mind that as a member of the black community i am obligated to this community and will utilize all of my present and future resources to benefit the black community first and foremost
9049321 what we have learned over this year is that hope is making a comeback it is making a comeback and let me tell you something for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country and not just because barack has done well but because i think people are hungry for change
9049322 an obama presidency would not mark the end of racism though it may be a high water point in race relations
9049323 we bring in addition to all the rescue gear the ability to find people that will include search k 9s cameras listening devices optical devices anything that will pinpoint where people are trapped or missing
9049324 currently we have over 900 volunteers many of whom were trained up for hurricane katrina and are still trained and ready to go
9049325 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
9049326 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
9049327 its very very important that we play the way we practiced and trained over the last year and a half
9049328 theres a way that we operate theres a chain of command theres a way that we interact with each other and we cant afford to be in a disorganized way as we confront the challenges that were going to see here
9049329 this also impacts sports and social clubs its very much the fabric of the high street and the way we socialise and we lose that at our peril
9049330 we know that the kids who are out there getting drunk and getting involved in crime or ending up in accident and emergency are unlikely to be drinking in pubs chances are they have been tanked up on cut price alcohol
9049331 when alcoholic drinks are being sold at a price below water we are in a really bad place
9049332 in that zone you find disorder litter and threatening behaviour that is stimulated by cheap alcohol
9049333 its ridiculous to suggest that supermarkets are selling any significant proportion of alcohol at a loss no business could survive and certainly not thrive if they were doing that
9049334 we just have to try and make pubs more attractive
9049335 only 46 rather than the soon to be 53 years stated in running records either age is phenomenal for a marathoner
9049336 to their ancient homeland and israel has tried to keep her word bringing tens of thousands of people
9049337 this is a difficult time for most financial services firms and new star is no exception we do not expect conditions to improve significantly in the immediate future
9049338 i wonder if the leak in the times influenced the outcome it looks as if it did
9049339 i would like to take this opportunity to thank those of you that i know have worked hard to gather feedback from colleagues and it is important you know it was these views that have helped shape the counter proposal and the subsequent company response
9049340 desist from disciplining people who put information into the public domain
9049341 most borrowers would assume they stop paying interest when their mortgage is redeemed as it is not clear that an extra days interest is charged it is unfair and most borrowers are misled about this
9049342 on the day the customer switches from one deal to another credit has been extended by two different lenders so the borrower will normally have to pay interest to both for that day it is impractical to try to charge interest on an hourly basis
9049343 i am sorry weve had to increase our prices and weve made this decision extremely reluctantly especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much at the moment there is help available for people who cant afford to pay their bills and we want our customers to get in touch if theyre worried
9049344 we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers although we are one of the last companies to announce increases we are sorry we couldnt hold on any longer

9049346 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9049347 people see some of the things i do and they say why dont you show this to the world people dont know you do these things and maybe i will
9049348 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
9049349 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9049350 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
9049351 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time

9049354 as an industry we need to begin setting some basic common sense standards that reward pc gamers for purchasing our games
9049355 the console market effectively already has something like this in that its games have to go through the platform maker such as nintendo microsoft or sony but on the pc publishers can release games that are scarcely completed poorly supported and full of intrusive copy protection and then be stuck on it
9049356 this is an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to and ultimately so that we can provide our customers with the gaming experience that they have wanted for years and really deserve
9049357 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
9049358 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
9049359 they have been told to be ready to cut off supplies as soon as monday
9049360 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
9049361 they never say were going to cut off your oil because we dont like your foreign policy
9049362 there is a risk that they might do something like cutting oil to hurt the worlds democracies if they get angry enough
9049363 within a decade it will be very hard for russia to push us around
9049364 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it
9049365 from nationals point of view were ruling out working with new zealand first and winston peters
9049366 the reality is that winston peters faces investigation not only by the sfo but he also has to pass the test from the parliamentary privileges committee and then go on and answer all the other many and varied allegations which i would have thought if any of them are true would also be ruling him out as suitable to hold a ministerial warrant

9049395 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington
9049396 but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9049397 i know it will demand the best i have to give and i promise nothing less
9049398 i had promised todd a little surprise for the anniversary present
9049399 i havent met her before but she seems like a compelling person
9049400 im sure that she will help make the case for republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate
9049401 the achievements of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course sen hillary clinton who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign hillary left 18 million cracks in the hardest glass ceiling in america the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9049402 put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9049403 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9049404 actually achieving results whether its taking on corruption passing ethics reform or stopping wasteful spending and the bridge to nowhere senator obama has spent his time in office running for president
9049405 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9049406 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9049407 proves just how rigid and extreme his administration would be when it comes to a womans right to choose
9049408 it shows perhaps that hes a bit of a gambler that he was willing at this stage to roll the dice
9049409 its a tremendous risk to take someone of this little experience
9049410 shows that theyre making a concerted effort to go after women voters who are upset that barack obama passed over hillary clinton
9049411 a quintessential john mccain pick shes someone whos a reformer someone whos been a maverick
9049412 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell ya i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9049413 im used to being very productive and working real hard and in administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the u s before i can even start addressing that question
9049414 the administrator asked the program managers to evaluate this potential of flying through 2015

9049453 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove earwax called cerumen which serves an important protective function for the ear
9049454 cotton swabs and some other home remedies can push cerumen further into the canal potentially foiling the natural removal process and instead cause build up known as impaction
9049455 when cerumen builds to the point of causing symptoms such as pain ringing itching or hearing problems its a sign you should see a physician
9049456 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and include infections and hearing loss

9049537 since i joined the diplomatic service i have travelled all over the world and worked in countries thousands of miles away but i never forget where i am from so it is great to be returning and finding out what young people in burnley think about what line we should take in our inter national relations
9049538 my father used to collect gate money on the turnstiles and i used to stand on the longside so to return there was magical
9049539 its brought back so many good memories from the 1970s and with barry kilby and owen coyle at the helm we can do what stoke did last year and aspire to the premiership

9049551 the financials had a very good week particularly the earnings of the big six banks were definitely better than people were expecting so thats had a nice bid on the markets
9049552 and were going into a long weekend and im sure there are some people just straightening off their books before heading off
9049553 while yes it says things were worse than we actually thought then it doesnt necessarily tell us a lot about what happens next
9049554 the things that are interesting is that while growth has been slower than expected the things that are underlying it show a slowdown in consumer spending which is no surprise
9049555 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9049556 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9049557 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
9049558 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
9049559 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday

9049565 we do know the oil sands is a topic of debate and discussion in canada and we want to be an active part of that debate
9049566 we just feel that trespassing on a site and putting lives at risk isnt an effective way to debate
9049567 okay how does next friday work for you not good the following monday tuesday
9049568 performance as absolute and measurable as it might seem also has a lot of subtlety there are many elements and many tradeoffs involved in achieving performance that meets everyones expectations we know that even meeting expectations folks will want even more out of their windows pcs and thats expected weve re dedicated ourselves to work in this area in windows 7 and ie 8 this is a major initiative across each of our feature teams as well as the primary mission of one of our feature teams fundamentals
9049569 how much memory a given scenario allocates during a run as you know there is a classic tradeoff in time v space in computer science and were not exempt we see this tradeoff quite a bit in caches where you can use more memory or disk space in order to improve performance or to avoid re computing something
9049570 disk i o while hard drives have improved substantially in performance we still must do everything we can do minimize the amount that windows itself does in terms of reading and writing to disk including paging of course

9049588 were looking at a number of options regarding resectioning and redesigning
9049589 changes to the paper that we deliver youre constantly looking at that now but thats one of those things where when we come to a final decision ill be talking my readers and not yours first
9049590 something thats happened in the last 24 hours or is about to happen in the next 24 hours
9049591 que n o estava preparada para ter um torneiro mec nico como presidente da rep blica

9049597 the 5 0 thing puts a lot more extra pressure on us as it would take us up to second in the world rankings
9049598 that is the kind of pressure we want pressure is a privilege and if we win 5 0 it takes us right up to the top it is something we have talked about and if we deliver we can win 5 0 the dressing room is very happy place
9049599 we are putting pressure on their batters and playing to our potential were hitting their good balls for four and doing a really good job on them
9049600 i know south africa really well and they wanted to beat us they are very proud people and stubborn people
9049601 the cricket we are playing is not good cricket but england are playing unbelievable cricket they are one of the best one day sides we have played against recently
9049602 it has always been a dream to play for england as an individual you couldnt ask for more i played against south africa for the lions and although it was always going to be tough they knew i could bat
9049603 his recent form with the bat is another triumph for new captain kevin pietersen who has promoted the all rounder up the order and persuaded steve harmison a crucial figure in this series out of one day international retirement
9049604 with both crude and total oil product inventories running significantly lower than they were when either hurricanes katrina or rita sidelined gulf oil production both oil and gasoline prices are more exposed to potential storm related supply disruptions than they were three years ago
9049605 a comparable hit to production could easily send gasoline prices to new record highs with pump prices in the united states rising to us 5 per gallon and send natural gas prices spiking as well
9049606 the question is whether demand destruction can keep pace with the destruction in supply
9049607 while supply disruptions and attendant price hikes will be temporary there will be lasting impacts from hurricane damage on future supply growth as there have already been from the 2005 storm season
9049608 the general trend to gasoline prices would be flat to slightly lower reflecting a sort of underlying slowing global growth and therefore a slowdown in demand for crude oil
9049609 that should take a further froth off crude oil prices and allow for gasoline prices to slip a bit further
9049610 if there is damage to infrastructure if rigs are offline for more than just a few days for precautionary reasons then you could see oil and gasoline prices move upward temporarily
9049611 therefore it is somewhat striking that some central bankers still consider interest rates to be accommodative
9049612 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september
9049613 apple quickly released updates to fix 3g connectivity issues this year but consistently takes many months to release security updates
9049614 even when a user chooses to physically secure the device with a four digit passcode apple has chosen to still permit the user to use some functionality
9049615 by selecting to perform an emergency call the user can then gain access to other options which eventually leads them to near full access on the phone never having had to enter that passcode
9049616 this is an exceptionable security flaw that is not an acceptable risk for many enterprises and consumers alike
9049617 until apple begins to publicly address these fundamental design development and process issues enterprises will remain skeptical of the
9049618 that sent from my iphone kicker either makes this e mail completely legitimate or illegitimate
9049619 we are working on some bugs which affect around two percent of the iphones shipped and hope to have a software update soon
9049620 i dont mean to draw a conclusion based on this nitpicky observation but i just thought itd be interesting to point out
9049621 furthermore plans unless specifically designated for tethering usage cannot be used for any applications that tether the device through use of connection kits other phone pda to computer accessories including without limitation laptops or other equipment for any purpose

9049626 everything came out the word would be awesome from our standpoint
9049627 everything was clean there were a number of tests and josh came thought with flying colors obviously we hoped for that we needed to get some closure
9049628 belligerence and bravery are substantially driven by the benefits of conquest
9049629 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9049630 i came to the conclusion i really wanted to be here
9049631 i chose this program for a reason i am happy right now and ill just move forward
9049632 he still needs a few years to mature and we felt it was a better situation for matt
9049633 there was always a high probability he was going to be here
9049634 we were very patient through the process and if he was going to go we were prepared to move on without him
9049635 i think everyone feels the challenge of having a team that historically hasnt performed the way you want it to perform and trying to make that a valuable commodity
9049636 what we try to do is maximize everything around the game
9049637 if fans come and unfortunately the team doesnt do well theres a lot of other things going on that our fans can say that still made it worth my money to come to a mystics game
9049638 i think what people really like about the mystics brand is the accessibility of our players
9049639 they can engage a player on a more personal level than compared to other sporting endeavors in town with open practices and after game events the fact that we are a female sport also makes us different
9049640 i know greg has fielded a tremendous amount of calls from other teams as to what some of his best practices are theyve shown in a very short amount of time what kind of results a strong focus and good business strategy can bring
9049641 take the english language there are cats who come here from italy from germany from poland from france in two generations they speak english perfectly we have never spoken english correctly applause never have we spoken english correctly never never never and that is because our people consciously resisted a language that did not belong to us never did never will anyhow they try to run it down our throats we aint going to have it
9049642 no demands have been made so far by the hijackers

9049652 looking back at that occurrence for the first and last time it was a missed call
9049653 and it was not because doug eddings an umpire with 10 years experience and 10 before that in the minor leagues didnt know the application of the rule but just that in the moment in applying the rule he saw something he thought was more than it turned out to be

9049665 quicksilver improved performance by 250 percent at less than 1 20th the response time took up 1 5th the floor space and required only 55 percent of the power and cooling
9049666 performance improvements of this magnitude can have profound implications for business allowing two to three times the work to be completed in a given time frame for time sensitive applications like reservations systems and financial program trading systems and creating opportunity for entirely new insights in information warehouses and analytics solutions
9049667 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september
9049668 set the iphone so that double clicking the home button will take the user directly to the home screen which if password protection is turned on will be the unlock screen
9049669 these privileged identities which lie on hundreds of servers and applications very rarely get changed as it is often considered too much hassle when people leave the organisation they can often still access the network using these passwords to acquire an organisations most sensitive information
9049670 you can install the best security systems in the world but if your staff do not respect the information they are entrusted with then the information will definitely go astray just as the findings of this survey have illustrated
9049671 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses

9049675 if you chose to continue windows xp sp3 and ie8 beta2 will become permanent

9049678 it would not be fiscally prudent to take capacity away from core processors with a 100 ish 54 asp to service atom which have a 25 ish asp
9049679 capacity needed to be added and that can only be done so fast as one has to buy equipment install it and set up the appropriate factory lines etc

9049685 who will be the winner its always difficult to predict but from what i read its 5million that is the difference and at that level 5million doesnt make a difference any more
9049686 it usually finishes on august 31st with everybody going halfway and everybody thinking they are the winner
9049687 as ive said adebayor was committed first and he kept his word he said if i have a choice i want to stay and from the outside i only read the newspaper that doesnt look to be the case with berbatov
9049688 we are ready to stay up all night if it is needed
9049689 this season it is at midnight on september 1 so you never know we have still a long time to go
9049690 there is always an acceleration of signings you can see that when you watch tv for a while they talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour comes a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
9049691 we are out to look if we find the right player we will do it
9049692 his transfer saga and the fact he was wanted by all the clubs in europe was not down to him
9049693 it was down to his performances in the end he chose to stay here so why should it turn against him
9049694 we have to be realistic when a player like that is wanted it is as well an honour for arsenal the fact that he has decided to stay is an honour as well and the fact that he made financial sacrifices is an honour again
9049695 if he made some mistakes they were pr mistakes maybe but i like it when a football player is not pr because when they are they always have the right behaviour outside and the wrong inside i prefer the reverse situation
9049696 in adebayors case he made maybe a little pr mistake but for what is really important the way he practised the way he worked the way he behaved on a daily basis it is credit to him and i think we have to be intelligent enough the fans as well to support him

9049735 president morales a former grower of coca the raw ingredient of cocaine is both an antagonist and an active partner in american antidrug policy for the region
9049736 yet he has also gone to unexpected lengths to restrain coca cultivation and he accepts about 30 million a year from the united states almost his entire antinarcotics budget to fight cocaine
9049737 for now mr morales and the united states remain uneasy bedfellows mr morales has been hesitant to sever ties with the united states especially since it provides bolivia with about 100 million in development aid each year it also grants duty free access for bolivian textiles an economic lifeline for his country
9049738 the american backed anti narcotics special forces known as the leopards go about their job each day at dawn eight man teams in camouflage snake out of a military base here in new nissan patrol sport utility vehicles driving down dirt roads into the jungle then they get out and walk chopping through brush with machetes grasping m 16 rifles in search of small mobile coca mashing factories that have pushed bolivian cocaine production to a 10 year high when they find one they set it ablaze

9049796 das r ttelt an den fundamenten der internationalen ordnung die milit risch vorbereitete anerkennung einer ausl ndischen provinz ist mehr als eine einmischung in die inneren angelegenheiten eines anderen staates damit wird v lkerrecht gebrochen russland verneint und verletzt die territoriale souver nit t und integrit t georgiens alle rechtstreuen staaten m ssen jetzt zusammenstehen sie d rfen die neue lage nicht dulden das mindeste ist kollektiver protest m glich sind auch sanktionen die in verh ltnism igen grenzen als antwort auf die v lkerrechtsverletzung sogar rechtswidrig d rfen niemand darf russland auf diesem weg folgen schlie lich steht eine grundlage der internationalen ordnung auf dem spiel
9049797 russland kann zurzeit die muskeln spielen lassen weil nato und eu sich schwertun eine einheitliche linie zu finden zwar k nnen die europ er nicht einfach hinnehmen dass moskau die territoriale integrit t georgiens mir nichts dir nichts ber den haufen wirft aber sie stecken in einem dilemma ber druckmittel um moskau zur raison zu rufen verf gen sie nicht weder der entzug der strategischen partnerschaft noch die verweigerung eines wto beitritts d rften moskau nachhaltig beeindrucken der kreml ist auf krawall gestimmt und h lt konfrontation f r ein zeichen politischer st rke
9049798 falls es irgendeinen zweifel ber die motivation russlands gab den krieg mit georgien zu f hren wurde er gestern ausger umt der russische pr sident dmitri medwedew hat die unabh ngigkeit von s dossetien und abchasien anerkannt es ist allen klar dass diese entscheidung schon beim einrollen der russischen panzer in dieses land feststand europa und seine verb ndeten stehen in der pflicht die territoriale integrit t georgiens zu verteidigen eines demokratischen nachbarns dem man dringend das tor zur nato ffnen muss au erdem m ssen die f hrungskr fte der eu von worten zu taten bergehen und sehr viel h rtere ma nahmen ergreifen solange moskau nicht auf den weg der legalit t zur ckkehrt
9049799 die einen erkl ren es sei kl ger den russischen b r zu beruhigen die anderen behaupten dass er unbedingt in schach gehalten werden muss die stimme der ersten l sst sich vor allem im alten europa h ren die zweiten befinden sich mehrheitlich in gro britannien sowie in polen und anderen l ndern europas die das sowjetische joch erleiden mussten die auseinandersetzung ist noch nicht abgehakt aber ohne zweifel hat europa ein russisches problem der moskauer imperialismus ist sogar eine der wichtigsten herausforderungen der es anfang dieses jahrhunderts begegnen muss
9049800 wer dar ber berrascht ist kann in den vergangenen monaten nicht zugeh rt haben seit kosovo nicht die aufwertung dieser einst serbischen region zum staat hat den herren an der moskwa ein argument geliefert wladimir putin hat seit langem angesagt wie der russische b r l uft auf der f hrte der gro macht dem beispiel der bush regierung folgend es war ein fehler die ank ndigungen und warnungen des damaligen russischen pr sidenten f r blo e rhetorik zu halten
9049801 die anerkennung abchasiens und s dossetiens als selbstst ndige staaten durch russlands pr sidenten macht eine verhandlungsl sung in georgien noch schwieriger stellt sie doch die vermittelnden m chte also die mehrheit der eu staaten vor vollendete tatsachen immerhin hatte der sechs punkte plan der eu gespr che dar ber vorgesehen wie sicherheit und stabilit t in abchasien und s dossetien hergestellt werden k nnten solche verhandlungen k nnen jetzt als einmischung in die inneren angelegenheiten zur ckgewiesen werden auch eine durch den weltsicherheitsrat zu beschlie ende friedensmission der uno liegt jetzt in weiter ferne aber jetzt die verhandlungen ber die georgienkrise einzustellen und auf eine allgemeine konfrontationslinie zu russland einzuschwenken w re ein fataler fehler
9049802 russland spielt europa der nato dem westen deren eigene melodie vor was euch kosovo ist ist uns abchasien und s dossetien das perfide daran dass russland wie der martialische umgang mit tschetschenien bewiesen hat die rechte von minderheiten ziemlich gleichg ltig sind vorrang hat das bem hen wieder ein st ck alter territorialer und imperialer st rke zur ckzugewinnen und was kann es f r russland sch neres geben als sich dabei westlich zivilgesellschaftlicher argumente zu bedienen man wei nun das war vermutlich nur der anfang
9049803 wie russland und der westen aus dieser tiefsten krise seit dem zerfall der sowjetunion wieder herausfinden wollen ist ungewiss dies ist der freie fall und er geschah weil moskau auf eindrucksvolle weise vorf hrt wie man milit risch siegen aber politisch untergehen kann regierung und pr sident brechen lustvoll br cken ab die sie m hsam aufgebaut haben moskau will der weltgemeinschaft seine regeln diktieren aber das wird russland f r alles gas und l der welt kaum gelingen stattdessen hat es sich in eine sackgasse man vriert in der bereits kompromisse wie niederlagen wirken aber den weg hinaus muss moskau alleine finden
9049804 medwedew hat vor allem deutschland und seinen au enminister steinmeier br skiert noch vor wenigen wochen hatte der einen friedensplan f r abchasien vorgelegt mit ausdr cklicher zustimmung moskaus medwedew zog nun den propagandaerfolg vor eigenem publikum der zusammenarbeit mit deutschland vor einem der letzten kooperationswilligen partner in europa
9049805 was aber wollen die europ er der russischen f hrung berhaupt beweisen sanktionen oder eine eiszeit werde es nicht geben haben bernard kouchner und angela merkel der franz sische au enminister und die deutsche kanzlerin schon angek ndigt zu wichtig ist russland als gesch ftspartner die gefahr ist dagegen gro dass die 27 mit gro em pomp der welt ihre uneinigkeit und entschlusslosigkeit zeigen es w re ja nicht das erste mal der eu sondergipfel zur lage in georgien kann zu einem moralischen appell werden einer gemeinsamen besinnung auf den wert der politischen freiheit einer solidarit tsbekundung f r ein land das teil der nachbarschaftspolitik der union ist

9049822 what i wasnt sure of was how charismatic a speaker he would be
9049823 obama was kind of winging it that was how he was doing things back then
9049824 there was certainly a risk for the dnc and kerry because obama had never given a speech of that magnitude before
9049825 i was arguing with her about trying to give money to kerry she said she had to save her money for her friend barack
9049826 kerry said he didnt care about about obamas future prospects for him the future was now

9049937 i talked to him today and hes very very confident hell be able to play he looks a lot better and is moving better today
9049938 im just going out there trying to get better every day
9049939 ive been like that my entire life no matter whatever situation ive been in
9049940 os factos n o corroboram essa interpreta o deste evento
9049941 n o fazia ideia que eras t o est pido
9049942 its great for the base im pretty sure shes a buchananite
9049943 sono stato dai dottori e mi hanno detto che potrebbe essere stata causata dai movimenti della mia moto di fatto mi sono fratturato lo scafoide gi rotto nel 2003
9049944 mi sono fatto male esattamente nello stesso punto e fa parecchio male sar costretto a fasciarlo per le sessioni di domani
9049945 possiamo essere molto pi veloci per questo siamo contenti le cose che abbiamo provato a brno stanno lavorando bene su questo tracciato
9049946 ci aspetta come sempre un campionato molto importante ei direttori di gara vogliono essere
9049947 questo gruppo di assoluto valore si presenta assolutamente compatto ben messo e preparato
9049948 if youre not a part of the executive branch then you cant claim executive privilege so if you dont mind well be having a look at those energy task force minutes
9049949 they were also the guys who created the first government by the people for the people
9049950 they built a beautiful framework that led to the ending of slavery better womens rights than most of the rest of the world and a freedom of speech
9049951 this administration doesnt torture logic it merely flies logic in an unmarked plane to bulgaria what happens after that
9049952 can dick cheney make something so secret that even he does not know about it
9049953 the president is also not part of the executive branch
9049954 does not have to answer questions beyond those on the floor
9049955 oh wait wait presidents rules now because were under a national security
9049956 i would but you wouldnt be surprised by the names anyway
9049957 to understand what is going on requires a little understanding into how the market is functioning what is happening is that private capital is being poured into a large number of high profit housing ventures to be high profit they must be luxury as while you can make money from building affordable housing you can make a whole lot more from luxury projects to build anything significant you require planning permission from the local authorities they then act as a regulator of housing to ensure that what is being built matches the plans for the area and so theoretically at least benefits bristol and its people however that regulatory role seems to have been overlooked in a rush to attract investment into the city
9049958 in a loft that was a converted ice factory it had 40 foot ceilings it was gorgeous
9049959 everything that has ever portrayed our world has gotten it insultingly wrong
9049960 the portrayal of public defenders is as schlubby disillusioned generally incompetent people who cant get other jobs the reality is that my bronx office hired people from harvard and yale nobody believes it
9049961 the truth is i was between roles just being lazy and letting it grow out when i came onto this project both stephen and david wanted me to keep it long i think it really suits jerry david told me he really did go to trial with long hair so its not out of the realm of possibility
9049962 however the information on the firearm was not entered as stolen on leaps due to the lack of a serial number but was broadcasted on cjis as a stolen firearm
9049963 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
9049964 i think we not only jumped the shark long ago i think were inventing new sharks
9049965 were taking it to a whole new level fasten your seatbelts
9049966 i t keeps it interesting first and foremost most other tv shows are in the habit of figuring out their winning formula and then beating it into the ground whereas we take what we already know works and toss it out the window at the start of every season which i think is very bold and ambitious and it certainly provides a new playground for the actors
9049967 that said ive been more comfortable with some seasons than others my favorites so far has been one and three because i actually think that my character works best behind bars with very real physical deadly obstacles to surmount whereas second season was a total change of pace and a real downshift for me and was one of my least favorite seasons because it felt as though my character was literally and figuratively riding shotgun much more reactive than active that can be frustrating but like i said its most important for a show thats running 67 episodes at this point to keep it as fresh and as exciting for the actors as possible
9049968 i think that michael is still a good man but at this point i think it would take something quite extreme for him to really even the score because in order for his brother to go free so many people have died in the process and i think that weighs terribly on michaels conscience
9049969 once this experience is over once say they successfully destroy the conspiracy there is no returning to his white collar existence as a structural engineer i mean i think the only thing that michael is kind of fit for at this point is as a hired gun which actually dovetails quite nicely with the directions he takes
9049970 well its not csi its not law amp order it cant run forever
9049971 i do feel as though we may be on one of our final laps around the track it is something that weighs on my mind from time to time telling a story correctly necessitates knowing when to end it at this point in the series michael and lincoln between them have intentionally or unintentionally killed so many people and yet theyre still running around with t bag its really a testament to robert knepper that his character has survived through four whole seasons but the man is a maniac a psychopath and a child killer and a rapist and yet he and the boys are still digging ditches together eventually you have to wonder when is enough enough because it really makes my character look bad these are the questions that i think eventually we have to answer or else suffer a fall off in terms of believability and quality
9049972 i think that we address it as plausibly as possible it helps that the show is kind of fantastic and i feel like weve gotten away with worse but at the same time we do provide an explanation and we dont tease the audience its not a flash of saras ponytail disappearing down an ally for the first episodes everyone wondering when shell actually make a face to face with michael shes back first episode michael and sara reunited and then the gang hits the ground running because theres work to do
9049973 the tattoo is addressed pretty definitively in the very first episode its funny it was a fan favorite the first season but then michael escaped mission accomplished suddenly it was just something that kind of had to be born rather than be something that could be used as a plot device that resulted in me in dallas in 120 degree heat wearing long sleeve shirts because were still pretending that i actually have the damn thing on i appreciated the tattoo and i think its addressed in the first episode of season four as something thats kind of emblematic of michaels experience that this is an experience that has left its mark its not something that can be easily washed off and it speaks to the fact that michael is now a changed man inside and out
9049974 i think id bring back paul adelstein i thought he was a fantastic agent kellerman and i thought was symbolic of the kind of character that the show does best which is someone living within the shades of gray not entirely black not entirely white not entirely good not entirely evil but someone who is complicated as we all are in real live i think paul really did a beautiful job of defining a character who could be vicious one minute and entirely sympathetic the next hes very much missed
9049975 would you like to buy some real estate on mars or the moon no this would not be the equivalent of buying the brooklyn bridge at least according to a review of legal precedents and treaties published in the journal of air law and commerce the authors alan wasser and douglas jobe of the space settlement institute conclude that the international outer space treaty prohibits nations from claiming sovereignty over the moon or mars it does not preclude private land claims and they point to legal precedents establishing the necessary condition for anyone making a land claim living there
9049976 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl
9049977 im hoping that this leads definitely to that this whole process is basically you scratch my back ill scratch yours
9049978 the greatest end zone dance of all time has to be
9049979 cest vraiment excitant je suis un peu nerveux avoue guillaume asselin le choix de premi re ronde de l quipe au plus r cent rep chage a para t quand jembarque sur la glace les jambes me tremblent un peu cest nervant mais jai tr s h te de jouer un match

9049983 just minutes after hearing the news i received a call from dee sarton with channel 7 news in boise she asked how i was doing and my immediate response was ecstatic that has been my response all day ive got an extra hitch in my giddy up as i head to minneapolis for the republican national convention with my fellow idaho delegates
9049984 from the national perspective this is a bold strategic masterpiece im pretty sure the obama camp never saw this one coming certainly not idaho democrats
9049985 trails kc plan a comprehensive trails system for kansas city missouri
9049986 without an adopted trails plan the city has little guidance and cohesiveness in identifying trail corridors which has created major impediments to the development of a successful trail system
9049987 now papa has found peace and maybe we can find peace in our lives too
9049988 as for lindsay i fully expect lindsay and my other three children to be at the wake and funeral
9049989 when people in the neighborhood found out that the space was going to be a bookstore bags of books started showing up at the front door
9049990 we decided that these books would be placed on a cart that we keep in front of the store and that all sales of donated books would be given to chase brexton health services
9049991 this past february we started offering entertainment on friday and saturday evenings
9049992 we feature original singer songwriters our next performance is scheduled for august 29 when the group vote yourself a farm will be on our stage
9049993 after experiencing a decade of downsizing during the reagan administration i got the idea to try do to all i could to become self employed
9049994 since ive always loved books and reading and coffee i thought that a bookstore coffeehouse would be the perfect solution
9049995 the mission of the business is to support and enhance the creative community and hopefully to do a little good along with way
9049996 customers often tell me that the bookstore makes them feel like they are in their own living room others have said that being there is just like paris or london either way it is great to hear that people feel at home at read street books
9049997 our book selection is rather eclectic we have something for everyone one
9049998 basically if i think the book is interesting and would like to read it i get it
9049999 you may not find the books that are listed on the new york times best sellers list but you will find books that will get you thinking and entertain
