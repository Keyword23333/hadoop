8710144 passing definitely needs work we have the hitters so we need to get them the ball
8710145 we had a good result and we had a not so good result

8710153 at the end of day its about a mother with young children who is dealing with a horrendous disease
8710154 soccer will come and go but real life is always there our team is excited to help out

8710161 we have a really great student body and needed to fire up the whole school
8710162 you know its a great win for skyline and a great win for the team i thought the kids played real hard with intensity and had a great attitude
8710163 they really gave it their all and they need to do that every week bring that kind of high intensity
8710164 winning the first game of the year is always a clutch its the first week of school and kids are all excited but on the opposite side its always hard to lose that first one cause it takes the air out of the sails it makes coaching the kids a lot easier and the spirit around the school is immensely positive

8710191 alta is one of the best teams in the state
8710192 our offseason along with our experience helped us they didnt get themselved down when they were down by a couple scores and i think thats maturity from a lot of these guys playing last year as underclassmen and they were able to draw from that experience keep their heads up and come back
8710193 i signed up to defend our nation if we went to state i would be thrilled in the long run i need to concentrate on that but as of right now im focused on football and getting our team into state
8710194 the further we go on in the season the better well get we just need to tweak a few things here and there and execute we have the kids that can do it but its about getting them in the right place at the right time it just comes down to the timing
8710195 i was really happy with how the first week went we didnt have many mental mistakes
8710196 this is the best way to get out of the gate since ive been here as far as pure execution on both sides of the ball
8710197 in all my years of high school football ive never seen anything like what i saw with our return game we had another return touchdown called back on a penalty
8710198 the passing was not as existent as i wouldve liked there are some other things here and there willie played very good at times and looked bad in others his running was outstanding his blocking wasnt thats what preseasons for the goal is for woods cross to get better
8710199 coach russ jones does a good job diversifying things theyre a good team with 22 returning starters its going to be a battle

8710205 number one we have to take care of the football
8710206 physically we got after it we just made crucial mistakes
8710207 but were not about to press the panic button its just back to work
8710208 those two kids thought of themselves and not the team
8710209 theyll get back in the lineup if they deserve it but for now they are in the doghouse with me
8710210 i think im going to be a leader on the team not just on the court but off the court
8710211 ill have to be there and be smart it will be a lot of pressure for sure but im pretty good with pressure
8710212 we went to an orphanage and gave a clinic and taught them how to play volleyball it just made me feel how much stuff we have here

8710215 she can pound the ball but shes also smart shes more of an all around hitter she can change the speed if she needs to
8710216 i dont think im totally stacked but i have really good players working hard every day
8710217 we have a couple of big positions to fill but weve got some players that can step up and do the job and theres never a position that cant be filled with someone else we have good kids to pick from
8710218 we dont have the drama weve had in the past
8710219 the cliques are gone and weve been working really well as a team
8710220 we need a good show before we head to 5a
8710221 we want to place at least as well as we did last year

8710247 though never a supporter of obama i admired him for a time for his ability to engage our imaginations and especially for his ability to inspire the young once again to embrace the political system
8710248 i do not think there is unanimous appetite for it imposing sanctions on russia
8710249 we cant go on with business as usual but that doesnt mean no business that wouldnt help anybody isolation and confrontation is not what we want
8710250 i highly doubt it might ever happen it imposing sanctions would be more to the detriment of the eu than to russia
8710251 the management of alitalia will remain in the hands of italians
8710252 prospective foreign partners will take a stake in the new company only as minority shareholders
8710253 we have avoided the solution proposed by the previous government which would have seen alitalia sold off cheaply to the national company of italys main competitor in international tourism
8710254 we had a duty to do something we have done something concrete we have succeeded
8710255 air france klm confirms its interest and its wish to continue as the strategic partner for alitalia
8710256 with this in mind and if prospects for the new company are confirmed air france klm is ready to take a minority stake in the capital of the new company alongside the investors gathered together by italian bank intesa sanpaolo

8710276 it was hard watching it because marty gave new meaning to the phrase conservative pilot
8710277 he would spend 45 minutes during pre flight inspecting stuff when most guys spend about 10 minutes
8710278 i kept my eye on the plane the whole time specifically because i knew it was marty
8710279 marty was a great guy a nice friendly warm guy
8710280 its been a while since i saw him its so sad
8710281 it was a shock all that black smoke i didnt know where it was coming from
8710282 i highly doubt it might ever happen it imposing sanctions would be more to the detriment of the eu than to russia
8710283 i hope reason and common sense will prevail i can expect eu leaders will be able to rise above emotions of the day
8710284 it is strange to hear about the disproportionate use of force from those who only nine years ago bombed a european capital

8710290 today it is essential that the eu speaks with one voice that is strong and firm on georgia
8710291 the hope that this crisis will simply pass and that we can go back to business as usual is very naive
8710292 it is utopian to think of a partnership agreement with russia now if georgias territorial integrity is not guaranteed then were thrown back 40 years
8710293 i highly doubt it might ever happen it imposing sanctions would be more to the detriment of the eu than to russia
8710294 i am not a fan of sanctions now is the time for talks but we should have concrete moves in our pocket
8710295 poland will want the eu summit to make the commitment to ukraine and the caucasus states as tangible as possible
8710296 they will think it is the only guarantee against the potential threat posed by russia

8710301 since there is no rational basis for requiring a catering truck to be moved half a mile every 60 minutes or every 30 minutes this attempt to restrict the operation of the catering trucks from the location at which they would prefer to be parked is a pretext for creating a naked restraint of trade and as such must be invalid
8710302 hey wait a second this isnt right so your mortgage is defaulted
8710303 we were told to have faith in god country and one another most of us did but the last of these faith in one another was our final defense the ramparts our enemy could not cross in prison as in any of wars endeavors your most important allegiance is to the men you serve with we were obligated to one another and for the duration of our war that obligation was our first duty the vietnamese knew this they went to great lengths to keep us apart knowing we had great strenth in unity
8710304 today at odd times i find myself becoming quite sentimental about america in the distant past that was not how my patriotism typically found expression i attribute much of my emotion to the good people of orange park florida i no longer think of the countrys character in abstract terms now when i think about americans and how fortunate i am to be included in their number i see the faces of our neighbors in orange park and give thanks that by a lucky accident of birth i was born an american
8710305 no one who goes to war believe once he is there that it is worth the terrible cost of war to fight it by half measures was is too horrible a thing to drag out unnecessarily it was a shameful waste to ask men to suffer and die the persevere through awful afflictions and heartache for a cause that half the country didnt believe in and our leaders werent committed to winning they committed us to it badly misjudged the enemys resolve and left us to manage the thing on our own without authority to fight it to the extent necessary to finish it
8710306 no other national endeavor requires as much unshakable resolve as war if the government and the nation lack that resolve it is criminal to expect men in the field to carry it alone we were accountable to the country and no one was accountable to us

8710322 if you have a problem with the merchandise you can call corporate
8710323 this is black face thats what it is a menestral show
8710324 no that wasnt a typo sister actually said menestral i dont know if she meant a show that was on its menstrual cycle or if she meant a minstrel show
8710325 weve got a couple centermen that we think are going to be nhl players
8710326 i think weve got a decent mix of centers defensemen
8710327 when we drafted him we knew that being a big guy he had to get his quickness improved and hes addressed that and hes going to address it this summer
8710328 hes assured us hes going to work very hard this summer his body has grown so fast that maybe his muscles havent kept up with his bones hes got a real good stride viktor kozlov a big guy that skates well and moves the puck well his maturing level is at 24 25 years old when he gets there he might be at 230 240 pounds
8710329 he probably thinks he needs to get back and get stronger
8710330 hes realizing hes not far off his dream you can tell how badly he wants it his determination is good hes got such good all around hockey skills hes a smart poised player hes not a flashy player but hes in the right place hes got incredible hockey sense
8710331 in the organizations mind hes going to need some seasoning in the american hockey league
8710332 but he made great strides last summer so who knows what hes capable of
8710333 were not going to send him back to junior as an over ager
8710334 he signed last fall he was that impressive in training camp we envision him probably starting the year in wilkes barre and getting some seasoning
8710335 with dustin he needs to work on his quickness and his overall strength
8710336 those two things are whats probably followed him around the last couple years we just saw too much skill and too much hockey sense to overlook his quickness improved and we dont think hes near the peak of what his skating will be the next couple years
8710337 casey is behind the curve a little bit as far as the plan that was kind of mapped out for him
8710338 if he has a good summer and impressed in the fall hell be eligible to play in wilkes barre
8710339 i think casey has to improve his quickness and learn to play at a higher pace be on the move more often he played a couple years in tier ii which was a little slower and he could control the pace hes very good at protecting the puck but he really didnt have to turn his feet over like he would as he climbs to various levels
8710340 hes really clever with the puck he protects the puck well he moves the puck well
8710341 we thought he could slide because hes got to learn to be more committed defensively and maybe work a little harder on the ice in both directions not just offensively
8710342 for him the issue coming out of college minnesota was getting stronger
8710343 i think hes addressed that or hes showing that he can compete for a job at the strength he has right now but after going through a whole season plus playoffs in the american hockey league hes realized he has to get a lot stronger hes an exciting talent pittsburgh really covets him hes a guy thats knocking on the door
8710344 he was drafted with a bit of offense to him but hes projected to be an all around defenseman
8710345 puck decisions getting his feet quicker in the defensive zone thats where were looking for him to improve hes got size hes not piling up the points in college but hes making strides
8710346 its what role does his coaching staff envision for him in the next couple years
8710347 in college a player has to wait until his junior or senior year if he does have those offensive capabilities hes got to wait for his opportunity i envision him having some more development time in college
8710348 what really jumps out with brian is leadership capabilities and determination
8710349 he does a lot of things well not one thing exceptionally well just does a lot of things well everywhere hes gone hes been a quality teammate his leadership and work ethic rubs off on other people
8710350 its just time for him to improve a little bit of everything
8710351 get a little quicker puck decisions but hes a solid defensive defenseman were still wondering if theres a little bit more offense under the surface than hes shown so far
8710352 but when we see the end product he could be a guy playing at 225 or 230 hes got a good work ethic he doesnt get beat one on one he has good puck skills i dont envision him being an offensive defenseman but his passing is above average
8710353 we liked his skating ability his tenacity he moves the puck pretty well
8710354 the issue with him is strength and maybe develop his offensive game
8710355 hes a guy that hoped to have a better season this year
8710356 he had a solid career at notre dame maybe its going to take a bit for him to find his way but we still consider him a prospect
8710357 our evaluations on him have been really really good all year
8710358 just because of where he comes from and the ambiguity in that situation hes another guy that we thought might fall to us and when it got to the fifth round we said were not letting this guy go any further
8710359 i feel that a woman in some way has to live with the phenomenon of becoming pregnant
8710360 when she does not want to keep the product of the pregnancy she still has to suffer the effects during the whole period
8710361 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8710362 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8710363 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8710364 it feels good man you know to get a second chance and i just have to take advantage of it
8710365 first and foremost i dont want to let myself down definitely my little girl down im thankful for jerry jones the fans in dallas and my teammates for believing in me i need to keep doing what ive been doing to get reinstated staying with myself and my teammates and staying away from those knuckleheads and just stay focused
8710366 i never thought it would take this long but im just glad im getting another chance
8710367 how much how much come make a bid is all your money spent
8710368 i know its value all too well my baby died last year and if the owner of the chair our friend the mortgagee objects to this proceeding let him send the bill to me
8710369 if as the ethics application form states consent was obtained from all subjects how is it that i did not know about my aids status until 1987
8710370 i did not know anything about his studies or research
8710371 that i was probably all over this news like a rash

8710416 anwar whatever we think of him and many of us are deeply skeptical is looking more and more like our future prime minister
8710417 there is a mounting sense of inevitability to his impending succession

8710419 so theres no point in staying and participating in this debate
8710420 permatang pauh has given a clear signal to the leadership of this country we demand change we want freedom we dont want to live with corruption and oppression
8710421 it is anwar versus the entire government god willing i am confident of winning
8710422 it was his home ground so that was always an advantage because he has a lot of support there
8710423 we expected him to win this just proves there is nothing wrong with our electoral system but i still doubt he will be able to pull off his sept 16 threat
8710424 it is a lie to smear him the government is doing everything they can to shame him

8710617 whatever they ask from me ive got to do each week youve got to prepare to be the starter anyway so thats how youve got to go with it
8710618 regresamos mal la verdad es que no merec amos ese resultado siento que se hab a jugado muy ordenado que se le jug de t por t tambi n nosotros tuvimos nuestras oportunidades desgraciadamente esto no es de merecer es de quien mete los goles y santos hizo lo suyo
8710619 sabemos que si seguimos jugando de esa manera es m s l gico que se vengan los buenos resultados nos enfrentamos a un equipo que tiene de media cancha hacia adelante mucha velocidad es muy explosivo y creo que tuvimos mucho orden desgraciadamente el dos a cero fue por la desesperaci n de ir a buscar el empate
8710620 sin duda nos ocupa rodallega tenemos claras sus virtudes es un tipo que se ha adaptado bien a necaxa y que le ha dado goles es el l der del torneo y trataremos de tener mucha coordinaci n defensiva para contrarrestarlo a l y al resto del equipo las distancias entre los dos equipos no son tran grandes as que debemos de pensar en que no podemos aflojar y hay que seguir fiel a la idea de pelear cada punto para permanecer en los primeros lugares del grupo y de la tabla general
8710621 yo creo que algo muy claro en el futbol es que todos los equipos pueden ganar necaxa no ha encontrado la regularidad en sus resultados pero sigue siendo un equipo con jugadores s lidos y con oficio sin duda sabemos que el partido en casa ser complicado y debemos de mejorar mucho para sacar un buen resultado
8710622 el estilo de necaxa ha cambiado mucho en los ltimos a os me parece que es un equipo que plantea bien los partidos y que tiene mucha experiencia y ello lo hace complicado afortunadamente hemos tenido una buena rotaci n de elementos entre los torneos y la carga de trabajo no ha sido tan pesada
8710623 es similar a cuando jugamos contra pachuca ellos los atlistas est n un poco necesitados de puntos han sacado empates contra atlante ganaban 0 2 y los empataron contra am rica tambi n sacaron el empate est n un poco desanimados en ese sentido y nosotros contra debemos aprovechar eso al m ximo como hicimos contra pachuca sacar un buen resultado en cu
8710624 ellos tienen la necesidad de sacar un buen resultado creo que van a arriesgar un poco m s y hay que tratar de aprovechar es un equipo muy compacto que si se llega a desesperar puede dejar espacios atr s que pueden aprovechar los jugadores r pidos que tenemos
8710625 s puede ser una ventaja porque jugamos al mediod a y con el calor podemos estar un poco m s descansados que ellos que jugaron ayer pero tampoco es una gran ventaja antes que nada hay que respetar al rival y hacer un buen trabajo
8710626 lo que m s queremos es empezar ganando el s bado ya que siempre venimos de atr s y eso desespera un poco ya que s lo hemos iniciado un partido siempre arriba ante tecos y se hace dif cil jugar contra el marcador es un detalle que habr que corregir en conjunto desde la porter a hasta los que buscan los goles arriba sabemos que necaxa es un buen equipo y que tiene buena defensa que tiene al goleador del torneo y por ello debemos de mentalizanos
8710627 puede ser que el duelo sea dif cil porque vendr n por los puntos despu s de perder ayer en casa nosotros y mantenernos en entre los l deres de la competencia y creo que lo podremos conseguir si seguimos sobre nuestros pasos mejorando cada semana
8710628 creo que hay muchos jugadores buenos en el equipo que son protagonistas yo me siento bien y es para esto para lo que uno est para jugar bien y que el conjunto gane y que bueno que se est llegando a ello ojal y el fin de semana se siga de esta manera la continuidad a todos los jugadores nos ayuda para meter goles y todos la necesitamos para tomar ritmo de partido y yo la tuve desde la pretemporada y me ha hecho muy bien

8710639 bueno formativo en su preparaci n a la hora de competir es competitivo entonces realmente nosotros debemos de preocuparnos por hacer bien las cosas nosotros y no tanto por lo que el rival nos vaya a proponer o qui nes vengan a jugar nosotros debemos de ser muy serios en nuestro trabajo al salir a la cancha hacer las cosas muy bien

8710702 belum pernah sejarah mencatat suatu peristiwa yang lebih dahsyat dari penghancuran tentara gabungan mesir dan perancis dari pantai mesir oleh hanya seribu pasukan berkuda
8710703 kaum muslimin memegang teguh perjanjiannya sedangkan golongan nasrani memberi isyarat untuk memulai lagi peperangan

8710709 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8710710 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8710711 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it

8710714 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products

8710718 the 2 percent increase in total u s store sales was also more than entirely due to higher spending by customers from other countries
8710719 sales to new yorkers were below last year which should not be too surprising to anyone
8710720 even though the u s was weaker than expected i think a lot of investors thought that could happen

8710729 they walked out contrary to the rules because they dont want to accept defeat they know that they will be defeated
8710730 they walked out because they dont want it to appear like a failure for its leader who has said that he will be able to win over barisan nasional mps

8710743 sim eu acho que bush ser visto como autor de uma das piores pol ticas externas dos estados unidos certamente o pior dos s culos 20 e 21 disse folha joseph nye professor de rela es internacionais de harvard
8710744 h algumas reas em que foi melhor que outras como sua pol tica em rela o aids na frica mas em geral e especificamente no oriente m dio foi muito muito mal
8710745 bush disse que liderar quer dizer decidir e eu acho que se voc decide mas erra no caminho voc vira um
8710746 voc tem de saber em que condi es decidir quando decidir e com quem voc decide e bush nunca foi muito bom nisso
8710747 assim como aconteceu com a cor ia depois vista como uma guerra necess ria que conteve o avan o da china e truman que deixou a casa branca com ndices recordes de impopularidade para depois ver estudiosos reavaliarem sua atua o no campo externo o mesmo deve ocorrer com bush e sua conten o do islamofascismo nos pr ximos anos

8710774 the excellence of knowledge is due only to the fact that it causes a person to fear and obey allaah otherwise it is just like anything else
8710775 whoever learns something in the name of allaah seeking that which is with him he will win and whoever learns something for other than allaah he will not reach the goal nor will his acquired knowledge bring him closer to allaah
8710776 true knowledge is not measured in relationship to how much you memorize and then narrate but rather true knowledge is an expression of piety protecting oneself from what allaah prohibited and acting upon what he mandated
8710777 oh uwaymir what have you done with what you have learned
8710778 there is no good for you to know what you do not know while you are not acting upon what you do know because the likeness of that is as the likeness of a man who gathers firewood so he ties up a bundle and tries to carry it but he is not able to so he adds another one to it
8710779 oh my son have you acted yet upon what you have heard from me
8710780 oh my son then why do you seek increase in allahs proof against us and against you
8710781 o allahs messenger who will be the luckiest person who will gain your intercession on the day of resurrection
8710782 i have thought that none will ask me about it before you as i know your longing for the learning of hadiths
8710783 look for the knowledge of hadith and get it written as i am afraid that religious knowledge will vanish and the religious learned men will pass away die do not accept anything save the hadiths of the prophet circulate knowledge and teach the ignorant for knowledge does not vanish except when it is kept secretly to oneself
8710784 his banner over me was love song 2 4 the banner is an emblem of safety and protection a sign of the presence of a host persons belonging to an army do encamp under their banner in security so did the children of israel in the wilderness every tribe kept their camps under their own standard it is also a token of success and victory ps 20 5 christ has a banner for his saints and that is love all their protection is from his love and they shall have the protection his love can give them this safeguards them from hell death all their enemies whatever presses on them it must pass through the banner of the love of the lord jesus they have then great spiritual safety which is another ornament or excellency of their communion with him
8710785 das ist eine gruppe die keiner untersch tzen sollte lyon bukarest und florenz sind schwer zu spielen gro e klubs in ihren l ndern ein schmankerl f r luca toni und viele fu ballfans in deutschland und italien ist nat rlich das duell mit dem ac florenz ich freue mich auf alle diese spiele und bin zuversichtlich da wir unser ziel weiterzukommen schaffen werden
8710786 leichte gruppen gibt es in der champions league sowieso nicht florenz hat seinen reiz durch luca toni lyon ist ein brocken und steaua bukarest hat eine sehr spielstarke mannschaft diese gruppe hat es in sich es wird eine sehr sehr spannende angelegenheit aber wir freuen uns auf die spiele in der champions legaue
8710787 ich h tte lieber gegen eine andere gro e mannschaft wie chelsea manchester oder arsenal gespielt aber nicht gegen lyon denn aus eigener erfahrung wei ich nur zu gut dass das eine sehr gute mannschaft ist die schwer zu schlagen ist
8710788 ich denke das ist eine machbare gruppe auch wenn wir die gegner nat rlich nicht untersch tzen d rfen vor allem den ac florenz stufe ich als gro en konkurrenten im kampf um den ersten gruppenplatz ein
8710789 es h tte schlimmer kommen k nnen dennoch m ssen wir aufpassen in lyon habe ich mit bremen schon mal 2 7 verloren also alles andere als gute erinnerungen florenz hat mit mutu und gilardino einen ganz starken angriff und bukarest ist die unbekannte mannschaft in dieser gruppe aber gerade deswegen nicht zu untersch tzen

8710887 we have 17 million households that we insure throughout the country and we need to make ensure we are not overexposed in any one area that is catastrophe prone
8710888 insurers have to assume that a worst case scenario can occur any year
8710889 while 2005 was by far the worse year ever for insured catastrophe losses in the u s future storms could prove even costlier reaching upward of 100 billion

8710909 companion security was headed by a former chicago policeman with a troubled history daniel t

8710959 the choice of contributors was deliberate because were hoping to keep the service as low cost as possible so it will remain sustainable

8711034 id love to go back and see some pac 10 games this year but with the schedule we have it looks almost impossible we did get to go see two sec games last season and plan on hitting a couple again this year i really dont know what im going to tell them right now but well give it our best shot at getting them all motivated and well have a lot of fun with the opportunity to get back down there
8711035 it was a lot of fun and a great experience to get back down to my old school

8711048 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8711049 still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signaling at dawn and dusk
8711050 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8711051 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night
8711052 if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbor or an anole doesnt see its neighbor it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8711053 as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive

8711057 this is the laboratory right here its not big but its comprehensive in fact tracy is doing some blood test right now
8711058 often times well unscrew the cap for them right here and give them their first dose before they walk out of the door
8711059 wed like to make it so that theres no wait at all thats really our goal is that the person comes in and the longest they have to wait is a few minutes
8711060 i think that we can probably take care of 80 85 percent of the things that people would associate going to the emergency room
8711061 i live just around the corner so if something comes up in the middle of the night i know where i can get to
8711062 do you think its a valid argument that a john mccain administration would be a four year extension of the bush administration
8711063 sure but i think thats whats going to happen with obama too
8711064 they want more troops in afghanistan they want to send more support to georgia to protect the oil line there neither one says bring home the troops from iraq from the bases you know the bases are going to stay there the embassy as big as the vatican thats going to remain so their foreign policies are exactly the same theyre both very very aggressive with iran so i would say theres no difference
8711065 how would you handle these global threats then if its not to send our troops there and make sure that were protected
8711066 why are we on the borders of russia provoking the russians i mean the georgians initiated the military attack against these enclaves where there were mostly russians its the fact that were over there that we create these crises
8711067 isnt it part of our duty though to support these fledgling democracies that ask for our help
8711068 we should endorse the principle but not send troops and money once we get over there we just aggravate the situation
8711069 we clenis bombed serbia in order for kosovo to become independent
8711070 now the russians are doing the same thing its this total inconsistency
8711071 it looked like darkness and it reeked of joblessness and it was standing right in front of us howling and gnashing its teeth and leaving a giant dustbowl in its wake
8711072 as most experts know our economy is in a recession
8711073 despu s de tantas incoherencias y habladurias de m s por parte de la scene no voy a decir nada sobre lo que nos deparar uno de los torneos mas importantes a nivel europeo solamente espero poder entrenar y en funci n de eso que la gente opine deseo mucha suerte a todos los clanes espa oles participantes y por ltimo a adir que me parece indignante que dragon vaya a tener la posibilidad de jugar este torneo cuando no tiene ningun derecho a ello

8711077 i would love to get revenge for all mexicans whove fought against manny if you ask me that would be my choice because hes considered pound for pound champion of the world and we can meet half ways and make a big fight out of it
8711078 manny holds that mythical title now so all right prove it hes exciting hes strong hes fast i believe the odds came out at two to one so why not
8711079 its a huge opportunity for pacquiao and not only monetarily wise but exposure because the whole world will be watching this fight
8711080 the truth is in the numbers oscar should be getting the lions share the most mannys ever made is four times less than what oscars made in his last five fights average so you really cant compare apples and oranges and manny has to understand that
8711081 freddie roach is already talking that i cant pull the trigger well if this fight happens you watch ill pull the trigger
8711082 it was something that hurt him because he left freddie on good terms after freddie helped him for the fight with mayweather and to be coming from a guy like freddie who he considers a friend it was hurtful
8711083 i can make 147 pounds with no problem i went up six weight classes so its not impossible roy jones went up to heavyweight and he won the title so in the history of boxing its been proven that the smaller guy jumps up three four or five weight classes and can be successful so this wouldnt be the first
8711084 the fact is that in an average fight manny pacquiao makes two and a half three or three and a half million dollars if he goes in against say juan manuel marquez or erik morales maybe he makes four and a half or five million dollars ok so now if he goes and fights oscar hes guaranteed ten million dollars and can potentially make fifteen sixteen or more depending on how the pay per view numbers are under that seventy thirty deal its a little bit difficult to understand why somebody would turn that down
8711085 it certainly isnt because of money because he makes three or four times more so i dont know maybe hes scared fighting oscar there must be a reason why he hasnt said yes
8711086 feasibility of cooling the earth with a cloud of small spacecraft near l1
8711087 the earlier ideas were for bigger heavier structures that would have needed manufacture and launch from the moon which is pretty futuristic
8711088 i wanted to make the sunshade from small flyers small light and extremely thin spacecraft that could be completely assembled and launched from earth in stacks of a million at a time when they reached l1 they would be dealt off the stack into a cloud theres nothing to assemble in space
8711089 it seems feasible that it could be developed and deployed in about 25 years at a cost of a few trillion dollars with care the solar shade should last about 50 years so the average cost is about 100 billion a year or about two tenths of one percent of the global domestic product
8711090 the sunshade is no substitute for developing renewable energy the only permanent solution a similar massive level of technological innovation and financial investment could ensure that
8711091 but if the planet gets into an abrupt climate crisis that can only be fixed by cooling it would be good to be ready with some shading solutions that have been worked out
8711092 diese gruppe hat es in sich lyon ist ein brocken florenz hat seinen reiz durch luca toni es wird eine sehr sehr spannende angelegenheit aber wir freuen uns sehr auf die spiele in der champions league
8711093 diese auslosung hat einen gro en reiz wir m ssen diese gruppe sehr engagiert angehen und d rfen sie auf keine fall untersch tzen famagusta k nnnen wir nicht einsch tzen sie haben aber viel geleistet um hier mitspielen zu k nnen sie waren gegen rapid wien und olympiakos pir us krasse au enseiter

8711114 planned parenthood is the largest single provider of abortion and family suppression services in the united states
8711115 this facility in this minority neighborhood should offend every african american and latino family and all of us because every child lost to abortion here subtracts one more life one more universe of possibilities and talent from the future of this community the business of planned parenthood is the prevention of the future and business is good and very profitable at the expense of this community
8711116 i want my five children to live in a world where the weak are protected from the strong i want them to live in a world where all life is protected
8711117 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8711118 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8711119 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8711120 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8711121 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8711122 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8711123 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8711124 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8711125 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8711126 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8711137 hemos visto los pasajeros venezolanos gente que cuida su tren y defiende lo que est usando lo cual habla de un pueblo civilizado al que le han puesto un sistema de transporte bueno y por ello lo cuida
8711138 es algo realmente muy impresionante para nosotros ya que venimos de hablar de lo que nos gustar a hacer para enlazar a venezuela con argentina a trav s del tren del sur y resulta que ac estamos viendo lo que se ha hecho en estos a os y no es m s que el mejor ejemplo de lo que puede llegar hacerse en el futuro entre ambas naciones

8711165 surge la sospecha de que alguien en estados unidos ha provocado intencionadamente este conflicto para agravar la situaci n y dar preferencia en la lucha competitiva a uno de los candidatos por el puesto de presidente de eeuu
8711166 surge la sospecha que alguien en estados unidos cre este conflicto especialmente con el objetivo de hacer la situaci n m s tensa y crear una ventaja competitiva para uno de los candidatos que se est n disputando la presidencia de eeuu

8711168 hemos tenido un incremento en el producto interno bruto pib de 7 1 por ciento lo que nos da un promedio para el primer semestre de un 6 por ciento y seg n todas las proyecciones este se va a mantener por encima de ese porcentaje
8711169 la econom a ha venido creciendo por encima del promedio que hemos venido planteando
8711170 esto refleja los altos ndices de especulaci n y a pesar de la importante reuni n que se realiz entre productores y consumidores en arabia saudita recientemente las grandes potencias industrializadas se negaron a aceptar la introducci n de mecanismos de regulaci n para atenuar los altos niveles de especulaci n estados unidos recientemente se vio forzado a hacerlo lo que en cierto modo explica el nivel estacionario en que se encuentran estos mercados
8711171 el sector de los alimentos en el mundo est experimentando una agud sima crisis no solo en lo relativo en la producci n excesivamente monopolizada sino tambi n en el consumo
8711172 es una terrible ley que se presenta en la uni n europea para perseguir interpelar y execrar a los inmigrantes de frica y latinoam rica que han ido a europa por razones socioecon micas buscando un sue o que quiz s alguien les vendi en alg n momento de su vida haci ndole creer que lejos de su tierra estar an mejor
8711173 objetos corotos que deben tener una utilidad y en el momento que esa utilidad deja de ser productiva simplemente somos desechados como lo que somos para ellos simples corotos
8711174 que resulta parad jico que en europa surja este tipo de normativa justamente uno de los continente que m s emigrantes ha tenido en la historia despu s de la segunda guerra mundial muchos europeos cayeron en la mendicidad muchos peleaban por una hogaza de pan e incluso las familias se ve an obligadas a vender sus hijas para prostituirlas

8711184 tom clearly is one of the best writers and teachers of writing in the world today
8711185 he wrote a seminal piece of journalism called a cry in the night that dominated our craft for a long time and made a model for the rest of us to follow
8711186 hes been my teacher since the day i met him iu will soon get a glimpse of his passion and ferocious belief that journalism should be fair and truthful but also raucous subversive emotional and daring
8711187 was in the small group of writers who led the renaissance in newspaper narratives in the 80s and 90s and he is known around the world for his evangelism on the subject which is why iu came calling
8711188 tom has so many strengths one is that he knows how to do journalism he has a body of work that students can study and learn from which i think is the best way for a student to learn second he knows how to explain journalism ive heard him teach many times and every time ive walked away excited by the possibilities of what we do
8711189 in his teaching french is skilled at striking a balance between using his stories and not making all his teaching about war stories
8711190 think back to the 2004 convention when the democrats nominated their weakest candidate in a half century
8711191 who delivered an electrifying address that catapulted him onto the national stage an unknown illinois politician with thin credentials and a far left background named barack obama thats who is there any reason to think that 2012 wont see history repeat itself
8711192 donna reed meets cinderella meets mr smith goes to washington
8711193 four more years of seasoning and accomplishments will definitely put her on the short list for 2012 after all a dream deferred is still a dream right
8711194 to come this far and almost grab the brass ring really shows you how far this countrys advanced
8711195 theres no shame to losing out to two political heavyweights like barack obama and joe biden thats for sure she can be proud of what she did
8711196 thats it fucker im gonna come up there and kick your ass
8711197 theres no way you could make it all the way up ten flights of stairs
8711198 bastard youre gonna be shitting shoe leather for a week

8711215 a problem can crop up in just one instant and you dont realize its there until its too late
8711216 those international standards can be sometimes more stringent than provincial or territorial requirements
8711217 our results show that obstetricians can use magnesium sulphate which they have experience prescribing to reduce the risk of a devastating condition cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8711218 it basically comes down to how frequently theyre having symptoms and how much the symptoms are affecting their life
8711219 avoiding caffeine eliminating fatty or acidic foods losing excess weight and quitting smoking are all things patients can do to control their acid reflux
8711220 if people are having symptoms on a daily basis or more than three times a week we usually recommend they start medication
8711221 most patients suffering from mild acid reflux will treat themselves with over the counter medications
8711222 antacids are better for immediate relief like after a big meal because their effectiveness is short lived in nature and only lasts for as long as its in the system
8711223 you should see a doctor if your symptoms are not controlled by over the counter medicines because it could be a sign of a more serious condition
8711224 carafate is a liquid suspension that essentially coats the inside of the esophagus its short lived in its effectiveness because once the coating wears off its not going to do much
8711225 we really only prescribe it for people who have symptoms less than a couple times a week or month
8711226 h 2 receptor blockers work by shutting off the production of acid in the stomach
8711227 they are effective for mild reflux theyre relatively inexpensive and can be used casually by people who only have symptoms a couple times a month
8711228 the standard of care for treating gerd and related digestive diseases has become proton pump inhibitors and because they are so safe these are the most common medicines

8711291 i think this is a wonderful thing for pittsburgh to be recognized officially as the launch of the exhibition
8711292 people in pittsburgh are understanding that now and before very few people thought about it the name of pittsburgh as the original gateway to the west it really is true
8711293 the activities deemed too provocative by adams township have become an increasingly popular form of exercise for women around the country and even in china a country not known for freedom
8711294 my classes are a specially designed exercise for women that allows them to have fun feel confident about their bodies and express their sexuality
8711295 this is not a strip joint or gentlemans club this is a dance and fitness studio just like hundreds of others that have recently opened around the country including here in the pittsburgh area
8711296 we obviously believe that this is the precise wrong direction for pennsylvanias future
8711297 we have made pennsylvania dependent upon the turnpike commission for the major funding of our roads highways bridges and mass transit
8711298 and we have placed our trust our faith and a tremendous amount of debt on what is clearly one of the most corrupt scandalous abusive can i come up with any more adjectives patronage laden agency that exists
8711299 it is unfortunate when those who cannot prevail on the public policy debate resort to such negative attacks
8711300 the state senator who has been called the patron saint of the turnpike commission the capitols original godfather

8711313 i had to fire this person because he wasnt getting his work done but i was dragging out the firing because i was trying to think of a tactful way to do it so that the person didnt lash out
8711314 so i tried to get my wife to play the bad guy but she said no thats your company
8711315 i didnt rise to her level and what the person eventually did was break down cry and come back into my office to apologize
8711316 so i told the employee that i wasnt going to fire her but instead allow her to resign and was going to give her a letter to take to a potential employer
8711317 but its also difficult because if you have developed some type of relationship with that person or if you are aware of something going on in the employees personal life that is going to be impacted by the firing you dont want to be the bearer of bad news

8711322 just as we benefit when the communities surrounding the campus prosper so too the communities in which we are embedded will thrive when the university succeeds
8711323 we are looking forward to experiencing a real new england autumn with its many distinctive colors and hues i am perhaps less effusive about the snow thing which i realize follows the foliage thing but i intend to keep an open mind becoming a member of a new community means truly embracing it including the frozen parts

8711337 after 30 plus years devoting myself to my art and craft i needed to make a musical statement that someday i could look back on and realize at that moment of time i did exactly what i wanted to do ive never written songs like this i was on this inspirational roll there was an urgency to it i realized that i had no more time in my life for rehearsals and i took that energy into the studio
8711338 the guy had the keys to every studio in town
8711339 i wanted players who knew how to frame a song
8711340 who knew how to take a lyric and enhance it
8711341 when i went to the city we got a chance to hang out in those neighborhoods destroyed by the hurricane
8711342 i was shocked and embarrassed by the fact that two years later a major american city could be left in that state of chaos that really affected me people losing their city but not losing their heart
8711343 i did everything on blind faith and gut feeling but it worked like a charm
8711344 the project began to take on this incredible momentum there was a creative energy that carried the project through every musician dedicated themselves to these songs it was the most effortless joyful inspirational playing ive experienced since recording abandoned luncheonette there was a special chemistry a special moment in time
8711345 when we do come back together we bring those experiences to what we do which makes it even better but this is a very personal record for me and without a doubt the highlight of my recording career
8711346 upon taking the helm as president of thomas more college two years ago i laid plans to establish a publishing program that further advances the colleges mission of evangelizing the culture by promoting the catholic intellectual tradition i have always admired the work of sophia institute press and had hoped to establish a press that mirrored sophias substantial work
8711347 all of us at thomas more college are excited to have the opportunity to form a relationship with sophia that reduces repetition and enables thomas more college and the institute to more fully realize their missions of serving both the church and society
8711348 we at sophia institute press are excited to be closely associated with an orthodox catholic college like thomas more i am delighted that sophias 25 year tradition of publishing great catholic spiritual works will continue well into the future as the publishing imprint of thomas more college i have full confidence in jeff nelsons leadership and look forward to working closely with him for years to come

8711365 he looks to be in great shape he looks ready to go
8711366 theres no reason to believe he wont be 100 percent for training camp
8711367 i wanted to see him run unencumbered go through agility drills jumping drills the things players do you hope they dont limp or favor a leg he did not that was number one
8711368 on top of that i was impressed by what he did with his body to get in shape and get stronger it was obvious to me he had been in the weight room
8711369 he hasnt been in a game since january so obviously training camp will be very important
8711370 you can go out and do drills shoot lift weights and all that but none of that will equate to nba basketball its important for him to have a productive and hopefully injury free training camp

8711398 at 15 saying i wanted to do a reggae album after growing up in a snazzy house in houston it was kind of random
8711399 i think i decided is an important record a grammy record and as a live performer shes spectacular you cant hate on it

8711404 i attempted to get up to use the restroom rather urgently during the 7th inning stretch as god bless america was beginning
8711405 as soon as the latter came out of my mouth my right arm was twisted violently behind my back and i was informed that i was being escorted out of the stadium
8711406 i was sitting in the tier level and of course this is the highest level of the stadium and i was escorted in this painful manner down the entire length of the stadium
8711407 when we reached the exit of the stadium they confiscated my ticket and the first officer shoved me through the turnstiles saying get the hell out of my country if you dont like it
8711408 nowhere on the yankee stadium ticket policy nor on any posted sign does it say that forced patriotism is a required element to attend a baseball game nowhere in the laws of this country would that begin to be defensible
8711409 furthermore when the two officers returned to their section steve who was still in the stadium overhead one of the officers say we got to watch ourselves
8711410 i do not believe in god nor am in support of this country to a degree of patriotic fanaticism the fact that i wanted to use the restroom instead of standing through god bless america should not be grounds for a forcible ejection from a baseball game

8711423 tomatoes are again safe to eat the food and drug administration said thursday weeks after the food was blamed as a source of a salmonella outbreak in the united states and canada the federal agency lifted its warning about tomatoes but left in place a warning about raw jalape o and serrano peppers having previously said those foods also may be linked to the outbreak

8711425 the movie season concludes this weekend and domestic ticket sales so far total 3 9 billion up a little more than 1 from last years record summer according to media by numbers year to date revenues stand at 6 7 billion down slightly from 2007 but up from the three earlier years the tracking firm says higher ticket prices mean theaters are selling fewer total admissions but few distributors and exhibitors are complaining except for those handling what has become hollywoods trickiest sell the art film while the summer was filled with far more hits than catastrophes there were a handful of star vehicles that hardly drew a breath swing vote

8711430 internet advertising is continuing to drive spending ahead of other sectors in nearly every region internet is set to overtake radio this year to become the worlds third most popular medium behind tv and print
8711431 but changes in consumer behaviour arent the only reason for this with search now central to the planning and execution of any campaign online media brings a greater level of accountability not just to itself but to tv print and other forms of advertising this is why we are predicting further strong growth for internet even when advertisers are cautious in many of the other sectors
8711432 its clear that the worldwide economic issues affecting businesses are having an impact on where and how advertisers spend their money it is also significant that the us and the uk as the highest spenders on advertising in their regions are showing reductions in our forecasts but overall the picture is still one of growth

8711438 we dont want to submit to god so we say that he can not be known or does not exist
8711439 neither the word trinity nor the explicit doctrine as such appears in the new testament nor did jesus and his followers intend to contradict the shema in the old testament hear o israel the lord our god is one lord deut
8711440 in scripture there is as yet no single term by which the three divine persons are denoted together the word trias of which the latin trinitas is a translation is first found in theophilus of antioch about a d 180 shortly afterwards it appears in its latin form of trinitas in tertullian
8711441 the formulation one god in three persons was not solidly established certainly not fully assimilated into christian life and its profession of faith prior to the end of the 4th century
8711442 christianity derived from judaism and judaism was strictly unitarian believing that god is one person
8711443 the platonic trinity itself merely a rearrangement of older trinities dating back to earlier peoples appears to be the rational philosophic trinity of attributes that gave birth to the three hypostases or divine persons taught by the christian churches
8711444 the trinity of persons within the unity of nature is defined in terms of person and nature which are g ree k philosophical terms actually the terms do not appear in the bible
8711445 because the trinity is such an important part of later christian doctrine it is striking that the term does not appear in the new testament likewise the developed concept of three coequal partnersin the godhead found in later creedal formulations cannot be clearly detected within the confines of the bible canon it is important to avoid reading the trinity into places where it does not appear
8711446 the trinity the nt does not contain the developed doctrine of the trinity the bible lacks the express declaration that the father the son and the holy spirit are of equal essence and therefore in an equal sense god himself and the other express declarations is also lacking that god is god thus and only thus i e as the father the son and the holy spirit these two express declarations which go beyond the witness of the bible are the twofold content of lthe church doctrine of the trinity karl barth cd i 1 437 it also lacks such terms as trinity lat trinitas which was coined by tertullian against praxeas 3 11 12 etc and homoousias which feature in the creed of nicea 325 to denote christ was the same substance as the father
8711447 the word trinity is not found in the bible it did not find a place formally in the theology of the church till the 4th century
8711448 theologians today are in agreement that the hebrew bible does not contain a doctrine of the trinity
8711449 the doctrine of the holy trinity is not taught in the o ld t estament
8711450 theologians agree that the new testament also does not contain an explicit doctrine of the trinity
8711451 the new testament writers give us no formal or formulated doctrine of the trinity no explicit teaching that in one god there are three co equal divine persons nowhere do we find any trinitarian doctrine of three distinct subjects of divine life and activity in the same godhead
8711452 neither the word trinity nor the explicit doctrine appears in the new testament
8711453 as far as the new testament is concerned one does not find in it an actual doctrine of the trinity
8711454 the n ew t estament does not contain the developed doctrine of the trinity the bible lacks the express declaration that the father the son and the holy spirit are of equal essence said protestant theologian karl barth
8711455 to jesus and paul the doctrine of the trinity was apparently unknown
8711456 jesus christ never mentioned such a phenomenon and nowhere in the new testament does the word trinity appear
8711457 primitive christianity did not have an explicit doctrine of the trinity such as was subsequently elaborated in the creeds
8711458 the early christians however did not at first think of applying the trinity idea to their own faith
8711459 the formulation one god in three persons was not solidly established certainly not fully assimilated into christian life and its profession of faith prior to the end of the 4th century among the apostolic fathers there had been nothing even remotely approaching such a mentality or perspective
8711460 the significance of the angel christology for the post apostolic period from the point of view of doctrinal history lies in the fact that it stood in the way of lthe developement of a homoousian doctrine of the trinity in the later rthodox nicene sense owing to its fundamentally subordinationist character
8711461 every significant theologian of the church in the pre nicene period had actually represented asubordinationist christology 234

8711788 youre lucky i didnt knock the f k out of you
8711789 a lot of people say well what do you actors need why are you speaking up youre not people who need anything and its true were very blessed but almost all of us come from real middle class families and because we have the platform that we do it makes it a little bit easier for us to speak up speak out but everyone should really be doing it mostly im just here because im a bleeding heart liberal and a concerned citizen and i cant wait to hear the speeches every election is historic but this one is particularly so and so im so excited to be here
8711790 i dont feel very good about the last eight years and i feel like were in a place where we really need theres a lot of damage that we need to recover from and we need a very strong and inspirational leader to bring us out of this its pretty grim
8711791 i did support hillary rodham clinton in the new york primary because ive been an admirer of hillarys for a long time shes been an excellent senator and of course i was slightly biased by the fact that she was a woman i never thought that in my lifetime i would have the pleasure of voting for a woman for president so i did vote for her in the primary but i always admired barack obama and when it became time for hillary to step aside and for obama to become the nominee i was very pleased to be able to support him and i prayed that he would pick joe biden for his vice president i thought that was the best possible choice
8711792 one of the benefits and pleasures of being an actor is having the opportunity to travel around the united states to travel overseas i began traveling to europe and asia when i was about 20 and the respect that our country had the regard that our country had throughout the world was so tremendous the embrace that youd receive just for being an american was extraordinary and over the last eight years during my travels ive seen that love for our country become so compromised that i dont know how well ever regain our stature in the world
8711793 i have to be very sincere the person that makes me feel very happy also because she chose vintage was julia roberts in erin brockovich when she got the academy award

8711848 giant season ticket holders in the upper deck are guaranteed of keeping their seats as long as they pay a 1000 psl seniority of holding tickets is not a factor in their psl plan however the jets are basing seniority of their psl plan therefore existing season ticket holders in the upper deck are at risk of being displaced by ticket holders sitting downstairs who possess more seniority and wish to move to the upper deck in order to avoid paying no psl at all so the end result would be that current upper deck season ticket holders lacking seniority could actually be forced to pay for an expensive psl that is tied to lower or mid level seats or their seat location in the upper deck could be significantly downgraded for the first row in the upper deck to the last row
8711849 someone asked me the other day what i thought about the idea of making olympic gold medal sprinter usain bolt a football player
8711850 for all the optimism surrounding the defending super bowl champion giants and there is plenty of reason to think this will be a very very good team this year the one thing they cant control is the one thing that could make a mess out of this season the giants have already gotten a taste of it not even a month into training camp if youre even remotely familiar with whats been happening with the team you know what it is injuries
8711851 i already heard the news and ive been asked the question but no comment is my answer
8711852 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8711853 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8711854 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8711855 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8711856 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8711857 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8711858 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8711859 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8711860 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways

8711895 of course we realize that people need some entertainment but they can go to the parks and see the flowers and from this they will learn about islam

8711897 it is a chance for me to get some games and i think that is something i definitely have to do at this stage of my career
8711898 with the new players who have come to rangers my chances will probably be a bit more limited and this is the best option for me to pursue just now

8711915 jeg ser det som noget vi mennesker ikke har kontrol over barack obama er udvalgt til at gennemf re en mission ligesom martin luther king var det
8711916 under ingen omst ndigheder han m tte jo v re vanvittig det hvide amerika ville sige hvor vover en sort mand at stille op til pr sidentposten jeg troede ikke p det m ske om 25 30 r
8711917 i det sidste halvandet r har jeg levet p en sky det er sv rt at beskrive hvordan jeg vil reagere n r jeg st r der inde og ser ham tale foran mig en h jere magt har udpeget ham til denne rolle
8711918 der var mange gange i kings liv hvor han frygtede for sit liv og var t t p at fortryde hvad han havde sat i gang men han kunne ikke vende om han var den udvalgte og havde ikke l ngere kontrol det samme er sket med obama
8711919 obama har baseret sin valgkamp p de principper som martin fulgte nemlig et menneske skal ikke bed mmes p hans hudfarve men p hans personlige karakter og ligesom king og gandhi har obama identificeret sin person med sin mission obamas personlige livshistorie repr senterer den forandring og det h b som er kampagnens politiske budskab
8711920 det handler om at ndre den politiske kultur i washington ja i hele landet det er den dybereliggende forandring som obama sigter mod derfor n gter han at f re en negativ kampagne han ved at man ikke kan opn noget hvis man selv n gter at v re det ingen anden pr sidentkandidat i moderne tid har v ret s principfast som ham
8711921 jeg tror han ville have v ret overrasket over at det tog 40 r bobby kennedy forudsagde i 1968 pr cist 40 r martin vidste at vi kun ville se fremskridt hvis nogen var villig til at stikke hovedet frem og b re byrden og at han n ppe ville leve l nge nok til at se en sort pr sident han ville have sagt at obama er n et s langt fordi han st r p skuldrene af alle dem som kom f r ham
8711922 han hadede at v re slave og br ndte efter at blive en fri mand han pr vede at drukne sig selv to gange og blev hver gang reddet af sin mor til sidst flygtede min oldefar fra plantagen og blev efter flere forg ves fors g optaget af fl den senere k mpede han p nordstaternes side i borgerkrigen
8711923 vi frygter dagligt for hans liv vi ved at nogle hvide gerne ser ham d d for hvor vover en sort mand det er kun et sp rgsm l om tid inden de g r fors get
8711924 selv i slutningen af 1940erne var fortidens traditioner ikke forsvundet flere hvide familier i byen havde stadig b rn og b rneb rn af slaver boende p plantagen de kunne selvf lgelig rejse men de gamle b nd bestod
8711925 vi sorte skulle sidde bagest i bussen og g hen til en s rlig luge i restauranter viet til sorte for at hente maden
8711926 det er sv rt for mig at fatte hvor langt vi er kommet siden jeg voksede op det bl ser mig helt omkuld at v re med og se denne mand der repr senterer alle racer i usa og i verden blive k ret
8711927 selvf lgelig er nogle v lgere s fordomsfulde at de ikke vil stemme p ham men de fleste br nder efter forandring og normalt beder de ikke det parti som har skabt alle problemerne om at l se dem
8711928 christie has some problems with drinking and arnelle got mad
8711929 o j said dont talk to her like that and arnelle pushed him
8711930 she wasnt one to go swimming on the beach she hated the sand she wouldnt even put a toe in the swimming pool
8711931 our interest is in the continuity of record keeping and that when you generate a document during an investigation its public information
8711932 you dont take it with you and you dont claim that you did it on your own time
8711933 i still carry the marks on my body of what those german supermen did to me then i was sentenced to death
8711934 managed to foil the plan after they bribed a polish speaking german officer with a large backpack full of dollars on the drive to her execution site the officer knocked her unconscious he stopped the car and left her bleeding on the roadside the following day unaware the execution had not taken place the german authorities put up posters all over the city announcing she had been shot
8711935 et stort engagement jeg viger uden om repr sentation og pr senterer kun det bne sind og en million udstillinger kunst er lidt ligesom opera du skal have set 10 000 v rker f r du virkelig kan bne dit sind det kommer jeg med
8711936 jeg er meget fascineret af dette bjerg af visdom hvis jeg havde problemer p hjemmefronten ville jeg ikke v re s interesseret men det k rer i olie s jeg har tid til at fordybe mig i den slags fnidder
8711937 jeg tager det meget seri st jeg vil v re ekstra p passelig og forsigtig for jeg ved at det er nogle s rbare typer jeg har med at g re men jeg h ber at min begejstring vil smitte af p mine skriverier
8711938 det skal jeg lige v nne mig til men jeg f r n ppe jer overtalt til at flytte kunstd kningen om bagp
8711939 meget jeg kigger meget p min kunst f lger med p nettet hver dag tager til udstillinger og til kunstmesser i udlandet fem seks gange om ret men jeg vil ikke definere mig som kunstsamler
8711940 5 600 gode v rker jeg har ryddet op for nogle r siden og de d rlige er blevet solgt
8711941 der er en mexikansk bro af chris burden den ser jeg meget op til den er s dan lidt naiv poetisk og det passer godt ind i mit liv som er meget funktionelt og s har jeg et stort fotografi af en italiensk kvinde der hedder paula pivi hun har taget 20 forskellige albinodyr og placeret dem p en mark det f r jeg meget tid til at g med
8711942 mennesket kommer f r systemet vi er danmarks liberale parti venstre er det de facto ikke de har ikke leveret noget i syv r
8711943 og der bliver mindre og mindre frisind i danmark men vi st r for det modsatte
8711944 det kan godt v re at det f les l kkert at stikke fingrene i rerne og holde sig for jnene men det ndrer ikke ved at resten af verden bev ger sig derfor er der behov for reformer
8711945 s siger nogle uha det er ultraliberalt og s videre glistrup sagde nul procent vi siger 40 der er langt f r det bliver ultra
8711946 jeg er overbevist om at max 40 procent i skat to rs dagpengeperiode og en begr nset afgang til efterl n det nsker morgens lykketoft og marianne jelved dybt inde i deres hjerter men man t r ikke l ngere stilstandspartierne driver dansk politik sammen med frygten for at bliver angrebet for at v re asocial det forhindrer os i at bliver rigere
8711947 hvis jeg holder mig i god form og kan t le at spise tre plader chokolade hvorfor skal det s v re dyrere for mig fordi der er andre som ikke kan t le det vi kommer ikke til at stemme for yderligere rygeforbud og det er fair at se p om man allerede er g et for langt
8711948 og s har villy s vndal oven i k bet bestemt sig for at kopiere pia kj rsgaard han har lagt sig ned p stort set hele v rdipolitikken og indg et kompromiser med socialdemokraterne de har lavet det omvendte af fogh som fjernede alt hvad der var liberalt
8711949 for der kommer ikke et r dt flertal i danmark hvis vi ikke kommer ind kommer der vko flertal 100 pct sikkert
8711950 der er ikke andet end administrationslyst tilbage i regeringen der er ikke vilje til at l be en lille risiko eller til at sige det der er behov for
8711951 arbejdere i mit land jeg tror p chile og dets sk bne
8711952 dette er mine sidste ord og jeg er sikker p at mit offer ikke vil v re forg ves jeg er sikker p at det i det mindste vil kunne tjene som et moralsk l restykke der kan straffe forbrydelse kujoneri og forr deri
8711953 som venskaber og familier opl stes i strid om den rigtige vurdering af den spanske borgerkrig vil det g nu da der skal tages stilling til milit rets indgriben mod pr sident salvador allendes chilenske eksperiment
8711954 generalerne admiralerne og politiet samarbejdede med allende de indtr dte modvilligt i hans regering og de hjalp med at f samfundsmaskineriet til at fungere men regeringen var for udygtig dens st tter for fanatiske og sp ndingen i landet for stor til at de der havde f et ansvaret p allendes eget initiativ kunne undlade at gribe ind og chile har derfor f et en milit rregering medmindre man foretr kker at bruge et helt andet udtryk en overgangsregering med den opgave at hindre borgerkrig og at genskabe i det mindste konturerne af en arbejdende konomi
8711955 om borgerkrigen kan undg s vil vise sig at milit ret og politiet er uinteresseret i magten og vil give den fra sig hurtigst muligt er sikkert og chile vender ikke tilbage til tilstandene f r 1970 dertil st r de nye magthavere alt for delt ogs politisk og dertil er deres respekt for chiles love alt for stor det er ikke spanien om igen det er blot konstateringen af allende styrets fallit der ret l nge har v ret en kendsgerning formentlig ogs for allende selv
8711956 amerikas indflydelse synes at have v ret marginal om ikke mindre virkelig og det vil blive et led i historiens udforskning af f nomenet allende om hans marxistiske eksperiment fejlede p grund af indre svaghed eller ydre pres
8711957 usa vil f skylden for allendes fald og d d
8711958 forberedt p anklager og holder fingrene helt v k fra chile
8711959 chiles statskup var t t p at v re perfekt
8711960 begivenhederne i chile har f et format af tragedie ikke alene fordi pr sident salvador allende og mange andre har mistet livet s un dvendigt i denne magtkamp ogs fordi chiles solide demokratiske traditioner er blevet ofret for den tilsyneladende n dvendighed af et magtindgreb i en kaotisk udvikling
8711961 konomisk og politisk fremkaldte hans styre s kaotiske forhold i landet endda med midler der l ud over forfatningen at et indgreb fra milit r side var varslet og ventet det er tragisk at indgrebet da det kom endte som et overgreb
8711962 p sikker afstand og med det klarsyn som sikre afstande giver
8711963 men samtidig blev et andet sp rgsm l sat p spidsen om det liberale demokrati der i chile er us dvanligt liberalt skulle lade sig likvidere af et lille revolution rt mindretal som allende ikke kunne kontrollere eller om det liberale demokrati skulle forsvare sig dvs gribe ind b de mod den konomiske opl sning og navnlig den ellers uafvendelige og uigenkaldelige socialistiske revolution sp rgsm let der rummer det liberale demokratis afg rende dilemma som i weimar tyskland m tte i nogen tid henst ubesvaret og svaret var utilfredsstillende et milit rt kup selv om milit re kup er noget andet i chile end i gr kenland
8711964 og det er f ngslende at fundere over hvordan man selv ville forholde sig hvis alt det som i egentligste forstand g r tilv relsen v rd at leve p lignende m de var truet her i danmark eller i et andet nordisk land dette til forklaring p hvad der er sket i chile og m ske til skr k og advarsel
8711965 er det ubestrideligt at han og hans regering p tidspunktet for den brutale magtovertagelse var k rt politisk og konomisk fast
8711966 men for de yderligtg ende og revolution re kredse der var begyndt at tvivle p den levende allende som deres helt og forbillede er den d de allende helt anderledes nyttig fremfor alt i steuropa men ogs andre steder r res trommerne for allende p en m de der l gger et r gsl r over hans forfejlede politik og s ger at oppiske den revolution re gejst og l gge is r forretningsverdenen og amerika for had blev allendes politik derfor en skuffelse for de revolution re marxister som den blev det for mange andre t ver de ikke med at s ge at udnytte hans d d til at fremkalde had og harme og strejker i lande hvor strejker er tilladt forst r sig
8711967 en fremtr dende rolle i chiles politiske liv ogs p et senere tidspunkt
8711968 der garanterer de v bnede styrker gendarmeriet politiet og erhvervsgrupperne parlamentarisk repr sentation
8711969 med respektindgydende effektivitet og er nu i gang med at rette op p det konomiske og sociale kaos pr sident salvador allendes regering efterlod
8711970 juntaen l gger ikke skjul p at den vil v re h rd og beslutsom den har benbart ogs til hensigt at forlade scenen med rene h nder

8711972 it is a big blow to us and we could be without him kranjcar until around christmas or whatever
8711973 the frustrating thing is he didnt even do the injury playing for us he played nearly all the games last season and hes a player you cant replace really but we are going to try
8711974 jermain has picked up a bug and we just hope he will get over it in time
8711975 as for jerome hes never had a back problem before and we dont know why hes got one now maybe its because of a change of beds since he moved here
8711976 there are still a lot of ways we can play
8711977 although 4 4 2 is the way ive chose to go with these two up front there are going to be some games in which we go back to 4 5 1 which was so successful last season
8711978 ive still got a good squad even though it is not big enough especially with the uefa cup coming up
8711979 they will be very very pleased that they dont have to travel far
8711980 i think they will be delighted that theyve not got a lot of travelling to do
8711981 villarreal will not bring up any surprises for them aalborg is the team they will have to be careful of and they will come back to bite you if you disrespect them
8711982 against villarreal i know its a very tough game but people will be looking at the aalborg game and be thinking theres six points for you but i can guarantee that will not be the case for any of the teams facing aalborg
8711983 it will not be an easy six points to pick up so they will be very pleased they dont have to travel but it could have been a lot tougher but how can you say that when youre playing against manchester united and villarreal
8711984 well celtic have already beaten them and they were very unlucky in the first game as well when they played down in manchester the first time they met
8711985 it will be like a home game for them and they will have a big support and manchester united are everybodys favourite not just for the group but probably for the tournament again and rightly so
8711986 it was difficult for us but weve got through so it has been a positive day all round
8711987 we kept on knocking on the door they were in the box seat and could afford to get people behind the ball and play the counter attack
8711988 we always had to be mindful of that but in the end we got our rewards
8711989 after an hours play i thought we upped our energy levels and our play was more progressive
8711990 from that point onwards through extra time there was only one team that looked like they were going to nick it
8711991 we had a couple of chances michael johnson could very well have won it before the end of play
8711992 but well take the result it doesnt matter how we go through
8711993 its a bit of a lottery with penalties but were delighted weve overcome this hurdle
8711994 youre always relieved there are no easy games its a cliche but in europe there arent look at the events of last night with liverpool
8711995 the diaper opened and the baby fell to the ground but at a much slower speed
8711996 the diaper obviously lessened the impact of the fall and saved the babys life
8711997 he could also have been killed by one of the spikes
8711998 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8711999 fordi de kun ser de sager jeg f rer om l rdagen
8712000 this is an environment in which were likely to get a lot of head fakes both on the upside and the downside
8712001 this is just sort of data that trickles out that can be very positive one day and negative the next we dont yet think it signals a trend
8712002 the bottom line is that to build this water plant the taxpayers are getting soaked
8712003 the need to complete important projects like the water plant has not diminished
8712004 we cant sit back and let others worry about the future
8712005 i have never understood how putting a building underground is cheaper than putting a building aboveground
8712006 all other things being equal it may be more expensive to have the plant underground than at the surface level but it wasnt all other things being equal the length of tunneling that was required at the respective sites was a significant factor
8712007 det er st rkt bekymrende at s mange procent af for ldre til b rn i folkeskolen nsker den delte og ekskluderende skole tilbage og det er ekstra trist fordi de internationale pisa unders gelser faktisk beviser at det udelte skolesystem er det bedste
8712008 det vi skal g re op med er forestillingen om at holddannelse er lig med stempling og n r der er s stor for ldreopbakning som jeg opfatter det s synes jeg ogs man kan v re mindre bekymret ved det
8712009 b de elever l rere og for ldrene mener at der er for lidt disciplin i skolen og det er en vej at g
8712010 resultaterne tyder dermed ikke p at de h jtuddannede generelt er mere bekymrede
8712011 forskningen viser at det p virker de bogligt svage elevers indl ring negativt at v re sammen i homogene grupper dvs kun med andre der heller ikke klarer sig s godt hvis det resultat ogs g lder for holddeling i de centrale fag burde det derfor ikke v re i de svage elevers interesse at indf re holddeling til trods for det svarer kun 13 procent at de er uenige
8712012 vi ved fra tidligere unders gelser at hvis der var flere pladser p de private skoler s ville de blive fyldt op fordi mange st r p ventelister det bekymrende er at den store stigning i s gningen til de private og frie skoler har v ret kontinuerlig siden slutningen af 60erne til trods for mange fors g p at stoppe det
8712013 p mange skoler er der et for ldrepres for at f vanskelige b rn smidt ud af klasserne og vi ved fra en akf unders gelse fra sidste r at n r f eks andelen af tosprogede elever n r op over 30 procent s begynder de ressourcest rke familier b de blandt indvandrere og etnisk danskere at flytte deres b rn det er m ske forst eligt men ikke fremmende for solidariteten
8712014 vi ekskluderer i dag 3 8 procent af eleverne der bliver henvist til vidtg ende specialundervisning uden for normalklasserne og det er det h jeste antal siden 1950erne folkeskolen har faktisk aldrig v re mindre rummelig og det kan s skyldes at der er blevet flere vanskelige elever men det ved vi ikke rigtig noget om
8712015 hvis man f lger for ldrenes nsker betyder det mere opdeling efter fagligt indhold og det advarer vi imod men det er jo ogs et tegn p at der ikke er fulgt ressourcer med til at f re undervisningsdifferentieringen ud i livet der beh ver ikke at komme mere uro fordi der kommer flere sk ve elever hvis der tilf res ekstra ressourcer
8712016 men det m ikke blive statisk eller en dominerende del af undervisningen if lge unders gelse vil for ldrene g endnu l ngere end de muligheder man fik for get holddeling med en lov ndring i 2003 de vil have niveaudeling i centrale fag og det er en tilbagevenden til det vi kendte tidligere med udvidet og grundkursus eller endnu l ngere tilbage med boglig og almene linjer f r 1975
8712017 holddannelse betyder ikke at man stempler nogen som svage det betyder kun at man behandler eleverne forskelligt for at stille dem mere lige det skal ikke v re en permanent opdeling og eleverne skal kunne skifte fra det ene hold til det andet den gamle niveaudeling indebar en form for stempling og sortering men hvis man eksempelvis bliver bedre til at l se skal man skifte hold
8712018 i 30erne var det s dan at socialdemokraterne med julius bomholt som undervisningsminister gik ind for pr ver og karakterer fordi det var det der gav arbejderb rnene samme chance som andre det f rte til tydelige krav
8712019 man har allerede valgt en kurs der klart er p vej v k fra enhedsskolen men man h vder stadig at have den rummelige folkeskole hvor der er plads til alle det er blot efter parolen de dummeste bagerst og de kloge forrest det betyder f eks at man opdeler eleverne efter forskellige l ringsstile i stedet for faglige standpunkter man siger s at b gruppen skal have hj lp og st tte men grundtanken er at s m de jo n s meget de kan i stedet koncentrerer man sig om de mere sp ndende og dygtige elever derfor er der f eks stor interesse for talenter blandt skolepsykologer for tiden og skolepolitisk er stor fokus p at im dekomme for ldres forventninger og overbevise dem om at deres dygtige barn godt kan blive i folkeskolen
8712020 efter det m tte vi bare grine og ryge en sm g
8712021 det er et super cool sted men der er mange som er skr mte nu
8712022 de var fuldst ndigt sindssyge og en stod bare og slog helt vildt ud i blinde hver gang jeg begyndte at rejse mig
8712023 de r bte d b ssesvin og s slog den ene mig i hovedet med et br t med s m i
8712024 der har v ret mange overfald i parken p det seneste
8712025 mange t r ikke anmelde det for folk bliver skr mte og gider samtidig ikke forklare hvad de lavede i rstedsparken
8712026 en fik knust sine briller og s l b han bare det er jo ikke alle der bliver s ilde tilredt som mig og derfor gider folk m ske heller ikke anmelde det
8712027 i registrerede anmeldelser er det meget sm tal vi snakker om
8712028 jeg tror stadig der er homoseksuelle der ikke nsker at anmelde det
8712029 der er jo mange skabsb sser der ikke har lyst til at forklare politiet hvad de lavede i parken
8712030 det er sv rt at sige noget om hvor d kkende tallene er for vi ved i sagens natur ikke hvor stor en del af m lgruppen vi har fat i
8712031 62 homoseksuelle p kun halvanden m ned har v ret udsat for hate crimes
8712032 jeg vil gerne vide mere om problemets omfang og om hvad vi kan g re og om hvem det er som overfalder de homoseksuelle er det indvandrere som st r bag er det noget som vi skal have ind i vores integration
8712033 det er rkedanske hvide pensionister der fort ller hvordan de gik i parken som unge og fandt nogle nemme ofre at t ve
8712034 der har altid v ret overfald i parken men det er som om det popper op med mellemrum at nogle synes det er festligt at g ind i parken og sl l s
8712035 det mest skr mmende er n sten at de andre i parken bare l b v k hvis man havde v ret tre fire homoer kunne man m ske have skr mt dem v k eller i det mindste kunne nogle andre fra parken have ringet efter politiet
8712036 det er ligesom et tr fyldt med krager hvis der lyder et ordentligt brag s pisker de alle sammen forskr kkede ud n r folk h rer at nogen bliver overfaldet s l ber de bare ud af parken
8712037 jeg sagde bare han skulle g ned p kn og sutte min pik til det spr jtede
8712038 jeg t nkte m ske at det var noget underligt forkvaklet noget men alligevel var det ogs meget festligt
8712039 tit ser man en jogger der lige forsvinder ind i krattet og s kommer han ud 20 minutter senere og man t nker det var da en rimelig lang str k velse

8712043 det er kontormanden der lige f r sig et lille put p toilettet med en tr kkerdreng
8712044 de fleste er meget diskrete men nogle gange ser vi nogle turister der har h rt om danmark som et frit land og som godt kan finde p at blotte sig lidt for meget
8712045 vi skal servicere borgerne p bedst mulige vis og som gartnere er vi her for at bevare den her perle midt i byen

8712047 when a rainbow took over the heart of the city

8712049 selvf lgelig er der ikke den samme respekt for voksne som tidligere og selvf lgelig tr ffer man j vnligt fr kke unger men det skal man ikke tage for h jtideligt har vi disciplinkrise i den danske folkeskole med j vne mellemrum h res at det har man den stadigt stigende gruppe af l rere som s ger f rtidspension skulle give et fingerpeg om det i et samfund hvor etablerede normer er under hastig ndring m opfattelsen af skolen som samfundets skole ogs revideres
8712050 allerede i 1950erne begyndte man officielt at tale om at skolen ikke kan rumme de unge den sorterer ud og derfor f r man fra undervisningsministeriets side for f rste gang forestillingen om at skolen skal v re b rneparat og ikke omvendt
8712051 konservative aviser som f eks kristeligt dagblad skrev at nu skulle der strammes op p disciplinen i skolen og konklusionen der ogs g lder i dag er at vi hverken er enige om midlerne i opdragelsen eller hvordan b rn skal opf re sig
8712052 hvor man tidligere havde en ydre disciplin er vi blevet afh ngige af at der skal v re en indre disciplin disciplineringen skal igennem den enkeltes selvforhold hvis man skal f et barn til at opf re sig disciplineret er det barnets selvstyre man skal bruge til at styre barnet selv det er det der er det nye og roden til vores tids disciplinkrise h ndtaget til at ud ve disciplin er blevet et indre h ndtag
8712053 man er vendt tilbage til den gamle m de at udtrykke det p at krage s ge mage i mange r haft man haft det som det vigtigste p dagogiske princip at splitte disse magepar fordi man havde en forestilling om at alle er udskiftelige derfor har man ogs s rget for at gruppedannelser var underlagt l rerne men der jo ikke nogen virksomhed med sans for bundlinjen der vil s tte folk sammen der ikke kan arbejde sammen og det bliver alligevel altid omg et p en eller anden m de derfor siger vi s nu at i stedet for at alle skal v re ens s m dem der er mest ens v re sammen hver dag er en danseskole hvor for ldre skal s rge for at deres b rn kommer til at danse sammen med de rigtige
8712054 den rummelige folkeskole blev et politisk konceptsvar p at der skal v re plads til den forskellighed som i realiteten kan spr nge arbejdet i skolen en af de st rste forklaringsfaktorer p ringe elevpr stationer i pisa unders gelsen er uro i klassen
8712055 i dag er ledelsesrummet ikke givet derfor er det s meget desto mere vigtigt at l reren forst r sig selv som vidensautoritet og ikke som konsulent eller coach problemet med rummeligheden i folkeskolen er at det ikke i tilstr kkelig grad er blevet forbundet med genrejsningen af l reren der skal h ndtere de mere og mere selvst ndiggjorte elever med ipod personlige l ringsstile og mor og far som kr nse brugere
8712056 tidligere gik man ind for den rummelige skole afdiagnostisering og afkategorisering nu g lder det om at f en diagnose for s har man sikkerhed for at der er noget galt med ens barn og n r l reren opdager at der er velbeskrevne grunde til at et barn har faglige vanskeligheder udl ser det ressourcer og det bliver meget nemmere for l reren at rumme barnet i klassen problemet er at den gruppe elever der ikke uden videre kan diagnosticeres udg r uroens epicenter de er p tv rs og er ballademagere mens de diagnostiserede stj ler de specialp dagogiske ressourcer de urolige b rn bliver ladt i stikken
8712057 de skolefolk der er fortalere for en rummelig folkeskole mener at der med et slag p tasken er fem procent der ikke kan rummes i normalklasserne mens de fleste praktikere mener tallet er n rmere 25 pct dem kan man m ske n med p dagogiske midler men det koster afsindigt og de penge har skolerne ikke s de kyniske stopper ved de 25 pct mens de idealistiske k mper videre ned mod de fem procent
8712058 hvordan undg r man at k mpe sig fra de 25 og ned mod de fem procent ved at s tte sine b rn i privatskole tanken om at droppe enhedsskolen er folkeskolens svar p truslen fra privatskolerne der er ikke s mange der sender deres b rn i privatskole som man tror men der er rigtig mange der spekulerer p det

8712074 in the west whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting and some son of a seahorse snapdragon downstream says they are going to steal your water its time to reach for your rifle
8712075 so when you got a guy from arizona saying what we need to do is just move colorados water down i dont think thats a formula for winning colorado and wyoming i dont think its going to make him any friends in utah im sure theyre not going to like that message in nevada or new mexico
8712076 im going to bet you barack obama is not going to steal colorados water and send it downstream
8712077 sin tu saberlo las noches son mi peor angustia y bajo las sombras me ahogo entre mis sue os siento que me faltas tu
8712078 it was difficult i wont tell you that its not because we had some doors shut in our face early
8712079 there were enough young people out there that when we sat down and told them what we expected this program to be and what the vision of this program was going to be that they were able to buy into this vision and they were able to see themselves
8712080 i think i was one of the later players to finally see the vision
8712081 i found it kind of hard to believe while being recruited in 2007 that a year from now that well be playing and i just see a patch of field and a track around it
8712082 i started looking into this conference and i started talking to coach steele and he described to me what the buildings are going to look like how its going to feel all the new incoming atmosphere
8712083 and he told me up front everybodys a freshman and everybodys going to be getting a fair shot and thats all i could ask for
8712084 at campbell steele told him you are kind of small but youre talented
8712085 it was a need to know more thing because the team was not playing for a year but at the same time if i went anywhere else im pretty sure i would have got redshirted and wouldnt play for a year anyway so thats what kind of equaled it out for me
8712086 weve all invested a lot of ourselves in this program
8712087 i have invested a lot of myself in this program in terms of building day by day of this program the small details that need to be taken care of to build a solid program that i felt would represent this university and stand the test of time
8712088 im going to obviously be nervous because we dont know yet where we are this will be the first litmus test of where we stand today because we can guess we can estimate
8712089 but we really dont know until after saturday what we have to do to move the program forward from the way that we handle it administratively as we get a large crowd here to the way we handle players on the football field to the way they handle things they dont know yet we all feel like were as absolutely prepared as we can be but we all have that nervousness and if you dont have that nervousness its time to stop playing the game

8712126 we do see more foreign fighters now though i think coming to pakistan and operating in afghanistan than were seeing in iraq no intelligence agency would say this but it may be that theres been a refocus i think the al qaida knows that they have blown a movement in iraq through a number of missteps over time
8712127 the influence and the presence and the numbers of al qaida in iraq are very much diminished and they had to go somewhere and my guess is my belief is that they probably have gone to that safe haven in the fata
8712128 thats long been an ungoverned area i think were all concerned that if its not managed and it must be managed by the pakistanis its on their side of the border if its not managed that you could see attacks against other parts of pakistan and certainly attacks into afghanistan
8712129 pakistan is a hard nut to crack and its probably not one that we coalition forces are going to be able to solve

8712180 in his oration pro murena for example cicero as he tried to move the jurors to acquit a newly minted roman consul did not ask how the man could go home to face his living family if convicted but what he would say to the grieving mask of his distinguished father that awaited him as he entered elsewhere cicero introduces the dead appius claudius caecus into his oration to ask his disreputable descendant the libidinous claudia how she could ignore the imagines of her ancestors including his

8712189 theres a wholeheartedness to kerry speaking about obama and a total lack of hesitancy and calculation that he always seems to have when hes speaking about himself
8712190 a year ago if you had asked obama strategists david axelrod and david plouffe if they thought kerry would be an important surrogate theyd have laughed but hes been fucking good

8712208 despite concerns that this year couldnt meet the high expectations of world cinema in 2007 it became clear in berlin and cannes that filmmakers are determined to keep reaching new heights
8712209 the new films submitted to us this summer unseen anywhere also continued the trend of quality and unique stories
8712210 this years program brings together a wonderful list of both new and established talent
8712211 one of the things that makes tff so special is that the directors for all the new films will be in attendance to present their films often with performers and writers of their works friendships and new professional relationships are likely to blossom
8712212 we are very proud to welcome dell as part of the telluride film festival family
8712213 dell is adding a dimension to the festival this year that will extend the magic of telluride out in to the film community while uplifting the festival experience for our audiences they are in sync with our goals and recognize that reverence for film and fun can go together
8712214 dell continues to play a key role in enabling individuals as they create access and share their experiences and passions in meaningful ways
8712215 our connection to the telluride film festival is another expression of the companys commitment to creating opportunities for self expression

8712218 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy people are suffering
8712219 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the sadc southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet the mdc are not serious at all
8712220 that all zimbabwe stakeholders should go and sit and finalise all outstanding issues which will pave the way for establishing a stable and peaceful government
8712221 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8712222 once he does that forms a new government then he has put a final nail on this dialogue so what in fact you are doing is you are making people suffer and therefore declaring a war on the people
8712223 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator about the breaches that have occurred
8712224 may be a strategy to arm twist the mdc to accept the deal that is on the table
8712225 the formation of a new government sends a message that talks my have collapsed
8712226 from what we have seen until now through the electoral registration process angolas legislative election has a potential to be a model for the coming elections in africa if all the actors continue to play their part
8712227 there are a lot of expectations in relation to this election we hope that the legislative election in angola will be peaceful and credible

8712232 our financial results in recent years have mirrored the consistent improvement we have achieved in our business and we finish the year with a stronger business
8712233 we enter the new financial year facing slowing global growth and more challenging global economic trends
8712234 but given the strength and diversity of diageos business we believe we can deliver organic operating profit growth for the coming year within our range of 7 0 9 0 per cent
8712235 the main drivers of growth were international where scotch in latin america and beer in africa drove net sales growth of 16 per cent and north america where growth in the priority brands drove a 5 0 per cent increase in net sales
8712236 if it was going to have a major impact we would have seen it by now
8712237 the business environment is rapidly becoming more difficult things remain very uncertain not just in the united states but in emerging countries and resource rich nations as well
8712238 given the price of gasoline and the economic situation it is quite difficult to imagine a dramatic improvement in the japanese market
8712239 it might be true that the market is contracting for us but we have to prepare for future growth
8712240 we must ensure that the market does not shrink as a result of price hikes therefore we have decided to limit the number of models that would be affected
8712241 siempre estamos listos para brindar un alivio adicional al mercado si es necesario
8712242 and it was for this reason that i took it upon myself to do something positive for these talented people it wasnt easy in fact this project was quite stressful at times but i am pleased to say that we made it to the end
8712243 as one who has been there since the start i have to say there is a definite subtheme which i can only express as determination through diversity this is a testament to the myriad of voices the world may not yet have heard
8712244 the process to find these voices was long and at times quite arduous but it is certainly a selection to be proud of
8712245 es un avance plural que sienta la vanguardia en el sistema normativo del pa s
8712246 abatir las desigualdades entre la poblaci n y construir una ciudad con igualdad
8712247 el aborto era letra muerta y lo que se propiciaba era la clandestinidad
8712248 que las mujeres de escasos recursos han accedido a la ley que quede claro que no queremos abortos sino embarazos no deseados
8712249 la cara de felicidad no nos la quita ni la constituci n
8712250 we are the hardest working publisher in the business for new authors and it was fantastic seeing the long lines of retailers requesting autographed copies of books from our authors everybody said it exceeded their expectations
8712251 in the i decided to do something i had put off for many years i wanted to write a book but because i was unknown i couldnt get a publisher to take the financial risk eventually i decided to partner with a publisher which looking back was the best decision i ever made four best selling books and a news career later i make my living writing there are a vast number of undiscovered authors out there who could do the same thing we would like to partner with them to see through their publishing goals
8712252 the problems for new authors have only gotten worse since mega retailers like costco and walmart began carrying the a list authors books at big discounts many local store owners where lesser known authors are typically discovered simply cannot compete with these titans as a result of the downturn for mom and pop shops more and more publishers are focusing on a list authors exclusively while viewing investment in promising but unknown writers as too risky
8712253 most unpublished writers assume that publishers will take care of all their pr needs the truth is currently very few authors even well known and best selling ones receive high priority when it comes to promotion
8712254 what anomalos does in promoting every author to media regardless of fame is unprecedented really
8712255 no hay que darle tanto cr dito a las encuestas
8712256 si tomamos en cuenta el grado de desaprobaci n de bush el alto desempleo la guerra en irak la crisis hipotecaria por la que miles de familias han perdido sus casas y el precio de la gasolina entonces lo normal ser a que obama estuviera liderando la intenci n de voto por muchos puntos
8712257 no nos deber a extra ar lo cerrado de la competencia as fue en otros a os por ejemplo en 2000 la elecci n se decidi por un estado florida est claro que hay una gran polarizaci n en este pa s pero cuando nos centremos en los temas que realmente importan a los estadounidenses como la econom a obama gana
8712258 uno de los obst culos que ha enfrentado obama es su mensaje de cambio que fue tan popular en las primarias ahora que la gente lo ve como candidato presidencial se sienten inseguros
8712259 se niega a utilizar un bot n con la bandera en su saco y por eso nunca podr a votar por ese se or
8712260 dicen que en su avi n no tiene una bandera y la tiene exactamente en el mismo lugar que lo tiene el avi n de mccain dicen que es musulm n cuando es cristiano dicen tantas cosas que son mentira que es muy frustrante
8712261 obama est entra la espada y la pared por un lado la gente le eligi por el cambio pero si quiere ganar el partido necesita utilizar estrategias m s tradicionales tiene que salir y atacar al contrincante

8712273 i think both senator clinton and president clinton gave both compelling endorsements of barack obama but more importantly laid out the choice in this election

8712458 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong

8712468 typically the gps data being used is for the purpose of contradicting defendants alibis

8712476 yeah everyone knows that youre pregnant she announced it yesterday at our departments graduate student organization meeting
8712477 i know because another colleague congratulated me just before class
8712478 i thought it was strange that she made an announcement of such a private matter but i didnt say anything
8712479 it took a while to get our papers graded but considering lilian had a baby i wouldnt hold it against her

8712488 the horrors of the second world war gave impetus to a quest for universal peace justice and human dignity with the united nations at the fore it is a disturbing commentary on our quest that as we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights palestinians mark six decades of what they refer to as the nakba or catastrophe with many languishing in conditions of exile exclusion and isolation this is a testament to our collective failure to give meaning to human dignity for palestinians and to achieve a lasting just peace in the middle east we who serve palestine refugees believe that there is time to make amends exile for sixty years palestine refugees have been in exile from their ancestral lands nowhere is this more starkly visible than in the west bank where the illegal barrier hundreds of checkpoints and physical obstructions daily reinforce the exile and in gaza the policies of closure and indiscriminate punishment devastate lives causing mass despair threatening to destroy hopes for peace exclusion palestine refugees also face exclusion from the justice afforded by international law the aim of which is to offer the protection security and dignity taken for granted in a world where respect for human rights and the rule of law have become guiding principles of global governance embodied in the canons of international law are clear prohibitions against systematic attacks against civilian populations against deliberately depriving civilians of food against the intentional destruction of civilian infrastructure and against the transfer of an occupying powers population onto the land it occupies the violations of these and other provisions serve to underscore among palestinians a sense of exclusion from the protection of the international system

8712520 when sending an email to multiple recipients from different companies put addresses in the bcc field your audience will appreciate the fact that you are cognizant of protecting their privacy
8712521 to expound on my point i am not just talking about large email blasts for example i recently received an email from a conference organizer that was sent to the 12 speakers lined up for the next days agenda i blanched when i saw all recipient email addresses in the to field in listing our addresses in this manner the sender put our information at risk of being scooped up by anyone desiring to grow their contact database
8712522 use bccs to keep addresses confidential for instance if you write to 10 people who do not know one another send them bccs rather than revealing everyones address in the to line

8712568 its not the fact he needs help that bothers me its well its the fact you plan on staying there i mean the last time you two were there alone
8712569 i cant believe this you are not gonna forgive me are you johnny i told you what happened with garret an me wasnt intended why cant you believe that
8712570 you slept with him thats not a little thing jenna
8712571 or what jenna i can leave i can what finish your thought
8712572 johnny it simply meant i care what happens to garret so you will just have to understand this please
8712573 not long two or three days tops i love you
8712574 thanks for this being here i know john didnt agree
8712575 yeah right he doesnt want you near me jade thats clear i wonder though is that how you feel
8712576 no i want to be here garret since we um since that night when we had sex im feeling things i never have before i just dont know what to do about it
8712577 me too i mean weve always been close but um ive gone over all the parts i remember of that night jade it was a beautiful moment between us an honest moment ive never felt before
8712578 i know what youre saying garret i feel it too we connected didnt we
8712579 i have feeling for you jade stronger than i ever realized i miss you so much is it like that for you

8712583 im glad you told me garret i think i love you too i havent know as long as you i just started second guessing everything when we made love it seems the more i think about you the more fault i find in john i know when i was 18 he wasnt right for me i didnt realize that till after i moved out of here and in with him thing is the baby i really do not know which of you is the father if john is the father garret i cant deny him his child you know that right
8712584 if the baby is his he should be a part of his or her world id want the same thing jade would you stay with him knowing you love me for the babys sake only
8712585 no no i wont but i cant just move back here either garret i mean if its true that somehow we connected then we need to take it slow and discover what a relationship together can be like from a man loving a woman perspective unlike what we had before do you understand

8712616 you idiot dont you know you are supposed to use the correct tape on lights they get hot
8712617 dont you know you cant use masking tape on stage lights after awhile they get hot and the stuff fucking melts
8712618 oh is that all you have to say i was right in the middle of the fourth act the middle of my part and then it starts raining colored gels on to the stage suddenly they were splatting everywhere we finished the play running around the stage in circles hunched over with our hands over out heads yelling our lines
8712619 because the audience was laughing so loud it was the only way we could make ourselves heard david you bastard you you fucking murdered my chekhov and then she broke down and sobbing put her head on the table with a dramatic thump
8712620 uhh excuse me david you horrible legitimate theatre anarchist can you please pass the bread

8712630 hoy la discusi n p blica est generando y est llegando a unos niveles de intolerancia que la verdad se pregunta uno c mo es posible pedirles tolerancia a las personas en los campos y en las ciudades cuando al nivel m s alto de la dirigencia pol tica no estamos mostrando la posiblidad de tener ese di logo constructivo
8712631 tambi n quiero invitar al se or presidente a que en un momento donde nos acusan de cosas injustas lo aceptemos con la dignidad del cargo manejemos la situaci n con concordia y demos el ejempo que el 80 por ciento de los colombianos hoy respalda
8712632 invito al gabinete a que en este momento tan dificil demos un paso atr s y busquemos el escenario de concordia sin ep tetos en el que los temas para este pa s que est buscando esta nueva salida sean hechos sobre la discusi n publica fraterna
8712633 a m me ha tocado tambi n aguantar palo estuve sub judice un a o por las acusaciones de mancuso en ese a o me qued callado aguant a pesar de que en innumerables ocasiones sectores de derechos humanos y de la izquierda utilizaron esa herramienta en escenarios internacionales
8712634 hago un llamado a que en vez de buscar el objetivo inmediato de hacerle da o al gobierno o tratar de tumbar ministro esperemos a que la justicia act e frente a las acusaciones que hay sobre su hermano y que nos sentemos con ese ministro que viene de las entra as del congreso a que aprovechemos esa discusi n para tener una reforma pol tica de largo alcance

8712640 si primul calculator l am cumparat pentru a juca sah cu el fiind sportiv aveam pasaport diplomatic si puteam iesi din tara asa am facut rost in clasele generale de un comodore 64 in care incarcam programe si baze de date pentru sah luate din iugoslavia
8712641 pentru ca eram ocupat cu turneele si n am fost bine pregatit am intrat la liceu printre ultimii dupa primul trimestru parintii au fost chemati la scoala pentru ca aveam 3 si 4 la matematematica situatia era diferita fata de ciclul gimnazial unde profesorii ma cunosteau si unde puteam recupera materia si atunci parintii mei au inceput sa intervina pentru ca au vazut ca din sah nu se poate face o viata nu este unul dintre sporturile din care poti sa monetizezi foarte bine
8712642 a fost prima incercare de business si era in liceu aduceam calculatoare pe care le vindeam la prieteni era cash pay era o afacere de familie intre prieteni si pe care o promovam prin mica publicitate in ziar
8712643 cred ca au fost cam 10 numere dintre care 5 pe print si restul pe internet am renuntat apoi pentru ca a venit o perioada mai grea din punct de vedere economic a fost trecerea pe internet lipsa de publicitate si cea de software pentru programare
8712644 eram in anul doi de facultate si am zis ca trebuie sa invat cum se fac afacerile si pe urma sa o fac si pe a mea eram in anul doi la economie si cum luasem decizia sa las afacerea si aveam timp mai mult m am inscris si la drept se spune ca orice esec se transforma intr un pas inainte si s a canalizat spre drept una dintre cele mai bune inclinatii pentru business acum recomand ase ul si dreptul viitorilor manageri atat timp cat nu exista scoli dedicate de business in romania dreptul combinat cu economia dau cea mai mare consistenta
8712645 nu voiam o cariera in ministerul de finante si urmaream sa trec in mediul privat insa imi cam pierdusem perspectiva ca lucrurile au sa se indrepte era si criza economica mineriadele si atunci am luat decizia sa aplic la o bursa in strainatate la universitatea din masachussetts am facut toate aplicatiile in decembrie 2000 am fost admis impreuna cu un coleg dar a trebuit sa mai stau 6 luni pentru a ma licentia in drept
8712646 florentin banu m a sunat in februarie 2001 si m a invitat sa ne intalnim sa discutam despre un proiect de business totul era aranjat pentru america dar el m a intors cu o singura fraza te duci sa faci un mba iti va lua 4 ani vei acumula credite si vei avea cunostinte din mediul economic abstract in timp ce eu iti dau posibilitatea sa vezi cum se face business aici si te si platesc nu am facut mba dar am invatat cum se fac afacerile cred ca a fost mai bine
8712647 daca vrei sa fii performant in ceea ce faci pe plan profesional trebuie sa ai si un echilibru in ceea ce priveste viata privata trebuie sa faci lucrurile care iti plac in afara biroului cert este ca atunci cand incepi un business nou aceste aspecte sunt mai greu de echilibrat a fost mai greu la inceput dar am invatat apoi sa deleg catre colegi pentru ca pana la urma managerii lucreaza pentru propria redundanta ca sa se poata desprinde de organizatiile pe care le au creat
8712648 imi doresc sa cunosc lumea sa plec pe o perioada mai lunga de timp voi face acest remote management nu voi mai sta in fiecare zi la birou si voi da oamenilor din jurul meu posibilitatea sa creasca sa se dezvolte
8712649 acum la sfarsitul lui august urmeaza 10 zile cu motocicleta prin alpi voi pleca cu unul dintre parteneri sa facem turul alpilor vom merge cu avionul pana la m nchen de acolo in elvetia si pe urma in austria
8712650 the notaries interpreted the modification of last years fiscal code in their own way when the judicial and stamp taxes were replaced by
8712651 they are now charging the same taxes twice on the leasing contract and treat it as two different sale purchase contracts instead of treating it as a loan contract
8712652 the client pays the taxes for the one million euros twice and the product is much more expensive this is why some are looking towards other funding sources such as bank loans out of the six or seven companies that offer real estate leasing two or three have notified the association that they no longer plan to offer such a service both because of the raise in taxes and of the international financial crisis
8712653 the economic owner of the asset is its user right from the beginning the client of the leasing company therefore they should not be taxed when buying the asset at the end of the contract
8712654 late last year we lost an important customer heineken but in the first half of this year we covered the gap by gaining new customers we may not experience growth like last year when turnover increased 36 but we expect a two digit performance
8712655 desi piata de telecom si a incetinit cresterea rezultatele financiare ale cosmote romania pentru al doilea trimestru al anului demonstreaza o continua dezvoltare pe toate segmentele avand toate aceste aspecte in vedere cosmote romania isi mentine tinta de a atinge ebitda pozitiv pentru intreg anul 2008 de asemenea estimez ca vom continua sa ne crestem constant cota de piata

8712657 colnago este cunoscut ca fiind ferrari ul bicicletelor asa ca asocierea cu brandul de masini nu a fost nicio surpriza
8712658 este o bicicleta de curse dar multi dintre cei care si au achizitionat o o pastreaza in birou ca pe un fel de trofeu pentru a fi admirata ca o opera de arta
8712659 bicicleta este construita din materiale usoare si are scheletul de carbon asa ca este foarte eficienta

8712662 pretul petrolului este un indicator important pe care cei care vor sa investeasca in acest sector ar trebui sa l urmareasca pentru ca el este cel care determina companiile petroliere sa si intensifice programele de investitii cotatia petrolului este si acum destul de sus iar firmele de servicii vor beneficia de crestere
8712663 marjele de profitabilitate ale companiilor de servicii petroliere sunt un pic mai ridicate la noi fata de cele ale companiilor similare din regiune totusi este de asteptat ca acestea sa se mentina pentru ca in general sunt servicii specializate iar concurentii sunt destul de putin prezenti pe piata
8712664 cu toate ca noul renault symbol prezentat miercuri in cadrul salonului auto de la moscova n red nu a fost dezvoltat in romania in cadrul rtr acesta va fi imbunatatit alaturi de modelul logan

8712668 eu nu am vointa asupra mea tata se cazneste sa faca ceva din mine si nu poate de mii de ori imi spune sa exersez la vioara si eu nu pot sa ii indeplinesc nici atat de mica placere
8712669 azi din nou am fost la vie impreuna cu tata de multe ori se iveste in fiinta mea un fel de indemn de impulsiune care ma face sa iubesc pe iubitii mei parinti la nebunie mi se rupe inima de durere cand vad vreodata pe tata sau pe mama dojenindu ma acum sunt mare trebuie sa judec bine tot ce fac
8712670 numai lucruri rele azi cum mam dus la scoala baietii si profesorii viin cu reaua veste ca se prelungesc cursurile pana la 15 iunie apoi dupa masa acasa imi moare papagalul durerea ce am avut o cu aceasta ocazie era atat de mare de parcami murise cineva din familie l am ingropat in gradina pe bunul si fidelul papagal care era pe lume dupa mama si tata singurul care ma iubea sincer si il iubeam acum sa dus dumnezeu e puternic si mare

8712709 ive been in the q for two seasons and wanted to get to that next level so when the swedish team called and wanted me i really felt playing senior hockey on that level would only enhance my skills
8712710 i signed for one year and hopefully when i come back to north america ill be ready to take that next step with the flyers
8712711 when i return to sweden ill continue to play the style of game that i learned in north america because thats why the flyers drafted me and thats what the flyers staff wants me to do ill continue to showcase my quickness and square me shoulder to the net when given the chance
8712712 going back to sweden doesnt mean that hed be out of our plans but simply that it might be a better fit for him right now
8712713 hes at a point where we have to decide what is best for his development
8712714 my coach at st johns real paiement taught me how to play good defense and thats something ill certainly take with me
8712715 in europe i was more like a guy with great speed who would look to get those chance breakaways but that strategy didnt work out so well in north america as it did in europe so i had to learn to play a little bit different and it was a great learning experience
8712716 coach paiement actually named me assistant captain in my first season and that was something i didnt expect at all especially since i was just coming over from sweden and my english wasnt very good but coach told me that he wanted me to be an assistant because i showed good respect for the game and i always gave it 100 percent and those are the qualities i want to bring to the flyers some day in the locker room im a little bit laid back and quiet and really having the a on your jersey is much like an assistant coach you just have to pick your spots and lead by example
8712717 my goal is to play with the flyers and im going to do everything i can to make that happen
8712718 the new rules in the nhl can only help me im not very big so if i continue to move my feet and make things happen ill be able to draw a lot of penalties for our team and then get some time on the power play and score some goals
8712719 my goal is to play with the flyers and im going to do everything i can to make that happen
8712720 i have my own style but ill try and watch how other great players do it like pavel bure and marion gaborik speed mario lemieux the shortest distance to the goal and mikael renberg grinder
8712721 i enjoy playing for the fans and try and watch players with a similar style to mine it gives me more ideas and things to work on
8712722 i dont think he tends to get the credit he deserves as a two way player because he is often looked at as just an offensive player but he played for us in all situations in 2007 08 including the penalty kill hes the type of player that i think will have a role as a situational player even if he is not a big offensive player because he is very versatile
8712723 first of all that is why its so important that our players come to camp in shape which we believe they will i think it is critical that our players have done their rigorous offseason training program so we can get into camp and get going right away we will continue to implement systems every day including game days and use the preseason games to instill some of the systems and identities of our hockey team as we move through training camp
8712724 we practice our breakout execution every day and we will make it specific to our opponent the day before we play sometimes is it not always possible when you play back to back games but most teams have a similar forechecking scheme so we do tailor it towards our next opponent if time allows
8712725 as we move into this year we are without some players that we had last year so he is going to have to assume some of the responsibilities of the players that are no longer here i think glen has proven that he can be a well rounded player hes defensively responsible he will end up being a utility guy that can move up and down your lineup as needed
8712726 yes we have had a lot of discussions abut the captaincy with the vacancy created by jason smith moving on we are hopeful that we can have a guy in place by the start of training camp
8712727 for me it was more of a favorite player i was a big bobby orr fan growing up i was a young defenseman and he was a player that revolutionized that game at that point bobby orr was the guy i looked up to
8712728 there have been many i have spent the bulk of my career in the american hockey league i played with jim mckenzie in springfield i played with frank bialowas with the phantoms and steve mclaren with the phantoms certainly riley cote has got to be in that group in terms of guys that i have coached there are a lot of tough guys out there and those are certainly a few guys that come to mind
8712729 all of them i think the atlantic division will be every bit as competitive and difficult as it was last year pittsburgh will continue to be a power house i think the devils have improved their team i think the rangers are always going to be a threat the islanders will be a threat they are going with what seems like a younger team which will make them a very competitive team every night it will be as every bit as difficult as it was last year
8712730 i have learned through experience to be able to think under pressure those who know me know i am a very competitive guy with a really strong fire burning inside but i learned to control that on the outside to be able to think through the emotions of the game and be able to think for the team i have a saying a frightened captain makes for a frightened crew i try to make sure that we continue to operate even in adverse times
8712731 i say its 75 percent mitt and 25 percent joementum

8712838 ar fi foarte neobisnuit ca romania sa poata evita efectele incetinirii economice care are loc la nivel global antrenata de criza creditului politica fiscala este in prezent destul de relaxata iar in conditiile in care economia va incetini guvernul va trebui sa decida daca vrea sa intareasca politica fiscala accentuand scaderea sau sa permita o crestere semnificativa a deficitului bugetar
8712839 inflatia ridicata deficitul de cont curent substantial cresterea rapida a salariilor si a creditului toate constituie semne ale unei economii supraincalzite este imposibil de spus cu exactitate care este cresterea economica potentiala neinflationista insa probabil ca aceasta este mai apropiata de 6 decat de 8 pe an
8712840 este putin probabil ca romania sa fie retrogradata in afara grupei tarilor cu risc scazut pentru investitii

8712843 daca guvernul ar fi decis privatizarea acestor complexuri energetice am fi fost interesati sa cumparam mai ales datorita sinergiilor care s ar fi creat prin faptul ca cez detine distributia pe zona respectiva

8712845 zona de atractie pentru marile retele de magazine este in principal bucurestiul unul dintre lucrurile care i au impiedicat pana acum pe retaileri sa se extinda mai mult in capitala este pretul terenurilor
8712846 trebuie sa se tina cont si de faptul ca in momentul in care un retailer alege sa se duca intr un oras din provincie acesta ia in calcul si locuitorii din localitatile invecinate de obicei cele aflate la o ora de mers cu masina de orasul respectiv
8712847 odata cu cresterea veniturilor diferenta de pret intre oferta din hipermarket si cea din supermarket nu va mai fi atat de importanta pentru consumatorii romani
8712848 nu trebuie sa fim pesimisti in ceea ce priveste evolutia pretului actiunilor companiei

8712850 majoritatea populatiei romaniei are o conformatie psihospirituala care corespunde cu sentimentele ideile imaginile formele de exprimare versificata si pattern urile muzicale care caracterizeaza orientalista melismatica senzuala vitalista impudica si zdrobitoarea manea

8712853 da face parte din familia producatorilor de frigidere dar ca acest lucru nu i a fost de mare ajutor in perioada stalinista
8712854 pentru ca zvonistica si folclorul sa nu functioneze la intrebarea de ce plec raspunsul meu este nici uzura nici divergente de opinii nici slabe performante nici comoditate nici dorinta de schimbare niciun sablon simt nevoia sa las pe cineva care sa si doreasca sa realizeze alaturi de voi mai mult decat mi am dorit si am realizat eu
8712855 nu pot sa spun ce voi face daca nu spun mai intai ce am facut
8712856 e mult prea devreme pentru orice discutie multi dintre cei cu care am lucrat mi au repetat obsesiv ca cel mai bun lucru pe care il pot face este sa lucrez pentru mine nu pentru altii pe de alta parte exista o lipsa evidenta de manageri de top la nivel de economie
8712857 nimeni nu a avut viziunea a amp d pharma de astazi exista o strategie care a si fost urmata insa era simpla vizam atunci extinderea portofoliului prima divizie a avut succes asa ca am lansat o pe a doua am adus nurofen strepsils toate produsele de la boots care intr adevar au fost de impact si sunt si astazi lideri de piata
8712858 poate chiar prea antreprenori la un moment dat am avut retineri in ceea ce priveste extinderile exagerate in foarte multe business uri dar in final strategia a reusit stiu foarte bine sa se orienteze in piete precum cea a romaniei care nu a fost simpla in toti acesti ani
8712859 eu sunt chiar mai in varsta decat actionarii imi aduc aminte de numarul de la masina eu aveam cu 67 ei cu 68 aveam o dacie b 67 blu era masina de serviciu si avea un trifoi mare cu upsa pri mele produse cu care a amp d pharma a inceput dis tributia n red pe capota acel trifoi mi a adus noroc
8712860 din punctul de vedere al actionarilor poate fi 2006 poate chiar si din perspectiva managerilor cel mai bun an cred ca a fost cel in care am trecut pe locul intai in piata farma in 2003 atunci m am simtit placut pentru ca era un reper catre care tintisem
8712861 comparatiile eronate facute cu prima jumatate a anului trecut nu favorizeaza in niciun fel imaginea reala de fapt cred ca ar trebui sa comparam cu a doua jumatate din 2007 cand am avut conditii de piata oarecum similare cu devalorizare cu preturi blocate si am inregistrat pierderi in prima jumatate a acestui an am avut profit fata de pierderile din 2007
8712862 pretul actiunilor este influentat de trendul de pe pietele internationale de capital de rezultatele noastre de anul trecut care la randul lor au fost influentate de factori de reglementare a pietei cum sunt blocarea preturilor precum de lipsa de expertiza intr un nou mediu cel de companie publica si de aparitia unor costuri pe care nu le am anticipat
8712863 lipsa lichiditatii creeaza presiune pe pret iar aceste lucruri nu pot fi gestionate de niciun manager operational
8712864 saptamana trecuta am achizitionat actiuni bcc in valoare de 100 000 de lei si voi mai cumpara pentru ca vreau sa imi consolidez pozitia vreau sa ajung pana la o detinere de 40 pentru ca actiunile isi vor reveni

8712869 notarii au interpretat in felul lor modificarea codului fiscal de anul trecut cand taxa judiciara si taxa de timbru au fost inlocuite cu o singura taxa cea cadastrala acum ei aplica de doua ori aceleasi taxe unui contract de leasing imobiliar si il trateaza ca pe doua contracte distincte de vanzare cumparare refuzand sa ii recunoasca calitatea de contract de creditare
8712870 astfel clientul plateste de doua ori taxele aferente unui milion de euro iar produsul este mult mai scump din cele sase sapte companii care practica leasing imobiliar doua trei au anuntat asociatia ca nu mai vor sa practice aceasta linie de business atat ca urmare a cresterii taxelor cat si a crizei financiare internationale
8712871 proprietarul economic al bunului este de la bun inceput utilizatorul acestuia clientul companiei de leasing deci el nu ar mai trebui taxat atunci cand cumpara bunul la finalul contractului substanta economica a leasingului imobiliar nu este ca un bun se vinde si se cumpara de doua ori pentru ca el este utilizat tot timpul de aceeasi persoana in momentul de fata notarii au devenit o casta carora statul le a dat posibilitatea sa taxeze contribuabilii onorariile lor foarte mari nu au nicio legatura cu volumul de munca depus

8712926 essentially a major upgrade to part of telstras existing network
8712927 the opposition has made it clear that if a 4 7 billion of taxpayers money is to be utilised then we need commensurate public policy gains were not about imposing new burdens on taxpayers shareholders or corporations were about saying if you want the money there are strings attached
8712928 and we believe that achieving effective structural separation has to be one of those things because the natural monopoly that will be produced requires that kind of clarity
8712929 overseas experience has already proven that separation does not work it increases costs reduces efficiencies limits future innovation and most importantly kills off investment
8712930 telstra is puzzled by mr billsons reported comments given that this wednesday morning the office of the leader of the opposition confirmed that structural separation of telstra is explicitly not coalition policy
8712931 it would be totally irresponsible for mr billson to suggest that telstra should be further separated given that the coalition sold shares to 1 4 million shareholders who paid billions of dollars to the government as part of the t3 process only a few months ago telstra is not and will not be a political play thing
8712932 the opposition repeats that it seeks to impose no new burden on telstra or its shareholders but if telstra puts its hand out for a 4 7 billion of taxpayer money commensurate public policy gains are required
8712933 ironically the speech mr quilty has reacted to called for greater dialogue and openness about the broadband choices australia faces and how little attention is being paid to the national and consumer interests under labors vague troubled and stalled nbn tender process
8712934 telstra as weve highlighted in various speeches in the last little while is the international gold medalist in terms of profit earnings across the entire developed world sol trujillo last week to quote him said weve sustained both broadband market share gains and average revenue per user growth a feat virtually unheard of among incumbents around the globe
8712935 he sol trujillo is genuinely proud and understandably proud that they have been able to maintain profitability because of the poor market structure and poor regulation weve had in australia and the end outcome is we have the highest broadband prices in the oecd or close to the highest

8712937 i do not believe it is sufficient to form a basis for recall

8712941 crews had the fire knocked down a couple of minutes after arriving at the scene and had the woman pulled out a minute or so after that

8712943 we did get pulse and respiration back and allina transported the woman to hcmcs hyperbaric chamber around 2 20 p m
8712944 we still dont have a cause of the fire but we are pretty confident it started in the bedroom on the north end of the structure there was a lot of damage

8712988 96 year old mother could beat the crap out of gore vidal with her shoe and you can quote me on that
8712989 are the republicans controlling this conversation the conversation with the american people this week
8712990 this is a place where we pay tribute to football stars and rock stars and maybe it shows once again this campaign is less about substance and more about the cult of personality
8712991 senator obama arrived in denver shortly before the nomination became official he was able to see it from his hotel room with his family what was his reaction
8712992 tonight here its almost like a super bowl atmosphere is there fear that the message may be lost
8712993 not at all we think opening up the convention to average americans is really important next week john mccain will choose to be with his insiders and lobbyists who are running his campaign
8712994 you talk about grass roots and people thinking about conventions from years past youre in a convention hall the balloons are coming down theres a certain tradition that we wont have theres a new tradition that youre starting is there a risk in that
8712995 no doubt this is the biggest speech of barack obamas life and he has to strike the right balance enormous amount of pressure that he is under what do you want to hear from him tonight what do you want the people to hear from him tonight
8712996 you had an idea probably coming into the convention what you wanted to accomplish how do you judge how this convention has been received by the american people
8712997 it looks like theyre going to play the super bowl of politics there tonight
8712998 before we talk about what the senator is going to say tonight in his speech lets talk a little bit about where we are this football field invesco field at mile high and already youre starting to hear some at the mccain campaign and at the rnc say wait a second this is a place where we pay tribute to football stars and rock stars and maybe it shows once again this campaign is less about substance and more about the cult of personality how do you respond
8712999 let me ask you about symbolism though whats the deal with the set here the greek revival pillars you know the mccain campaign or the rnc says its the temple of obama are the pillars supposed to remind us of the lincoln memorial and the i have a dream speech 45 years ago is that the idea
8713000 so in specifics thats what hes going to talk about because youve seen this campaign ad from the john mccain campaign using hillary clintons own words saying barack obama im paraphrasing here a little more than a speech from 2002 will he get down to brass tacks tonight
8713001 what can we expect tonight here at what some people are calling the barackopolis with the ancient greek columns i have heard that there is going to be some influences from the past speeches from bill clinton as well as ronald reagan and all the way back to 1960 and john f kennedy
8713002 over the last couple of days we have seen hillary and bill clinton slowly lead the stage here at the democratic national convention with a big endorsement of senator obama last night from the former president shows video clip of clinton praise it was a pretty strong endorsement by anyones measure last night but then you still have these lingering comments from earlier in the primary season from him from hillary clinton that the mccain campaign is trying to use to its advantage how can you counter that particularly when he is so far ahead on these issues of leadership and who would be the better commander in chief
8713003 weve done britneys sets and a whole bunch of rock shows but this was far more elaborate and complicated and we had to do it in far less time
8713004 the biggest challenge has been making sure we dont damage the playing field underneath
8713005 the more you see the less you know the less you find out as you go i knew much more then than i do now
8713006 hail obama master of the universe we hail you as our glorious leader
8713007 one of the most respected and listened to political voices in this country
8713008 it helps to have some candidates you know who are not necessarily matlockian
8713009 our athenian a voice for democratic ideals and the noble place of citizenship helped along by the sound of laughter
8713010 shes a democrat she must prove she loves america as opposed to republicans who everyone knows love america they just hate half the people living in it
8713011 im not going anywhere im throwing my hat back in the ring
8713012 when i think the democratic party is wrong im willing to say it im willing to speak up and willing vote for what i think is right
8713013 no one is for partition unless of course youre an iranian backed political party because theyd love to have a self governing zone in the south that effectively would become an extension of iran
8713014 he was an early adopter of facebook and has an excellent understanding of how technology can be used in the political realm
8713015 this is probably one of the most important auditions theyll go through in their lives
8713016 oprah is not a political animal thats why her endorsement of barack is such a big deal
8713017 i love the position he took on gay marriage yeah he had that kerfuffle a while back with that woman
8713018 weve been critical this week of the democrats buchanan and i because were mean spirited republicans saying that the democrats needed to go more aggressively against george bushs eight years of failure tying mccain to bush
8713019 in ten seconds i could write a speech and say what do you say about a party that comes to washington takes it over promises to balance the budget and turns bill clintons 150 billion surplus into a 500 billion debt what do you say about a party that says they are going to fight for our children when in fact they are bankrupting the american dream
8713020 im not saying i necessarily believe in these characterizations but if i were writing for a democrat i would say exactly this is a party that lied us into war that stole from future generations and left the most poor and helpless among us waiting for help in new orleans while they starved to death something like that ka boom it would have exploded
8713021 i think that maybe in their gut a lot of democrats just dont have the killer instinct that the republicans have for whatever reason democrats feel shame about wiping somebody off the map and so they feel well look lets go after john mccain but lets do it in a more intellectual fashion lets do it in a reasoned fashion they dont need to make democrats hate president bush anymore and so maybe they just think well lets just go about it in a reasonable fashion instead of the killer line
8713022 well because i think this convention is trying to be authentic to who barack obama is and he is not an old school red meat attack the other guy politician he is somebody who actually sincerely authentically wants to change the political maneuvering in these campaigns he wants to make it about appealing to the better side of america not just take out this baseball bat and whack away
8713023 we should immediately give every working family in america a

8713078 then you met angela she was staying at her aunts a nice old bird with a cat thats got self confidence problems you met her you fell for her all the old tricks the batted eyes the pouting mouth you fell for it but then you were in a spot
8713079 it it was all too fast i was nineteen she was talking of getting married nineteen
8713080 i was failing all my classes art history with mendelson if i didnt make at least a c they said theyd kick me out angela she said she had a way a leg up
8713081 she said it was guaranteed no risk she liked me she said so i took it yes i saw an opportunity i took it
8713082 shes tough forceful i didnt want to but she said shed expose me stay away from that little girlfriend of yours or else
8713083 in the end i couldnt tell sandy anything she wouldnt understand itd be too much to explain so i stayed away for her and for me i stayed away
8713084 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8713085 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8713086 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8713087 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8713088 just because theyre upset that the little pet of certain western capitals didnt fulfil their expectations
8713089 there is no nato naval build up in the black sea as russian authorities are claiming in the media
8713090 the sco member states express their deep concern over the recent tensions surrounding the south ossetia question and call for the sides to peacefully resolve existing problems through dialogue
8713091 i was up 4 1 up in the first set and then i let it go to 4 4
8713092 i was lucky that i held my serve there is more room to improve hopefully in the next match i can do better
8713093 i guess i am better at just knowing what to do on the court
8713094 i found my weapons on the court and i know when to use them
8713095 ive been working a lot on every shot i spend a lot of time on my conditioning if im faster it helps me to play my game to be aggressive on the court
8713096 we feel there is a need to bring in some fresh legs for this match
8713097 last weekends win took a lot out of the guys
8713098 i obviously respect his opinion and we get along great and were pretty close
8713099 i know his family well and his baby girl and his wife but at the same time he captains our davis cup team so who knows if thats a conflict of interest in any way shape or form with the other players
8713100 theres no way he can be davis cup captain and coach against one of his other players thats just impossible
8713101 it a permanent arrangement is not really even worth discussing because i dont think its in the realm of possibility
8713102 it was pretty obvious who would be the best fit to help me out for this just this tournament
8713103 ill probably get to that decision on a permanent coach i have a fair amount of time after this to figure it out
8713104 johns been feeling the effects of the road for a little while when we first got together it was temporary
8713105 he was kind of just helping me out and was going to help and then all of a sudden its two and a half years later
8713106 the large crowd that we expect is indicative of the campaign that senator obama has run from the beginning change happens from the bottom up
8713107 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8713108 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8713109 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8713110 all flights have been cancelled and passengers are being advised to seek bookings with alternative airlines
8713111 the unprecedented rise in the price of aviation fuel which resulted in a 50 million dollar us increase in operating costs during the last year and the general economic downturn had made it impossible for operations to continue
8713112 a direct consequence of the horrendous increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate
8713113 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8713114 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8713115 the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8713116 we have sought creditor protection by filing legal notices of intention to appoint an administrator in both the united kingdom and canada
8713117 the important thing is making a good start we took one point from the first three games last season and weve got to do better
8713118 there are no easy games you just take it as it comes we are just delighted to be in it
8713119 we know it wont be easy but we know liverpool from p laying them last year that could be an advantage for us but also for them
8713120 romanian football has come on a lot and fiorentina were semi finalists in last seasons uefa cup and had a good season in italy well have to get points pretty much everywhere

8713127 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8713128 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8713129 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8713130 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year
8713131 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualized economic growth to recede to near 1 0 percent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving
8713132 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast

8713144 the last couple of days i feel like ive been bowling much better
8713145 today at least a few pins fell its still kind of frustrating because i did throw a lot of good shots hopefully i can sneak into the medal play
8713146 i dont know why but for me knocking pins down in this house is really tough
8713147 relative to everything else this is the best round ive had the lane conditions are fairly challenging the short pattern got a little high scoring at times but the long oil pattern is definitely challenging
8713148 there are a lot of great bowlers out here outside of the united states i knew there was but there are a lot more than i thought you have to make good shots hopefully this wont be my last appearance at the world championships
8713149 one under was a good score today with the wind and the soft greens
8713150 i didnt have a one or two footer all day that i didnt think might miss
8713151 i know theyre wet but i said the same last year when they were dry
8713152 i think that some greens drain better than these theres no question so well have to look into that at a future date
8713153 this was ok one over is by no means out of this tournament
8713154 i decided id do my best to make the team because she always wanted me to play the ryder cup
8713155 ive always wanted to play in nicks team im very tired but as long as i give it everything and leave everything out on the course this week ill be satisfied
8713156 the business plan was absolutely unbelievable and the connection from grassroots hockey in this province hockey alberta the western hockey league to the two nhl teams was as good as weve ever seen
8713157 it will be the first time that every player in this event will get to play in an nhl arena and that is special for european players as well as canadian players
8713158 well definitely have a schedule where the canadian team will have to stay in one arena for the regular games and the finals will be in the other
8713159 weve worked that through pretty well with the committee already and we feel very confident that both sites are going to be well looked after from the canadian side
8713160 weve looked at pricing and weve looked at demographics and we said you know what edmonton can make this work with canada in their pool
8713161 and the medal games can go to calgary because of scheduling and a bunch of other variables and there was never a bone of contention between us
8713162 it is absolutely ok that hockey goes where hockey is strong junior hockey in the iihf would not be the same without canada
8713163 it was absolutely the right thing to do our teams appreciate travelling dont underestimate the positives for all the other teams playing the swedes the finns the russians playing in canada in a country where hockey is what it is these experiences they take home will help hockey in other countries
8713164 theres no question we expect this to break all the attendance records because it will be the first time weve been able to play all the games in nhl buildings
8713165 in ottawa its going to break a record but its going to continue to grow but when you look ahead to 2012 this should set records too
8713166 sic stands for psychoanalytic interpretation at its most elementary no discovery of deep hidden meaning just the act of drawing attention to the litterality sic of what precedes it a sic reminds us that what was said inclusive of its blunders was effectively said and cannot be undone the series sic thus explores different connections to the freudian field each volume provides a bundle of lacanian interventions into a specific domain of ongoing theoretical cultural and ideological political battles it is neither pluralist nor socially sensitive unabashedly avowing its exclusive lacanian orientation it disregards any form of correctness but the inherent correctness of theory itself
8713167 they deserve money they deserve what we promised and they deserve to have it now
8713168 weve already laid off all these people and theyve gotten nothing
8713169 as a region director i had 50 schools and a 250 million construction budget i have the skills now all we have to do is make sure were all working for the same goal

8713185 there is a powerful human impulse known as the rule of rescue to attempt to help an identifiable person whose life is in danger no matter how much it costs
8713186 nice recognises that when it is making its decisions it should consider the needs of present and future patients of the nhs who are anonymous and who do not necessarily have people to argue their case on their behalf the institute has not therefore adopted an additional rule of rescue
8713187 we would be opposed to ignoring a rule of rescue when it introduces a degree of flexibility around extreme cases so what if you waste a few pounds if you are doing your best for humanity

8713192 that just looks bad like im not focusing on baseball but kathy said no its not an endorsement its not because of who you are or that you play baseball this is a modeling gig the thing i like best about this story is that with anyone else thered be a sizable outrage after noting that he flew to maui for a fashion shoot on an offday during the season report abuse zitos just a gamer report abuse what a tool yeah he pitches like a male model report abuse barry zito in oakland was not side tracked by this stuff now that he has the big bucks it shows how a lot of this can go to an athletes head he needs to focus more on his pitching than this crap although the giants are clearly out of any playoff contention he should still be developing his strengths report abuse a gamer doesnt mind if a photo shoot goes a half an hour long report abuse thats like so lame and gay and stuff he looks like so such a douche report abuse why do people have to put him down and such good for him he has other interests besides baseball report abuse although im not a fan of zito i must say that this article is very deceiving i read the actual article this morning in the san jose mercury and they make it very clear that zito is not endorsing true religion the news clip shown from the sj merc seems contradictory since zito states in the article that he doesnt want to be endorsing any products yet is seen in the new true religion campaign like mentioned in this article the guy who wanted zito to model the jeans saw zito in the tourist magazine with a guitar in hand he thought that zito was a musician let alone a professional baseball player its just a terrible coincidence that zito happens to be a major league pitcher with a cloud of controversy surrounding him report abuse uh huh huh san francisco huh huh report abuse apparently zito has been posing as a pitcher also report abuse who cares about his record is the poster for sale he looks pretty hot report abuse a gamer always has the warrior swagger whether in a baseball uniform or in true religions lowrise billy rainbow big t bootcut with back flap pockets with rainbow embroidery old multi big t thread combination standard 9 1 2

8713278 id love to see a point where it is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations

8713284 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8713285 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8713286 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8713287 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8713302 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8713303 they needed a short victorious war and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8713304 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it just sounds not rational
8713305 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8713312 what we would like to see is a return to a place where we can have integration of russia into the international community unfortunately its russia that made the choice to take several steps backward in that regard

8713406 orchestrated the conflict in georgia possibly for domestic election purposes
8713407 american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8713408 suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates presumably mr mccain fighting for the post of us president
8713409 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8713410 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8713411 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal just words we have nothing to fear but fear itself just words just speeches
8713412 i am not asking anybody to take a chance on me im asking you to take a chance on your own aspirations
8713413 im not just asking you to take a chance on me im also asking you to take a chance on your own aspirations
8713414 if there is a child on the south side of chicago who cant read that matters to me even if its not my child
8713415 it is that fundamental belief i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper that makes this country work its what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one american family
8713416 we believe we must be the family of america recognizing that at the heart of the matter we are bound one to another that the problems of a retired school teacher in duluth are our problems that the future of the child in buffalo is our future that the struggle of a disabled man in boston to survive and live decently is our struggle that the hunger of a woman in little rock is our hunger that the failure anywhere to provide what reasonably we might to avoid pain is our failure
8713417 but my grandfather had larger dreams for his son through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place america that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before
8713418 and they too had big dreams for their daughter a common dream born of two continents my parents shared not only an improbable love they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation they imagined me going to the best schools in the land even though they werent rich because in a generous america you dont have to be rich to achieve your potential theyre both passed away now and yet i know that on this night they look down on me with great pride
8713419 i watched a small man with thick calluses on both his hands work 15 and 16 hours a day i saw him once literally bleed from the bottoms of his feet a man who came here uneducated alone unable to speak the language who taught me all i needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence of his example i learned about our kind of democracy from my father and i learned about our obligation to each other from him and from my mother they asked only for a chance to work and to make the world better for their children and they they asked to be protected in those moments when they would not be able to protect themselves this nation and this nations government did that for them
8713420 and that they were able to build a family and live in dignity and see one of their children go from behind their little grocery store in south jamaica on the other side of the tracks where he was born to occupy the highest seat in the greatest state in the greatest nation in the only world we would know is an ineffably beautiful tribute to the democratic process
8713421 we have more work to do more work to do for the workers i met in galesburg illinois who are losing their union jobs at the maytag plant thats moving to mexico and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour more to do for the father that i met who was losing his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay 4 500 dollars a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on more to do for the young woman in east st louis and thousands more like her who has the grades has the drive has the will but doesnt have the money to go to college
8713422 maybe mr president if you visited some more places maybe if you went to appalachia where some people still live in sheds maybe if you went to lackawanna where thousands of unemployed steel workers wonder why we subsidized foreign steel maybe mr president if you stopped in at a shelter in chicago and spoke to the homeless there maybe mr president if you asked a woman who had been denied the help she needed to feed her children because you said you needed the money for a tax break for a millionaire or for a missile we couldnt afford to use
8713423 maybe if john mccain went to pennsylvania and he met the man who lost his job but cant even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one hed understand we cant afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators
8713424 maybe if he went to iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still cant pay the medical bills for his sister whos ill hed understand she cant afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy
8713425 i havent spent most of my life in politics as most of you know but ive spent enough time in washington to know how much we need to change washington

8713645 eu acho que temos que trabalhar com muito carinho sobre o que vamos fazer com o resultado deste petr leo para que o brasil saia ganhando como um todo
8713646 mas para minha surpresa o gil n o era militante do pv coisa nenhuma era grande artista e ambientalista e o pv passou a gostar dele como n s a eu falei o gil n o precisa representar nenhum partido pol tico
8713647 eu acho que de vez em quando as pessoas precisam compreender que o brasil capaz de produzir pessoas t o significativas e t o importantes que elas s o de todos os partidos e ao mesmo tempo n o s o de nenhum imagina se o chico buarque entrasse no meu partido ele certamente ia ficar mais chato imagina se o caetano veloso entra no psdb certamente ia ficar mais chato
8713648 juca voc me ganhou para ser ministro na apresenta o do programa mais cultura no teatro nacional em bras lia sempre achei que quando o gil viajava o minist rio continuava com a mesma energia at nas greves a juca naquela apresenta o voc me convenceu decidi que ia colocar voc no lugar do gil para dar continuidade

8713651 in appearance the wolverine resembles a small bear with a long tail
8713652 i was investigating all sorts of alternative materials aluminum seemed like it could work because of is sound qualities and has been used in instruments in the past like resonator guitars
8713653 after experimenting with different thicknesses it was determined that 032 inch thick aluminum worked best in terms of sound performance and structural integrity it also provided a new and exciting look for the flat top guitar we introduced the alternative x as it was called in 2001 playing off the periodic table symbol for aluminum al and used a 00c thin body design with black hpl for the back and side material
8713654 surprisingly the guitar does not sound thin or tinny but has a nice clean bass response with sparkly highs
8713655 of course it does not sound like spruce but the sound is very pleasing and in my opinion is great for blues
8713656 in the early days we filed for a patent and we were approved
8713657 the thought came to us that by combining both elements we would have a truly unique product we made a few design changes one being the stain color we use on our cherry to a darker richer cherry color that complements the aluminum soundboard this is the first time we used a gloss finish on the aluminum which makes it sparkle like a jewel
8713658 when using a little mic on the blend you get some air which sounds nice moving to all to mic gives a new sound reminiscent of a resophonic guitar

8713665 the christians went to damascus and asked for syrian protection
8713666 why should we give the syrians a pretext to intervene as they did in 1976
8713667 this could happen again with the alawites they feel they are a minority and they know they can be protected

8713677 in science each of us knows that what he has accomplished will be antiquated in ten twenty fifty years
8713678 to take a practical political stand is one thing and to analyze political structures and party positions is another the words one uses in a political meeting are not means of scientific analysis but means of canvassing votes and winning over others they are not plowshares to loosen the soil of contemplative thought they are swords against the enemies such words are weapons it would be an outrage however to use words in this fashion in a lecture or in the classroom
8713679 i am ready to prove from the works of our historians that whenever the man of science introduces his personal value judgment a full understanding of the facts
8713680 i think mez is a potentially good young defenseman who had a bit of an off year this past year and weve asked their camp to entertain that in what were trying to do with him
8713681 i think weve made more than a fair offer and put ourselves in a position where he could come here and with some help we think he can be a top player
8713682 we need their camp to help us in that area as well ive tried to get that message across but to this point we havent gotten there

8713697 could someone please tell roland martin to stop dancing hes upsetting my grandkids
8713698 now that would have really been history i guess he thought it would make him look weak to be taking advice from a woman
8713699 watch c span for convention coverage and get yourself psychically cleared stop watching cable news channels the msm is desperately working to program us morning noon and night and creating despair amongst those who are openly hopeful about 2008 politics is very easy
8713700 you cant make up for four hundred years of oppression in four or eight years
8713701 preliminary epidemiologic and microbiologic results to date support the conclusion that jalapeno peppers were a major vehicle by which the pathogen was transmitted and serrano peppers also were a vehicle tomatoes possibly were a vehicle particularly early in the outbreak
8713702 first neither raw jalapeno nor raw serrano peppers had previously been identified as a vehicle for a salmonella outbreak in the united states
8713703 largest foodborne disease outbreak identified in the united states in the past decade based on the number of culture confirmed cases
8713704 we need congress to give the fda authority for mandatory controls for fresh foods
8713705 we need to develop technologies which will enable us to detect pathogens in fresh produce more quickly
8713706 the point is that not all industry is doing it and there need to be standards
8713707 he wanted to get into the fight wherever and whenever it took him
8713708 only good men like him volunteer to serve and defend their country only good men like him are willing to die for us
8713709 shawn truly believed in making a difference and being an agent of positive change
8713710 we will remember him to the end of our days
8713711 its not a lack of things to say about shawn but because words seem so inadequate for the task
8713712 this is the first weekend for regular season high school and college football games as well as special holiday events planned across the state that will all increase motor vehicle travel
8713713 we also expect more cars on the road considering the price of gasoline which has fallen in recent weeks
8713714 and make sure everyone is buckled up on every trip
8713715 when it launches for the first time into the frigid canadian waters the diefenbreaker as it is almost certain to be nicknamed will be a crowning achievement for our country
8713716 the true north is our destiny for our explorers for our entrepreneurs for our artists and to not embrace its promise now at the dawn of its ascendancy would be to turn our backs on what it is to be canadian
8713717 prime minister harper is no longer a newcomer in the arctic hes got his head around some fundamental inuit issues after making four trips to the arctic so we are now able to talk to him in detail about our issues and more importantly how they are all interconnected
8713718 i can say at least for us in the yukon its quite comforting that we now have a government that actually has a vision for the north
8713719 if mr dion thinks his carbon tax idea is going to help save the environment in the arctic he needs professional assistance
8713720 friends i hope in the not so distant future to return and to see the long dreamed of beaufort mackenzie valley gas development finally come to fruition and to see our northern frontier opened as it has never been before
8713721 if the prime minister was truly concerned with protecting arctic sovereignty his top priority would be addressing the climate crisis and stopping the rapid loss of ice at the poles
8713722 but instead mr harper is allowing emissions to rise and plans to let big oil and gas companies drill in the melting north the arctic is our common heritage and drilling for oil in this fragile environment is unacceptable
8713723 its not something the cardinals would do i dont think
8713724 for attractive lips speak words of kindness for lovely eyes seek out the good in people for a slim figure share your food with the hungry for poise walk with the knowledge that you will never walk alone
8713725 for assuredly i say to you till heaven and earth pass away one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled
8713726 for surely you will not have gone to every village of israel before the son of man returns
8713727 thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart thou shalt in any way rebuke thy neighbour so thou shalt not bear sin on his account and thy hand shall not avenge thee and thou shalt not be angry with the children of thy people and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself i am the lord
8713728 you do something dangerous and stupid if you survive its a story
8713729 it is inherently even before 9 11 a pretty suspicious looking activity slinking around getting into these supposedly secure places dressed up with lights on your head
8713730 we say usually that people represent in the catacombs whats on the surface and i know an explorer who is the head of a big corporation and is very rich and some others are really poor and some are into computers and some are scientists and some are teachers there is a big variety of people
8713731 im not so sure about obama i heard he might be a muslim
8713732 that dress is a little too obamabiden on you mrs
8713733 one of the amazing things about barack obama is that he was not always an adult at one point in his life he was a child a child as our own bela karolyi found out that was much shorter than he is today
8713734 that episode was lousy the writing needs to improve if they want to win the hearts and minds of television viewers
8713735 john mccain has years of political experience and barack obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8713736 theres no way hillary could beat mccain shes too polarizing i think it should be obama
8713737 certainly i am not surprised that saratoga is near the top given the number of cranes up there its been a preferred place to live and will continue to be
8713738 i would expect the trend to come back around to more people living in the urban areas
8713739 the growth is proof positive that we are doing the right things
8713740 if you watch it at 8 00 in the morning in a courtroom it is obscene but watch it on a saturday night with a bunch of your friends over and proper chemical enhancements in place and well then it makes more sense
8713741 regrets to advise its customers that it has suspended operations with effect from 18 00 utc on thursday 28 august

8713750 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8713751 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8713752 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8713753 it is probably the best opportunity weve had in this district in 30 years to retire jim sensenbrenner
8713754 one of the most partisan and polarizing members of congress
8713755 i want people on a broader emotional level to feel good about their leader ship
8713756 we shouldnt have to be embarrassed by the people who represent us we can do better than that
8713757 our challenge is to get people to the polls to capitalize on getting republicans to the polls who are fed up with a party that has completely betrayed the very principles it says it stands for to turn out republicans who are also fed up with representation from people like jim sensenbrenner who are just not capable of working across the aisle plus independents and democrats
8713758 we are counting on democrats to turn out who are also interested in seeing some new leadership
8713759 a primary vote is equal to about 10 votes in the general election
8713760 people can accomplish great things all it takes is a willingness to get out there and be active
8713761 circle their wagons around party leadership instead of circling their wagons around a new generation of leadership
8713762 the war in iraq must be brought to a responsible but rapid conclusion
8713763 prices are going to go up pretty soon you re going to see increases by five 10 15 cents a gallon
8713764 if we have a katrina type event you re talking about gas prices going up another 30 per cent
8713765 i think that s taking some of the steam out of this rally
8713766 if people start cancelling their vacations to the gulf because of the storm we re probably going to have less demand for fuel than anticipated
8713767 wir k nnen die gro en st dte nicht evakuieren
8713768 man sagt dass die araber keine gelegenheit verpassen um eine gelegenheit zu verpassen
8713769 ich muss ihnen sagen dass sie keine gelegenheit verpassen eine gelegenheit zu verpassen
8713770 es gibt zwei punkte wo es keine bereinkunft geben kann
8713771 israel wird nie den tempelberg den pal stinensern oder jemand anderem geben er ist zu heilig f r uns aber wir k nnten die herrschaft gott und den v lker der welt geben wir k nnen ihn nicht aufgeben aber wir k nnten ihn teilen damit wir uns nicht falsch verstehen es gibt kein recht auf r ckkehr nicht f r einen einzigen pal stinenser wenn wir erst die t r ffnen wird israel nicht mehr israel sein
8713772 ich garantiere euch es ist viel sicherer wenn man den feind wenn es einen gibt auf der anderen seite der grenze hat als innerhalb des landes
8713773 wir m ssen tapfer genug sein um in den frieden zu gehen
8713774 es ben tigt tapferkeit um in den krieg zu gehen es ben tigt tapferkeit um in den frieden zu gehen roosevelt sagte es so richtig das einzige was wir f rchten m ssen ist die furcht selbst
8713775 ich wei nicht es ist politisch schon mutig gegen 10 000 fanatische juden vorzugehen sie sind sehr lautstark stark und gewaltt tig man muss in den sauren apfel bei en und es tun
8713776 die pal stinenser wollen ihre eigene heimat wir k nnen keine haben wenn sie keine haben k nnen dann wird es einen punkt geben wo der besatzer zum besetzten wird
8713777 perd n perd n en nombre de la naci n paraguaya
8713778 we are more interested in the process by which one goes about voting not simply getting young people out to vote
8713779 its been really overwhelming in the last week or so and i am honored that people think i am qualified
8713780 i said early on i did not want to be considered and i sent that message i am very supportive of john mccain but my sights are not to stay in washington for the next four years
8713781 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8713782 the clinton family bill hillary and chelsea got stuck in one
8713783 its obviously one of the premier events in the festival world which gives you immense clout and immense opportunities
8713784 yo this is my shit and ive pieced together this bit of work for you
8713785 going back to 1999 john mccain did an interview with the san francisco chronicle saying that overturning roe vs wade would not make any sense because then women would have to have illegal abortions
8713786 roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned
8713787 the reversal of roe v wade represents only one step in the long path toward ending abortion
8713788 a lot of women because they see him as a maverick assume mccain is a moderate
8713789 vielleicht war ich zun chst etwas naiv aber ich dachte pl tzlich der hauch von 1500 jahren katholischer geschichte umgibt mich
8713790 der priester ist im alten ritus nicht so stark herausgehoben so empfinde ich das
8713791 und obwohl dort nur m nner wohnen gibt es keine fu ballmannschaft
8713792 vieles ist heute in den gottesdiensten zwar gut gemeint dennoch ist es geschmacklos und unw rdig
8713793 f r uns war die loyalit t zur kirche die voraussetzung um distanz zum system halten zu k nnen
8713794 diese unterteilung von liberal und konservativ m ssen wir hinter uns lassen
8713795 wer um alles in der welt hindert erzbischof zollitsch daran ein wort der wertsch tzung ber den z libat zu sagen
8713796 it s important for us to see what is out there
8713797 we want to make sure that our standards and practices are the leading edge practices and that we leave no stone unturned to make sure that the propane facilities are very safe to operate in ontario and that the public is safe
8713798 for the public to have confidence in the public safety system the mcguinty government should have been out front on this
8713799 but it s a government that doesn t like to take the blame so they re shirking their responsibilities and i m very disappointed in them
8713800 it is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye
8713801 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8713802 the clinton family bill hillary and chelsea got stuck in one
8713803 i feel good about it being the end now and being able to walk away in one piece
8713804 i just knew that i wanted to stick around the game and be a part of it
8713805 you just work so hard to make the league and then once youre there you have to continue to work hard to stay
8713806 i guess you never know from year to year and game to game how long its going to last
8713807 looking back i feel very fortunate to have played as long as i have
8713808 ive been pretty lucky over the years as far as health wise
8713809 ive got a wife and two kids that are in school and they really enjoy living down here
8713810 weve got lots of friends in the game and out of the game that also plays a big factor when it comes time to make that decision at the end of your career
8713811 stu was a consummate professional on and off the ice throughout his career and was the type of player who always exhibited the qualities you would associate with a future coach
8713812 stu will be an excellent addition to our staff which we feel is among the best in the league
8713813 over the years theyve really tried to go after the stanley cup and been proactive trying to get there
8713814 it seems like we have a real good group now
8713815 oh thats because the principal is very tough and shes just more diligent about reporting these things
8713816 this stop snitchin is going to be the end of us all if we continue to let it run our city
8713817 fear is not an option dont let me see you do it com
8713818 a lot of people think this snitchin theme affects only certain areas
8713819 its not just north phillys problem its not just west phillys problem its everybodys problem no one should dismiss the fact that this is going on
8713820 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded
8713821 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
8713822 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts
8713823 a week without common sense political thought was making me feel lower than a snakes belly in a wagon rut
8713824 dana troglodyte misogynist obsessive a complete loser every time i pick on him no matter how nasty a person he is i feel bad because he is after all a loser
8713825 wireimage has been our guy for the last six or seven events hes been incredible he knows what we are looking for as far as imagery he understands the brand and supports our product its just easier to work with people you already have relationships with
8713826 we usually use the catering the venue provides but if were doing a program at which venue catering is not an option well bring in
8713827 you can always tell a childish spiteful republican by the way he or she refers to the democratic party as the democrat party
8713828 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8713829 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8713830 having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate insolvency administration proceedings
8713831 the volunteers have been deployed to assist the passengers we ve got our food providers helping them out with snacks and stuff to try and make the best of a very challenging situation for them
8713832 there are a number of ground support agencies and services as well as the airport authority that are owed some funds from zoom so the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors

8713860 if a franchisee candidate wants to be more confident that a franchisor will be there to provide its part of the arrangement towards the end of the ten year contract that they are about to sign then they should look for systems that have been in operation for more years systems that are part of businesses that have been in operation for more years and systems with more total outlets

8713872 to develop equipment for potential combat use against ground based ballistic missiles
8713873 russia is saying once again that has the opportunity to overcome us missile defense
8713874 such tests are planned in advance maybe but its unlikely
8713875 experience shows the most economical and quickly achievable countermeasures against the development of a missile defense system are so called asymmetrical measures
8713876 most likely this is an old topol maybe slightly modernized
8713877 these missiles are to be stationed alongside our border and they are a threat to us we have to respond somehow to this situation and naturally enough we have to take a military response
8713878 the storm poses a serious threat to lives and property next week along the gulf coast all interests from the florida panhandle to south texas should closely monitor the storm prepare an emergency plan and stock up on supplies

8713884 everything ive learned in my eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8713885 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8713886 i watched how barack touched people how he inspired them and i realized he had tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8713887 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be president
8713888 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8713891 considering that were challenging an industry that has been assaulting our self esteem for a long time this isnt just a movie opening its a movement its how each and every one of us can say enough the reason i believe a movie about our unhealthy obsession with beauty is important is because it really effects young girls the average girl 8 to 18 years of age doesnt like her body doesnt feel shes attractive and is contemplating dieting or even worse plastic surgery this is very unhealthy because as we all know a healthy self esteem is the engine that makes you assertive confident and ready to take on the world unfortunately this has been taken away from a lot of us so that some beauty companies can sell more products and the ceos of these companies can drive bentleys
8713892 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant
8713893 sparse capacity means that every barrel of oil lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner
8713894 as long as there is a chance that well be in this storm ill be here in louisiana

8713897 if you ask me guns n roses are fucking back and theyll be just fine
8713898 it wasnt quite an accident but it certainly has taken off i work for northeast maritime institute in fairhaven massachusetts and we had started a program where we were trying to work on the man overboard problem where someones on a ship at some point and they fall overboard and they need to stay in contact with the ship many times when someones fallen overboard and theyre recovered they may have passed away in the accident and unfortunately they may have had communications equipment with them a radio or even a cellphone in a pocket none of these traditionally would work so we started tackling the problem and look at ways for individuals to stay in contact with the ship and we developed a transponder that sent gps coordinates but it needed to continue to function once it was in the water ive worked on military and space projects for much of my career and from previous experiences i knew there were some coating methods out there but quite often they involve time to get the coating done and extremely expensive so i started working on a way that i could coat these transponders and came up with the process and it worked all the demos we did in the water the system continued to function i was curious and decided to start coating cell phones and vhf radios and they also worked
8713899 i would really like to work with manufacturers weve been trying to talk with cellphone manufacturers for at least a few months now with varying success the easiest way to do this and the most inexpensive way for the consumer would be if the phone could be coated from the manufacturer

8713916 the findings help accurately identify management measures to reduce the wasteful killing of these magnificent birds while not unnecessarily disrupting fishing activities or impacting other vulnerable marine life like turtles and sharks
8713917 while this information is valuable its crucial that it translates into compliance with mitigation measures on the part of fishing operations
8713918 this has management implications for seabirds because of the dramatic changes in marine ecosystems as a result of past fishing activities
8713919 the possibility exists that management actions could place a further burden on these species
8713920 albatrosses and petrels undertake amazing journeys where many species frequently circumnavigate the globe crossing many national and international jurisdictions as well as coming across numerous fishing fleets from various nations
8713921 the health of our oceans can in many ways be judged by the health of our seabirds only together can we have any hope of saving these birds from extinction and protect our oceans

8713942 he may be an expert in darwinian politics but people perceive a sheer lack of leadership qualities
8713943 nationals policy like labours would permit toll roads only where a free alternative route was available
8713944 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
8713945 we are close to a serious conflict u s and nato preparations on a strategic scale are ongoing in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran
8713946 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8713947 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8713948 in light of the build up of nato naval forces in the black sea our fleet has also taken on the task of monitoring their activities
8713949 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there it turns out it cannot

8713969 implementation of the verdict remains impossible unless the absconding convicts surrender or are caught
8713970 if the supreme court allows such convicts to appeal against the hc verdict then their fate will be decided after its verdict
8713971 faulty investigation is the reason behind damaging the merit of the case
8713972 the io did not investigate many important aspects failed to prove many things including conspiracy behind the assassinations and presented faulty documents
8713973 the high court also made the same observation in recognition to the trial court observation regarding flawed investigation
8713974 the high court thinks the charges have been made not against the right persons
8713975 this is a lame excuse that the investigation officer could not investigate properly
8713976 why didnt the court make any observation regarding delay in trial of such a historic case for 21 years why was no investigation done into it
8713977 i did my investigation properly and pressed charges against those who appeared to be guilty on the basis of evidence available and the court punished those who it felt were guilty i havent seen the court verdict and have nothing to say about it
8713978 although the killings took place in november 1975 the investigation could not be launched until october 1996 for the indemnity ordinance moreover there were attempts to destroy evidence of the case in the long course of time
8713979 we have got justice from the high court in this case and hope the same will happen to other cases as well
8713980 im disappointed with the judgment we will go to the supreme court to appeal against it we have faith in the apex court and we believe well get justice there
8713981 it proves my clients were not involved in the killing
8713982 it is sad and unfortunate family members of the slain leaders as well as the people are frustrated at the verdict
8713983 the verdict has disappointed me and my family members we reject it
8713984 we had earlier rejected the verdict of the trial court we expected justice from the high court but it has also disappointed us
8713985 we wanted justice but it has not been done the verdict has utterly frustrated us
8713986 we are not happy with the verdict but we have to accept the judgement of the highest court
8713987 we are shocked at the verdict if darkness clouds the judiciary justice can not be done
8713988 the national leaders were killed in front of prison guards and all the murderers were identified we are not happy with the verdict
8713989 tarique has secured bail in all the 13 cases filed against him and the high court also stayed the proceedings against him in all these cases so there is no legal bar to his getting released from jail now
8713990 activities under the strategic transport plan have already started to bring order in the city transport sector remove traffic congestions and curb the level of air pollution

8713994 we will also revive the rivers in and around the capital to integrate those with the land transport systems
8713995 it is time to make the capital city habitable by cleansing it of environment pollution and traffic jam
8713996 this government already has taken initiative to further expedite the dhaka transport coordination board and laid special importance on advancing the stp which had been stuck for long
8713997 as a result intolerable traffic jams air and noise pollution and so on became a matter of city life civic amenities have decreased increasing suffering
8713998 we want to be informed about the difficulties the political parties are facing regarding registration

8714014 nicole is your typical 14 year old girl shes no 3 of four daughters and she was diagnosed about a year and a half ago with limb girdle muscular dystrophy and it was a shock to all of us especially nicole
8714015 she was always a toe walker and we never thought much of it because every time wed go to the doctor theyd say shell grow out of it shell grow out of it so we started not even worrying about it
8714016 the muscle breakdown or weakness if you will will eventually land nicole in a wheelchair
8714017 and with mda and the people associated with mda and the contributions we wouldnt be able to focus on just dealing with you know keeping nicole happy and healthy if we didnt have such a wonderful organization behind us
8714018 and i thought it would be a great idea for her to be as involved as possible with the mda and right away it was within a couple of months a few months that mary had asked nicole to be the goodwill ambassador for central massachusetts
8714019 i would love of course i would love to see a cure for this and that would be the ideal but i would love to see her to be able to get through high school and not have to be in a wheelchair

8714055 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8714056 they needed a short victorious war and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8714057 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it just sounds not rational
8714058 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8714059 doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader

8714063 i dont think anyone should be looking for a new cold war
8714064 what we would like to see is the return to the status quo before august 7th and the hostilities began before russia invaded georgia before the disproportional response to the regular flare ups that happen in the summertime out in that area
8714065 what we would like to see is a return to a place where we can have integration of russia into the international community unfortunately its russia that made the choice to take several steps backward in that regard

8714149 recalls can take time and the commission felt that time was of the essence and that warning the public about this product was so important that we could not wait until a recall was announced
8714150 it is now clear what the foreseeable danger with this product is
8714151 the fact that we have put out this warning pretty much has determined that this is a product that should not be used by consumers
8714152 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products sfca maintains that it is not responsible for products previously manufactured by simplicity inc
8714153 all bassinets produced and sold by sfca are produced in this manner with fabric permanently attached over the lower bar and meet or exceed astm standards and cpsc guidelines

8714161 experts many americans lost homes due to a bill championed by biden
8714162 went out of his way to undermine criticism of the legislation
8714163 biden was a fairly strong proponent of that bankruptcy bill
8714164 barack obama and joe biden have real solutions for struggling families in danger of losing their homes because of the bush economy and abusive lending practices
8714165 is directly responsible for the rising foreclosure rate since the end of 2005
8714166 trying to tie the forclosure crisis to the 2005 bankruptcy bill is a stretch
8714167 increased home foreclosures increased the dollar value of financial assets in default and put additional downward price pressure on real estate markets
8714168 estou pensando positivo para que o fabinho se recupere logo mas quero aproveitar a oportunidade para ter uma seq ncia e pegar ritmo de jogo o que n o consegui no ano passado por causa da cirurgia espero que a hist ria agora seja diferente
8714169 temos advers rios qualificados e ainda muitos jogos pela frente estamos com uma seq ncia boa de resultados uma boa vantagem de pontos mas acho que a briga pelas vagas na s rie a ser grande at o final do campeonato
8714170 eu fui contratado para jogar como volante mas se for pra ficar at o final do ano jogando na lateral vou ajudar o grupo e procurar sempre jogar bem tanto no meio como na lateral
8714171 ele conversou comigo eu sou volante de origem mas ele m rcio fernandes j tinha me visto jogar na lateral e ele queria muito naquela partida que eu jogasse como lateral estou aqui contratado para ajudar o santos
8714172 eu vou colocar em ordem por seq ncia estou aqui at o final do ano eu vou pensar em ajudar o time depois veremos o que vai acontecer j que eu fazendo um bom desempenho aqui vai ser bom para o santos e o palmeiras
8714173 sab amos que n o teria como pegar moleza estamos falando dos melhores clubes de futebol do mundo ser dif cil mas entendo que a fiorentina uma das favoritas da chave aposto que nossa equipe vai surpreender na liga e brigar pelo italiano
8714174 a fiorentina montou uma equipe muito forte um time com muitos talentos individuais e que est ganhando entrosamento sei o quanto essa classifica o foi importante para minha carreira mas o objetivo tentar buscar o in dito t tulo a repercuss o aqui em floren a foi grande pelo retorno do time liga
8714175 meu pr ximo sonho tentar fazer com que mais pessoas se envolvam com a nata o e com o esporte

8714179 trabalhei com o celso roth e posso falar que em nenhum momento ele pede para ser desleal em campo ele pede o que todos os treinadores pedem quando o advers rio tiver se aproximando da rea para matar a jogada a falta faz parte do futebol e est comprovado que em muitas vezes o time que faz mais faltas sai vitorioso de campo
8714180 n o estou falando que tem que ser violento pois n o sou a favor da viol ncia em nenhum segmento da sociedade mas uma falta matar a jogada s vezes eu sou a favor
8714181 i sat through i guess id have to call it a service
8714182 people were responding in unison in the middle leah daughtry a pastor and ceo of the democratic national convention committee spoke and said that despite what the media says democrats are people of faith
8714183 i stood up and said im a democrat but im not a person of faith i said this looks like a church service to me and i never thought i would see the democrats doing something like this
8714184 im not a career protester i just dont like religion mixed with politics its wrong and its dangerous

8714190 fiquei feliz quando soube que aar n jogaria em glasgow porque estou sozinho na cidade e teria uma pessoa conhecida para fazer companhia
8714191 disseram nos que era pouco recomend vel sairmos juntos por ruas e bares dias antes e alguns dias depois do derby porque os torcedores n o veriam com bons olhos dois jogadores rivais lado a lado
8714192 a cidade est divida essa semana h um sentimento forte pelos dois clubes e n o existem mais outros times nela somente celtic e rangers por isso apenas conversamos pelo telefone
8714193 outro dia depois de ganharmos por 3 a 0 do falkirk em casa eu e meus companheiros fomos comemorar nosso triunfo e quando cruz vamos com os torcedores eles nos cumprimentavam pelo jogo mas diziam que a partida importante era do pr ximo domingo contra os verdadeiros rivais
8714194 o l o rabelo vai se encontrar hoje noite com o thiago neves para apresentar a proposta a ele e ver se o thiago aceita

8714196 deixei o atl tico em 2004 e depois em 2007 e essa ser a primeira vez que vou enfrent los trata se de um jogo especial pois um clube que eu tenho uma hist ria e aprendi a admirar mas hoje fa o parte da vida do palmeiras e vou fazer de tudo para vencer
8714197 prorrogaram a janela at segunda feira mas n o recebemos nenhuma proposta vamos aguardar mas a princ pio n o chegou nada
8714198 n o sei se m rito ou dem rito mas desta vez foi diferente talvez o dirigente brasileiro esteja mais esperto cobrando mais caro para liberar seus jogadores ou o que n o acredito os europeus n o est o mais t o interessados nos jogadores daqui
8714199 nunca tivemos nada certo com o dod ele tem aquele problema do doping um processo complicado e n o faz parte dos planos um grande jogador de primeira linha e deve ter propostas de fora mas neste momento n o nos interessa

8714204 no one tells me what to do either and im the star
8714205 it was an exhibition game it is what it is youre trying to look at an awful lot of people i was pretty pleased with the way we performed overall first game of the season after 10 days of training its a mixed bag you never know what youre going to get so overall i was quite pleased with the way just about everybody played
8714206 the down side of playing that exhibition game is that you get kind of a false look at things these two games this weekend are going to be battles we have got to understand that what we saw in the exhibition were not going to see friday were going to need some real match focus our set pieces need some work we need to be able to defend well and establish the tone all of the nice passes are great but this team needs to have a practical side to it we have to be able to stop notre dame de namur as well as stanford until we can get things moving a little bit
8714207 i dont think that will be a problem this is the opening game of the season for us it all counts from here on out the stanford game means awfully little if we dont perform well and put in a good result against notre dame de namur i could see this in the middle of the season being a bit of a difficult game for us to prepare for but our guys are ready
8714208 contamos com o nosso torcedor na partida desse s bado tenho certeza de que se eles comparecerem em um bom n mero na vila capanema vamos ser mais fortes ainda para buscar essa vit ria
8714209 a torcida tem que incentivar nossa equipe n s jogadores somos apenas um gr o de areia dentro do paran clube eles n o s o torcedores dos jogadores e sim do clube por isso precisam ir ao est dio torcer pelo time sair dessa situa o na s rie b

8714230 a lot of writers figure out how they are going to get the part they want onto tv they think of a news lead and write around it and if the tv lights dont go on as the speaker is approaching that news lead he skips a few paragraphs and waits until they are lit to read the key part this does not make for a coherent flowing speech
8714231 it means that it will be something that the family would be happy to hear at this point
8714232 were not taking it lightly that i can assure you of
8714233 ive fought many elections and leadership races over the past couple of years and im quite happy to govern

8714235 this parliament is increasingly reaching an impasse on a range of issues
8714236 the other party has tabled an economic agenda that remains diametrically opposed to everything this government stands for

8714245 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8714246 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8714247 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
8714248 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8714249 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world
8714250 iran doesnt pose a serious threat to us the way the way the soviet union did
8714251 john mccain is distorting barack obamas words to cover up for the fact that its the failed bush mccain approach to foreign policy and the bush mccain war in iraq that that have strengthened iran and endangered israel while barack obama recognizes that iran has been the biggest beneficiary of the war in iraq and that the bush mccain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed iran to spin 3800 centrifuges threaten israel and fund terrorism john mccain promises more of the same if john mccain was serious about dealing with the threat from iran he would join barack obamas bipartisan effort in the senate to step up sanctions on iran instead of adopting the same tired old bush rove playbook
8714252 because democrats so divided this country that iran saw weakness
8714253 the bush mccain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed iran to spin 3800 centrifuges threaten israel and fund terrorism john mccain promises more of the same
8714254 ele me disse que iria contar como foram as coisas e no final n o disse nada e isso foi o que me surpreendeu

8714256 currently there are more than 50 000 applications from kerala that are pending for the past five years before the canadian immigration authorities with the canadian government amending their immigration law this june all those who have applied after sep 1 2006 and before feb 27 this year can resubmit their applications for speedy processing at no extra cost
8714257 pumas though are a rare breed to put things into perspective a rally for clinton here yesterday reportedly drew about 1 000 people keep in mind there are about 50 000 here for the convention yes they do exist but in small clustered numbers and by all measures they are an endangered species of voter a march 2008 gallup poll showed that 28 of clinton voters would vote for mccain in the fall now that same poll shows that number standing at just 16 other polls have the number in closer to 20
8714258 from the elaborate stagecraft to the teeming crowd of 80 000 cheering partisans the vagaries of the weather to the unpredictable audience reaction the optics surrounding the stadium event have heightened worries that the obama campaign is engaging in a high risk endeavor in an uncontrollable environment
8714259 there is an obvious tension between these two vital objectives clintons core supporters are liberal feminists while independent voters tend toward political moderation

8714348 yielding insights into the processes and mechanisms involved in making a dead star so active
8714349 the high degree and direction of polarization at high energies reported by dean et al provide valuable information on the site of acceleration of the particles and on the structure of the magnetic field associated with the pulsar
8714350 this is the brightest object in the gamma ray sky the one we have the most data for

8714365 i was actually the entertainment chair for eventworld so i got to work with committee to plan the three days served as entertainment sponsor for the opening session and esprit awards gala and was there as an attendee so i was really involved from all sides overall i thought it was very well coordinated by event staff and the vinoy and extremely well attended despite the tropical storm and travel issues
8714366 eventworld is about bring everyone together from around the world and giving them a chance to network and have educational offerings and from that standpoint it was a success education sessions were very broad based and offered something for everyone and there was a lot of excitement over the disney trip we really had good attendance
8714367 it was my first one so i was really excited to be there and actually posted a blog about it i knew that id be seeing some people i hadnt seen in a while and got some great networking out of it it definitely lived up to what i expected in that id heard it was a more intimate conference had a bit more focus and people on a more level playing field plus the search event was phenomenal

8714371 prices are going to go up pretty soon you re going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon

8714385 every game is a big game but thursday is a big chance for us to showcase nationally what we certainly hope to be about as a football program

8714390 i think being on both ends of the spectrum has really helped us stay grounded we know that we cant let that stuff get to us
8714391 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8714392 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08

8714559 why are we on the borders of russia provoking the russians i mean the georgians initiated the military attack against these enclaves where there were mostly russians its the fact that were over there that we create these crises

8714608 regarding the first quarter we made the decision to protect our market share in our vga business during a time of product transition which had a negative impact on our gross margins

8714610 we had another quarter of strong product revenue growth and expanding operating margins
8714611 our transformation of the company positions us well to focus on sustained growth in 2009

8714629 nosso grupo tem equipes muito fortes e com certeza ser um dos mais equilibrados da competi o mas nosso time est preparado e acho que podemos chegar longe
8714630 o porto uma excelente equipe tem bons jogadores como o quaresma e joga muito bem principalmente dentro de casa
8714631 o fenerbahce j chegou longe no ano passado e tem v rios bons jogadores como o alex o david e o lugano e o d namo uma equipe de muita for a e velocidade e se torna um advers rio dif cil jogando em casa
8714632 a bola vem chegando mas que a gente n o est acertando o p mesmo
8714633 a bola vem chegando mas que a gente n o est acertando o p mesmo na partida contra o vit ria tivemos algumas oportunidades claras de gol e n o fizemos temos que trabalhar a cabe a para quando chegar na hora em frente ao gol ter a consci ncia de fazer
8714634 est faltando um pouco de sorte estamos chutando mas a bola desvia e n o entra eles tiram em cima da linha
8714635 sabemos que vai ser dif cil contra o inter no beira rio e contra o palmeiras no parque ant rtica n s tamb m sab amos da dificuldade que seria mas conseguimos arrancar os pontos
8714636 estou pensando positivo para que o fabinho se recupere logo mas quero aproveitar a oportunidade para ter uma seq ncia e pegar ritmo de jogo o que n o consegui no ano passado por causa da cirurgia espero que a hist ria agora seja diferente
8714637 o nosso plantel grande tem qualidade e todos lutam para conquistar seu espa o comigo n o vai ser diferente espero entrar bem e ajudar o grupo a voltar s rie a
8714638 este chute pode ser uma arma secreta para surpreender o goleiro e sempre estou aprimorando para acertar de novo
8714639 outro ngulo que pode ser analisado que os jogadores agora ter o um tempo maior de treinamento no intervalo de um jogo para outro se pass ssemos talvez seria imposs vel de trabalhar
8714640 sab amos que n o teria como pegar moleza estamos falando dos melhores clubes de futebol do mundo ser dif cil mas entendo que a fiorentina uma das favoritas da chave aposto que nossa equipe vai surpreender na liga e brigar pelo italiano
8714641 a fiorentina montou uma equipe muito forte um time com muitos talentos individuais e que est ganhando entrosamento sei o quanto essa classifica o foi importante para minha carreira mas o objetivo tentar buscar o in dito t tulo a repercuss o aqui em floren a foi grande pelo retorno do time liga
8714642 estou me sentindo muito bem e isso muito importante para a seq ncia do campeonato os treinamentos me animaram e at tive que segurar um pouco os jogadores pois eles est o com muita vontade de mostrar trabalho
8714643 n o adianta os jogadores serem bonzinhos no jogo e treinarem para depois deixarem acontecer igual ao jogo do palmeiras a equipe do palmeiras com todo o respeito est na segunda coloca o tem n vel bem parecido com o nosso
8714644 n o uma situa o f cil complicado porque a portuguesa ocupa as ltimas posi es da tabela mas temos 45 pontos a disputar o primeiro motivo que me fez aceitar o desafio foi que eu acredito muito no elenco que simples e com qualidade em cima disso eu acho que algumas coisas t m que ser feitas com muita conversa treinamento e trabalho

8714658 it is on all my believing disciples that i build my church to all my disciples i give the power to bind or to loose
8714659 i say to you whatever you bind on earth heaven will keep bound whatever you unbind on earth heaven will keep unbound
8714660 sexual abuse of minors by a significant number of priests and religious together with the attempts by many church authorities to conceal the abuse constitute one of the ugliest stories ever to emerge from the catholic church
8714661 this book is not directly about that abuse but about a better church these revelations absolutely demand a better church a church more conformed to the real spirit and teaching of jesus a church that needs to be reformed to become a better church
8714662 those years left an indelible mark on me though they led me to a sense of profound disillusionment with many things within my church typified by the manner in which i was convinced that a number of people at every level were seeming to manage the problem and make it go away rather than truly confront and eradicate it
8714663 through all this i came to the unshakeable conviction that within the catholic church there absolutely must be profound and enduring change
8714664 but the second is that within the catholic church there is a constant insistence that on all important matters catholic people must look to the pope for guidance and direction we think of the pope who has full authority over the whole church and we wait for the pope to act before we do what is necessary
8714665 when a major matter arises there is a notable and extraordinary absence of guidance or direction from the pope as was certainly the case in relation to the sexual abuse of minors
8714666 within the present structures of the catholic church it is the pope alone who has the power to make the changes that are necessary
8714667 you are the church all of you share responsibility all of you have power to make the changes
8714668 you are the christ the son of the living god
8714669 look the son of man i am going up to jerusalem where i will be handed over to my enemies ill be tortured and executed crucified
8714670 you are the christ the son of the living god
8714671 no you cant let that happen you dont have to let that happen you have crowds following you you have power you can fight against them you could be victorious through that power
8714672 get behind me you satan youre a stumbling block because
8714673 you are thinking according to human ways not according to the way of god
8714674 have this mind in you which was also in christ jesus
8714675 for though he was god did not think being god was something to be clung to but emptied himself took on the form of a slave became helpless but trusted totally in god so that same one is raised up by god
8714676 i will build my church on you and on your faith
8714677 i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime

8714784 btm when are you going to write this post about the razor blade sandwiches
8714785 i dont like sandwiches i think its a bad recipe you take some boring ingredients you put bread around it and you call it a meal im not interested you know what i think i think sandwiches can go to hell that is exactly what i think about sandwiches

8714794 skyrocketing health care costs are crippling small businesses and bankrupting families mainers are struggling to pay their home heating oil bills this winter the bush economic policies have undermined the promise of america that here everyone has a reasonable chance to get ahead in life
8714795 we can and we must elect a stronger democratic majority to the senate to overcome the obstructionism that threatens barack obamas agenda
8714796 well solve our energy crisis provide affordable quality health care to all americans and bring our troops home from iraq so we can address problems here at home

8714798 maine is a state that is becoming bluer and bluer
8714799 maine is a middle class small business state that is not well served by the policies of the bush administration
8714800 if he lives to be 92 charlie will see the dawn of the 22nd century what kind of country are we building for him and for your children and grandchildren
8714801 to meet our moral responsibility to them we need bold leadership for change in washington

8714805 just to kind of serenade the ladies a little bit with the piano see how that goes
8714806 we can and we must elect a stronger democratic majority to the senate to overcome the obstructionism that threatens barack obamas agenda

8714826 la nuova stagione europea per club nasce sulla scia di unedizione dei campionati europei uefa che si rivelata un grande successo ed stata caratterizzata dal rispetto e dal fair play dentro e fuori dal campo
8714827 negli ultimi anni la uefa ha deciso di ampliare il concetto fair play ha spiegato il signor taylor a uefa com subito dopo il sorteggio il rispetto nel calcio ha molteplici destinatari gli avversari il regolamento i tifosi e pi in generale viene inteso dalla uefa e dal suo staff come un valore fondante su cui si basa ogni tipo di rapporto
8714828 stiamo studiando numerose iniziative per dare visibilit a questa campagna ha proseguito il segretario generale abbiamo cominciato prima dellinizio della rassegna continentale e sembra che il nostro messaggio sia stato colto nel corso di uefa euro 2008 le simulazioni le contestazioni e le critiche nei confronti degli arbitri sono sensibilmente diminuite rispetto al passato e mi auguro che questo possa accadere presto anche nelle competizioni per club per ottenere un simile risultato occorre la collaborazione di tutti tifosi giocatori allenatori e ufficiali di gara

8714845 were very encouraged by the progress weve made over the past fiscal year
8714846 weve achieved significant bookings and backlog growth which positions us well as we enter fiscal 2009 to execute on the second year of our three year plan to achieve a profitable operating structure with our new products and services weve seen acceptance of our solutions across all targeted technical and commercial environments
8714847 we are pleased with bookings performance year over year as a leading indicator of the markets acceptance of our solutions
8714848 our fiscal 2008 financial goals were to generate double digit bookings growth stabilize revenue and manage cash and expenses we largely achieved these goals particularly through the growth in our core products bookings although the timing of customer acceptances did impact revenue for the year
8714849 these new products have allowed us to capture some of the worlds most coveted hpc wins while placing us in new accounts like a major online trading community
8714850 developments like these give us great confidence about the validity of our strategy and direction
8714851 i look forward to continuing to work closely with management and my fellow board members
8714852 i am pleased to have worked with the company during this transition and i have confidence in bo and tony in leading sgi forward

8714854 i would like to express sgis appreciation and thanks to both kevin and chun

8714864 there are no easy games you just take it as it comes we are just delighted to be in it

8714871 the large crowd that we expect is indicative of the campaign that senator obama has run from the beginning change happens from the bottom up
8714872 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8714873 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8714874 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need

8715047 te voy a poner el dedo si contin as en tus trabajos como repartidor de libros

8715049 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8715050 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8715051 the board does not believe the dseis is adequate because it does not fully evaluate the impacts to the presidios national historic landmark district
8715052 the board concludes that the proposed art museum is not a minimal change and would not be compatible with the massing size scale and architectural features of the historic main post buildings and would therefore violate the secretary of the interiors standards
8715053 the presidio historical association shares many concerns expressed in the san francisco landmarks preservation advisory boards letter
8715054 thank her in advance for bringing the m peach to the table

8715059 he is believed to have been snatching bags for four to five years
8715060 our investigators had been calling him the chameleon as he changed clothes or wore camouflage outfits to merge into the background
8715061 by the time we radioed in that the culprit was wearing black clothes he was wearing white or red
8715062 he has an innate ability to translate complex information into an understandable form
8715063 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden on to hard pressed british families and businesses
8715064 its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8715065 the taxpayers alliance figures are seriously flawed because they are based on a discredited approach to calculating the cost of climate change and in fact green taxes have fallen as a proportion of overall taxes since labour came to power
8715066 green taxes are one of the key policies needed to prevent dangerous climate change that would cost the uk billions of pounds and ruin lives
8715067 tax should be about trying to change behaviour and not just about abstract revenue raising
8715068 its the governments fault that people have lost faith in green taxes their money goes into a black hole and they dont see the benefits
8715069 greens would bring in measures like making free insulation available to everyone which would dramatically reduce fuel bills for families and reduce the amount they pay in green taxes as well

8715075 we were on an operation in beit awwa to arrest some wanted men and had reached a darkened basement when we found two naked human beings
8715076 the place stunk like a stable and the ground was covered with hay
8715077 they shouted saying that if we go near the place their son bassam would cut us to pieces we later learned that he is mentally disabled
8715078 they are mentally disabled but we are taking very good care of them the police are lying
8715079 my husband was married to his maternal cousin and they had seven children five of them were born with various types of handicaps and have all passed away only nawal and bassam were left and we could not place them in any institution

8715090 we will make of these detainees parasites in their societies and we will not release them until they become like mummies empty and full of holes from inside like swiss cheese
8715091 i was shackled in iron cuffs that entered my flesh and a bag was put on my head as a certain music roared in my ears and almost deafened me they used to beat me up and kick me and my body was full of wounds and bruises after that i was sent to a doctor who asked me if i was tortured and i said yes but he didnt reply or say something then i was taken back and tortured again
8715092 the use of certain interrogation methods by the israel security agency isa involving the use of moderate physical pressure was illegal as it violated constitutional protection of the individuals right of dignity while recognizing the right of israel to protect its citizens from violence it reiterates that no exceptional circumstances may be invoked as justification of torture
8715093 the use of torture in israeli interrogations and works for its complete prohibition
8715094 how common is the phenomenon of beating shackled palestinian prisoners
8715095 unfortunately i want to admit something that we are not fully aware of these cases are not all that exceptional in their quantity to my great regret many of them are not the subject of any complaint and are cloaked in various kinds of conspiracies of silence
8715096 moral legal and practical gravity to publicize it to examine how those responsible address it to clarify its absolute prohibition under israeli and international law and to demand
8715097 by providing the relevant bodies with useful information and tools
8715098 only metal devices are to be used and the tightening of the shackles should be undertaken to prevent injury to the detainee particularly to blood vessels
8715099 i was put in a small room and they beat my legs they put me on the floor then i felt one of the soldiers take something from the floor and beat me on my head and shoulders then they took me out into a concrete yard and tied my handcuffs to a concrete pole and made me sit on the ground and they beat me every hour or half hour they would beat me on the face

8715103 grave consequences of this action can be anticipated in advance
8715104 how can it be that these events keep repeating themselves and no one is bothered and this is the morality of the idf these are the most basic values to which soldiers should be educated from the start it isnt about palestinians its about normative behavior the most basic things how a soldier in the idf can commit such abusive acts it comes down to some kind of disregard for the lives of palestinians
8715105 criminal phenomenon subject to penalties under an entire system of offenses in israeli criminal law
8715106 given this reality it is hardly surprising that an examination of the actual behavior of the military as distinct from its declarations also reveals denial evasion and obfuscation
8715107 when you deny thousands of people a day free movement it is impossible to do it in a nice way
8715108 tangible objectives for securing a drastic reduction in as short a period of time as possible toward the ultimate goal of completely eradicating this phenomenon
8715109 coalition of israeli palestinian and international ngos united against the practice of torture and ill treatment in israel and the occupied palestinian territories opt

8715114 if there is something all humanity can agree on at least theoretically it is that preserving individual dignity in difficult situations requires that we all conform to some elementary common standards of conduct
8715115 there shall be no violation of the life body or dignity of any person all persons are entitled to protection
8715116 there shall be no deprivation or restriction of the liberty of a person by imprisonment arrest extradition or otherwise
8715117 israeli law has abolished the death penalty for murder and corporal punishment
8715118 fundamental human rights founded upon recognition of the value of the human being the sanctity of human life and the principle that all persons are free
8715119 to protect human life dignity and assure that all government authorities are bound to respect these rights under this basic law
8715120 officially proclaimed a state of public emergency from 19 may 1948 four days after its founding until the present day
8715121 due to the ongoing state of war or violent conflict between israel and its neighbours and the attendant attacks on the lives and property of its citizens
8715122 from torture and other forms of ill treatment or punishment may not be violated under any circumstances and states of emergency
8715123 in the context of the arrest and interrogation of persons suspected of being security threats
8715124 israels sensitivity in dealing with human rights issues and the problem of torture and ill treatment makes any dialogue on these matter particularly slow and complex
8715125 may become overly reluctant to raise such issues systematically consistently and firmly notwithstanding their legal and political duty to put human rights in the centre of their foreign and security policy
8715126 apparently not the subject of torture and ill treatment given the political realities in israel and the opt progress in preventing and eradicating torture and ill treatment must be regarded as a mid and long term goal
8715127 there is never a good moment to raise human rights questions and always a reason for not doing something

8715166 hi jeffrey thanks for your post i would like to make a comment about the example code that grants all privileges to the user ocsg40 this is not a good tip nowadays granting all privileges is actually slightly worse than granting dba as these privileges are not turned off in definer rights code they are always on also even sys does not have all privileges in 11g anymore as it has lost exempt access policy and exempt identity policy i always recommend that the minimum privileges necessary are granted for each role and user and these must be designed for purpose cheers pete
8715167 in the past blacks were seen as ignorant or dangerous that today a black man is seen as to good for people is a huge step forward
8715168 i never thought id see the day when an old white millionaire is viewed as having more in common with working folk than a black man

8715227 we have identified some issues as a result of recent system tests which we are working urgently to address
8715228 i have therefore taken a decision today to postpone deployment until january 2009 to allow sufficient time to continue to test the system
8715229 we repeatedly warned the government of the problems with contactpoint but they pressed ahead regardless ignoring our calls to allow time to sort them out
8715230 there were clear indications in february of significant security concerns with this database only now with just weeks to go until the project is supposed to go live have they finally agreed to pull back to try to iron out some of the problems ministers now need to come clean and confirm whether this delay is because childrens personal information is at risk
8715231 instead of delaying the launch of the database this intrusive project must be scrapped altogether
8715232 a recent independent review has already undermined all of the governments assurances that the database will be secure the discovery of further technical issues does not bode well for the future
8715233 the national galleries of scotland has been given a significant funding pledge from scottish ministers around which to build its fundraising campaign a precise figure will be confirmed in due course
8715234 its important this is done in partnership with the uk government
8715235 its perfectly reasonable to expect that the uk government which has significantly greater financial powers will play ball and donate at least the same level as the scottish government
8715236 but it is far too early to say what contribution if any the uk government will be able to make
8715237 dcms will be talking to the treasury over the next few weeks about issues arising from this case but we are very aware that the culture sector has now received three generous settlements in a row from successive spending rounds and that there is no pot of gold that can be drawn on
8715238 whilst we cant guarantee pubic funds at this stage i fully support the campaign to raise the money to keep it in this country and to allow it to go on show in london for the first time
8715239 we cannot yet say how that might translate into actual figures but the first minister appreciates the cultural value of these works of art and also their value for tourism and the prestige of national collections
8715240 it would be very hard to do this without some concrete contribution from the westminster government
8715241 there was no unanimous support to respond positively to these requests now
8715242 the council will continue to discuss the participation of south ossetia and abkhazia and will intensify these discussions at a more opportune moment
8715243 target all the political leaders especially tony blair and gordan brown sic
8715244 all embassies crusaders centers and their interests through out the country
8715245 i think it is long past time that we all shut up stop making public statements about private disputes and get on with the job we are paid to do
8715246 clearly he chose not to do so that is a matter for him to reconcile with what he considers to be his proper responsibilities as one of this countrys most senior police officers
8715247 in doing so he and all other senior colleagues and i include myself in that need to remember what we are being paid to do and that is to enjoy the privilege of leading committed and professional colleagues in protecting the public that we all serve
8715248 our job is to work for the safety and security of people here in london so that they can enjoy their rights
8715249 it is their rights that need to be at the forefront of all our minds we need to ensure that internal disputes and personal issues do not detract us from this overwhelmingly important mission
8715250 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8715251 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics
8715252 finally it is to do with the victimisation i have suffered since my grievances leaked to the media
8715253 im content with my achievements so far im not seeking massive monetary benefits and i do not have grievances against the whole of the met an organisation that i dearly love and admire
8715254 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8715255 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even as late as today we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8715256 the collapse of zoom is a result of matter beyond our control only last year zoom airlines made profit but that turned into a loss in the last year due to the unprecedented increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate
8715257 the price of oil resulted in our fuel bill jumping by nearly 50 million in one year and we could not recover that from passengers who had already booked their flights
8715258 when youre watching at home you think i can do that until you find yourself in a studio and you realise you cant do it at all
8715259 im scared of doing the foxtrot and the quickstep because its so graceful and im so not
8715260 i spoke to them about it and both of them said its going to be the best time of your life
8715261 everybody whos ever done it has said the same thing so here we are
8715262 but apart from that i havent really done any dancing
8715263 hes told me to glide and not to take any notice of anybody
8715264 i nod a lot and tap my foot at parties i had no idea how technical this would be
8715265 a dance routine in a pop band is very different from this kind of dancing
8715266 i feel the pressure so much but i think ive just got to remember that the only pressure we have is the pressure we put on ourselves so i just want to have fun
8715267 but forget it my thighs are aching so much and ive got blisters all over my feet
8715268 my feet are in bits im going to have really gnarly feet afterwards and ive got wicked bruises and bumps
8715269 its not bitchy at all backstage its actually very friendly
8715270 we all get on were all training and get tired and we keep encouraging each other
8715271 most of us have known each other professionally since we were youngsters
8715272 weve all competed against each other for years and years so we all know each other inside out it just doesnt exist
8715273 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8715274 despite the increases weve seen in nhs budgets the difference in life expectancy between the rich and poor in the country is as wide as it was in victorian times
8715275 with the credit crunch situation there will presumably be less jobs available in the general population and it is yet to be seen what effect this will have on more deprived areas
8715276 the programmes we have are well designed and are being implemented at a reasonable pace but when you look at them you dont see as much input from public health and education programmes
8715277 they will be very very pleased that they dont have to travel far
8715278 i think they will be delighted that theyve not got a lot of travelling to do
8715279 villarreal will not bring up any surprises for them aalborg is the team they will have to be careful of and they will come back to bite you if you disrespect them
8715280 against villarreal i know its a very tough game but people will be looking at the aalborg game and be thinking theres six points for you but i can guarantee that will not be the case for any of the teams facing aalborg
8715281 it will not be an easy six points to pick up so they will be very pleased they dont have to travel but it could have been a lot tougher but how can you say that when youre playing against manchester united and villarreal
8715282 well celtic have already beaten them and they were very unlucky in the first game as well when they played down in manchester the first time they met
8715283 it will be like a home game for them and they will have a big support and manchester united are everybodys favourite not just for the group but probably for the tournament again and rightly so

8715287 the reefs of the world are at risk and hawaiis isolated reefs are especially vulnerable to stresses of any kind particularly to the rapidly emerging stress brought on by climate change
8715288 ocean acidification is creeping progressive and insidious likened by one workshop participant to osteoporosis of the reef a weakening of the reef structure that makes corals more vulnerable to breakage from waves and human use
8715289 because it is difficult to detect unlike mass coral bleaching we dont know whether we have reached or surpassed the critical thresholds for any coral species such as we have for temperature thresholds
8715290 coral reefs are the lifeblood of our oceans and we depend on them for survival
8715291 without urgent action to limit carbon dioxide emissions and improve management of marine protected areas even vast treasured reefs like the great barrier reef and northwestern hawaiian islands will become wastelands of dead coral
8715292 the honolulu declaration offers tangible and practical steps we can take now to prevent further ocean acidification and ensure the survival of our vitally important and irreplaceable rainforests of the sea
8715293 we could see a doubling of atmospheric co2 in a little as 50 years and ocean acidification will continue to an extent and at rates that have not occurred for tens of millions of years
8715294 it is clear that seawater chemistry will change in coming decades and centuries in ways that will dramatically alter marine life
8715295 we are only beginning to understand the complex interactions between large scale chemistry changes and marine ecology it is vital to develop research strategies to better understand the long term vulnerabilities of sensitive marine organisms to these changes
8715296 is leading to the most dramatic changes in marine chemistry in at least the past 650 000 years
8715297 while the consequences of inaction are too depressing to contemplate there is good news
8715298 our workshop showed that there are some practical steps we can take to buy time for coral reefs while co2 levels are stabilized that there is hope for coral reefs if we act now

8715311 it is possible resources will be spent on care that does not improve patients health as effectively
8715312 personal health budgets are likely to work for patients with fairly stable and predictable conditions well placed to make informed choices about their treatment for example some of those in receipt of continuing care or with long term conditions
8715313 nhs resources will be put to good use with appropriate accountability
8715314 no one will ever be denied treatment as a result of having a personal budget

8715351 police will allege the woman was greeted by a 74 year old man who entered the home and then assaulted the woman with a weapon before proceeding to the bathroom and assaulting the wheelchair bound man

8715353 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8715354 they needed a short victorious war and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8715355 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it just sounds not rational
8715356 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8715361 i dont think anyone should be looking for a new cold war
8715362 what we would like to see is the return to the status quo before august 7th and the hostilities began before russia invaded georgia before the disproportional response to the regular flare ups that happen in the summertime out in that area
8715363 what we would like to see is a return to a place where we can have integration of russia into the international community unfortunately its russia that made the choice to take several steps backward in that regard

8715582 social work has been taught at mongolian universities for 10 years or so but still represents something very new and unusual and it is missing its identity and own literature
8715583 the dormitories are in horrifying shape with rooms that must have only six square meters and there are four to five people living there sharing one table
8715584 we currently have 30 students with internships and we are hoping to extend this number
8715585 the amount should cover the wage cost of an employee who is guiding our student
8715586 we are trying to create a background for literature related to social work written by local experts in mongolian because so far they just have to use foreign literature

8715720 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way

8715757 the files on napster were something like 95 or 98 percent unauthorized copyright material that was illegally posted to the site there copyright owners in that case demonstrated that napster and grokster were both well aware of the piracy on their site there was no evidence that this was the case at veoh
8715758 youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners google and youtube have engaged in massive copyright infringement

8715872 the life of an agent differs very much from what you see in films and television
8715873 the cubans were good students i shared my experience with them to help them fight against what at the time was our common enemy the u s secret services
8715874 they would listen with attention and they learned what we had to teach furthermore they tailored what they had learned to the needs of their country and they achieved excellent results in the fight against the enemy
8715875 you teach them how to analyze the events and the actions of the enemy we also shared information that we had about the enemy
8715876 they become so professional that they organized operations that were able to neutralize american military operations against the cuban government the cubans counted 34 times that the americans had tried to kill castro
8715877 during the festival i sat next to him on the podium when the representative from vietnam took the floor castro took notes when his turn to speak arrived he took off his bulletproof jacket put his notebook aside and started to speak he wore only a t shirt his long speech was held under the hot caribbean sun but people listened like they were hypnotized they would not leave
8715878 besides agee there were cuban double agents who pretended to work for the americans
8715879 they did an excellent job one of them showed us a watch that he got from henry kissinger for his good fight against castro
8715880 it was a really tough time for the kgb residents in mexico we were in the center of the united states moscow cuba triangle since mexico was the only channel between cuba and the rest of the world there were two flights a week to and from cuba
8715881 it was the hardest time of the cold war a nuclear conflict could have begun everyone was relieved when it was over
8715882 oswald behaved in a very strange way during his visit to the embassy he took a revolver out and said he was ready to use it if anyone tried to make an attempt on his life
8715883 he didnt threaten anyone but we had the impression that he was an unstable person neurotic but not crazy
8715884 for years i gathered information about oswald and i wrote the book after perestroika
8715885 i said in my speech that i never would have dreamed of sitting next to such people just 10 years earlier
8715886 portrait of a cold warrior second thoughts of a top cia agent
8715887 i was presented as an agent who picked students to study in moscow where they trained as extremists the idea was that these students would then return home and organize socialist revolutionary movements
8715888 i traveled to countries where an agent was needed sometimes i needed to change my appearance and passport i worked with the secret services of friendly countries and took part in different operations organized by our services
8715889 while the person is growing there is a fight among some genes to dominate others
8715890 they didnt go somewhere alone they didnt hide they discussed the forthcoming wedding right here at a table near the bar
8715891 development program of st petersburg as a tourist center from 2005 2010
8715892 we think that st petersburg as the city which is known as the cultural capital of russia and europe deserves to have a quality informational publication that is not only attractive and easy to use but also includes a large database of the tourism market
8715893 we try to make our publication of a high standard although the process of making it perfect can be endless i believe our travel directory can significantly contribute to the improvement of the citys image help to attract more tourists to st petersburg and prove useful for those wishing to visit the city it can be seen as a kind of contribution to the 5 5 5 program
8715894 it is obvious that there are very rich and world famous museums that just dont need more advertising however there are still plenty of small but very interesting museums that should also stay open and can manage to survive with enough publicity
8715895 many museums just dont have quality photos and we are often asked to take or find photos ourselves
8715896 the red prince the secret lives of a habsburg archduke
8715897 wilhelm had lost the easy assurance that time was an eternity of royal blue or at least a green maturation to power or a bloody red march to victory he had learned to think instrumentally and had become an instrument his only success was to strengthen the white politics of the moment a european counterrevolution that was already turning brown at the edges
8715898 nazis seemed like the only possible ally of ukraine and the only force that might once again propel wilhelm toward a throne
8715899 wilhelm a man of royal birth and aspirations decided to support the rule of the people he endorsed the austrian republic after a career as a monarchist accepted the austrian nation after a lifetime of believing in empire and even joined the peoples party after years of bemoaning democracy as a front for soviet conspiracy
8715900 the city of his dreams wearing a blindfold instead of a crown borne to a dungeon rather than a throne
8715901 i thought i was veering away from the world of indie pop to do essentially an art project instead the mainstream press is embracing it
8715902 it has an intense kind of intimacy and immediacy because the music is so raw and heartfelt personally i think it is difficult not to become interested in yankas music once youve heard it and her life which was in equal measures heroic and tragic gives the listener all the more reason to pay attention
8715903 in some cases i added very little singing the songs live and solo as yanka did but many of the songs have been slowed down or sped up and fleshed out with lush arrangements and instrumentation that includes trumpet cello bajo sexto and electric 12 string guitar
8715904 i felt it would be wrong or simply cowardly to avoid the criticism of those who best understand yankas music and the context in which it was made
8715905 there are obviously many yanka fans who feel that to touch her songs is practically blasphemous
8715906 there are also russians who are unhappy about my singing yankas songs with my american accent but being who i am i could never satisfy these listeners i think some dissent and friction is actually a good thing art should be a conversation starter not a conversation stopper
8715907 it has only helped attract interest even in very unlikely places
8715908 howard wolfson chief strategist for hillary clintons presidential campaign wrote to me to personally order a copy of my solo demo versions of the yanka cover album
8715909 it is drastically different from both the yanka album and my previous work featuring brazilian drumming cuban style trumpet vocal loops and more ambitious arrangements
8715910 it was a really tough one and i am completely out of breath
8715911 i struggled out there and my opponent played really really well and pushed me to the limit
8715912 i am not yet at my full potential i still have a long way to go to be where i want to be
8715913 today i played much better than my first match so its looking good for me
8715914 definitely im not in my best shape now and i havent been playing well before the u s open but grand slams keep me much more motivated and i do much more better in grand slams
8715915 its going to be good in two days im sure i was thinking more of it than i was actually feeling the pain so its not really a big deal
8715916 in that certain moment i felt big pain so i just had to tape the ankle but its going to be all right
8715917 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8715918 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8715919 where political discussions fail music can take over and allow people to meet and forge friendships through the love for music that they share
8715920 it is great to see the baltic sea festival gaining an increasingly high profile regarding its actual social commitment
8715921 daniel barenboim and his west eastern divan orchestra are a good example of cultural collaboration in a complicated situation much has improved for those of us who live around the baltic but there are still political tensions so you can see the divan orchestra as a model of how to work together
8715922 the middle east conflict is first and foremost a human conflict rather than a political conflict as at the heart of it lies a fight between different peoples for the right to live on a certain territory
8715923 the baltic sea is the worlds largest brackish sea and a unique ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to pollution
8715924 it is therefore particularly important that we create an overall perspective something that at present is unfortunately lacking
8715925 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8715926 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8715927 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8715928 nobody knows i kind of left it on the table when to have it not even doctors can tell me that
8715929 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8715930 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8715931 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8715932 the court has given me a sword but i wont use violence
8715933 i want the world to watch the situation and judge what is going on here
8715934 the peoples alliance always held on to their rights according to the constitution using it as a shield to protect them but now they have broken their own shield
8715935 protest leaders are now using kids women the elderly and monks as human shields
8715936 there are many people who are not aware that what they are doing is illegal and they will be brought to justice
8715937 if they use force to arrest us there would be a problem
8715938 sondhi is not a viable alternative and really never has been a political alternative at all
8715939 much less democratic parliamentary structure and a return to military influence
8715940 face difficult policy choices in reconciling the countrys russian and western interests particularly with regard to the bosporus and black sea ian lesser a senior fellow at the washington based german marshall fund said in an e mailed note
8715941 the only thing left unchanged will be the old romantic story
8715942 theres no glamour the scenery and costumes look old like beloved old toys from childhood
8715943 a sort of response to the tendency of the virtualization of contemporary life
8715944 rising tensions with the west are giving investors the jitters and theyve been pulling their money from russia
8715945 local ruble traders pay close attention to the dollar euro rate and then adjust their dollar bids against the ruble accordingly
8715946 but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy that has defined his party for more than 25 years
8715947 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
8715948 i watched how barack touched people how he inspired them and i realized he had tapped into the oldest belief in america we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear
8715949 we come to a place in history that i never really thought i would see
8715950 it really is a fulfillment of a dream of dr kings prediction that we would get to the mountaintop
8715951 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8715952 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8715953 all the agrarians have been saying for many years we dont need the wto
8715954 as long as there is a chance that well be in this storm ill be here in louisiana
8715955 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8715956 we cannot say what the regions energy needs will be by 2015
8715957 russian nuclear plants always appear in the federal plan first
8715958 the government always makes the decision to build a nuclear plant this is the first time ive seen otherwise
8715959 this project seems to have a political rather than an economic motivation
8715960 building new capacity of more than 1 000 megawatts is excessive for the kaliningrad region but otherwise it would continue to be dependent on european countries

8715968 hes got a belief in the excellence of products hes able to communicate that
8715969 steve had these dreams of becoming one of the great people that has companies and makes products that change the world

8715976 it can be the new blood and wide ranging experience of the outsourcers that allow the trust companies to achieve the growth rates of other wealth management business while maintaining the local presence and clients service that are the hallmarks of the u s trust industry
8715977 trust outsourcing assessing profits and opportunities in investment management and operations outsourcing
8715978 by using outsourcing trust companies can focus on those things that they do best including providing a local presence for wealth management delivered by a trusted advisor
8715979 a charge of misconduct or unsatisfactory conduct may be brought and a conviction may be obtained despite the charge not being based on a breach of any specific rule
8715980 in short it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now the purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit but to achieve the more prosperous expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus

8716008 had he issued todays executive order when we asked him to do so more than eight months ago thousands more floridians would have benefited waiting until august 27 when there are just over five weeks to register to vote for the november general election greatly diminishes the impact of the governors action
8716009 but the process remains archaic because florida is one of a few states that wont automatically restore civil rights to ex felons
8716010 if youre going to pat yourself on the back for restoring civil rights mr crist you may as well free up a few hands to finish what you started
8716011 basically i view it as part of the restoration of my life the opportunity for me to make a positive impact so others can see it from me
8716012 its not just about going in and getting your rights restored
8716013 were giving them a recipe for what they need to be doing so when the governor restores their rights hes restoring the rights of a productive citizen
8716014 personally i have advocated and continue to advocate for a change in the alabama constitution we have it within our power as citizens to amend the constitution to prevent all felons from voting not just those whose crimes involve moral turpitude
8716015 the united states supreme court has said that is lawful and i say it is good policy those who violate the laws should not have any role in electing the officials who make and enforce the law until the alabama constitution is amended however i will continue to advise registrars to follow the law and to defend it against the baseless attacks of the aclu
8716016 just the place for a snark i have said it twice
8716017 every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed
8716018 when i said that i wanted to be a comedian when i grow up they all laughed well no ones laughing now
8716019 i have to be very sincere the person that makes me feel very happy also because she chose vintage was julia roberts in erin brockovich when she got the academy award
8716020 i was very excited i was not in los angeles but i saw on television and i really was excited to see her when she appeared with my dress
8716021 when i work and i create i am not very approachable to know everything i say was being recorded did irritate me
8716022 the film was showing exactly what i am there were moments of anger when somebody says something that i dont like but i was completely myself from the beginning to the end and nothing was edited
8716023 it was amazing to kind of hang out with valentino and giancarlo for two years
8716024 if it doesnt change course if it goes through that heart of production were going to see a great deal of shut in
8716025 natural gas is used a lot to generate electricity and were in the middle of summer when everyone is using their air conditioning
8716026 theyve been on our radar for a long time because its something everybody knows about and its not something you can go there yourself to check it out at least not very easily
8716027 when we started to look into all the suspicions that were there there was a lot of meat for us to dig into especially since its sort of centered on special our daily work so we got into it
8716028 we felt that we couldnt put it to bed until we put our own stamp on it
8716029 sri lanka has been in the forefront of womens empowerment and it is certainly high time that a sri lankan woman took command of an airliner
8716030 the impact of higher gas prices on drivers accident severity and insurance costs is anything but simple
8716031 our findings indicate that higher average claim costs associated with lighter vehicles have the potential to offset to some extent whatever beneficial effects might occur from less driving
8716032 tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
8716033 john kijinski as dean is doing quite well at suny fredonia john knox will soon begin as dean at mankato state mark salisbury whom isu persecuted for over a year has won regional and national awards at u of iowa ed nuhfer is director of faculty development and professor of geoscience at california state university channel islands ed has been instrumental in securing three grants while being well supported to deliver academic workshops twice a month linda deck who made the idaho museum a major cultural centerpiece of se idaho and her husband ralph who brought in over a million in grants they are both are at los alamos one of isus top researchers rob van kirk has been snatched up this year by the cal state system at the humboldt campus
8716034 he is free of a lot of the battles and scars that many of us suffered
8716035 he never saw the signs that said white men colored men white women colored women
8716036 he never tasted the fruits of segregation and racial discrimination so he is a different human being he should be free to liberate the rest of america and maybe take a message to the rest of the world
8716037 les requ tes pourront tre formul es par crit en langage naturel ou via un syst me de reconnaissance vocale
8716038 i would say he is high up based on what we recovered at the scene by executing the search warrant
8716039 every game is a big game but thursday is a big chance for us to showcase nationally what we certainly hope to be about as a football program
8716040 the biggest challenge without a doubt is i feel like when people havent had a lot of success a lot of times theyre scared of success we cant be a university thats scared of success
8716041 i like to walk down paths nobody else wants to
8716042 people are just throwing names and number out there before anything has happened
8716043 before you even play a down of football you feel like you should be handed a trophy
8716044 i think being on both ends of the spectrum has really helped us stay grounded we know that we cant let that stuff get to us
8716045 with the expectations through the roof for this football team i think theres a little bit of pressure
8716046 i hope we handle it better than we did last year
8716047 im sorry i was remembering to put on all of my clothes
8716048 handguns are what you carry when you are absolutely positive that you will not be in a fight that day

8716050 an open content distribution system that will help end users find purchase download and install various types of content on their android powered devices
8716051 we feel that developers should have an open and unobstructed environment to make their content available

8716066 barack writes his speeches himself this ones had 4 000 drafts and he was toiling on it last night
8716067 hes been there six times and weve got a good chance in montana
8716068 barack told us from the first we were going to compete in every state we believe weve got 168 safe electoral votes and 32 leaning our way oregon washington minnesota and new hampshire its a lot hard for john mccain to make the numbers work if we win colorado it gets very hard for him
8716069 i got a call from barack asking if he could talk to me
8716070 around the campaign we have this saying no drama in obama
8716071 this is a campaign of smart young people one invented the idea of notifying anyone who signed up who the vice presidential nominee would be via cell phone we got two million new contacts
8716072 if people worry about what obama stands for this 77 page book will have it all
8716073 joe biden came to chicago and said treat me like staff put me to work we said well work you hard for six days and give you a day of rest biden said no sign me up for seven days a week to the end
8716074 our people went crazy contacting our supporters it was the single best fund raising day weve ever had
8716075 tear the hide off us and i think theyll be good at it this will be a very close election ten percent have not made up their minds
8716076 a passerby called in and said the guy was out of his vehicle and his pants were on fire
8716077 he wasnt there when everyone got there his pants were still there on the side of the road they were still smoldering
8716078 if there are no major shocks we would see single digit inflation by the end of next year
8716079 zombies cannot run so if you see a person running at you its not a zombie dont shoot him give him a high five
8716080 he doesnt matter my safety is more important than his
8716081 im just really shocked its not something you expect to happen on your first night in manchester
8716082 it was really quiet then i just heard a big bang i thought it was our house at first then i realised it had happened next door
8716083 there was glass everywhere but at least the woman living there was okay we moved here because wed heard it was the safest place for students to live in manchester
8716084 i heard a bang and the sound of glass smashing it was bad enough to shake our house there was smoke everywhere we have just moved in it was all quiet and then that happened
8716085 we were watching football on tv when it happened the tv was shaking we ran outside because we thought someone was trying to break in
8716086 we could see the woman inside trying to get out she was on the phone to the police a man helped her to get out
8716087 its just incredible its devastating she left me a message saying i think some sort of bomb has gone off in the house
8716088 were waiting for experts to make a more thorough assessment of the scene to try to establish exactly what has exploded to cause that amount of damage
8716089 what is apparent is that some sort of incendiary device has gone off in that porch area and has caused a significant amount of damage to the porch and indeed the front of the house as well
8716090 were unclear at this moment in time but looking at it it appears that something was pushed through the letterbox into the hallway or placed into the porch and has blown out
8716091 we can tell that by the way the debris has fallen on the driveway its a miracle that no one was hurt when you see the amount of damage
8716092 whoever did this clearly didnt care if anyone was hurt or killed and needs to be caught the damage was quite breathtaking
8716093 i cannot speculate on a motive for this but we are clearly dealing with people who have no regard for human life
8716094 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness
8716095 you will strike his heal and he will strike your head

8716099 when fans tune in theyll find unparalleled coverage of big ten and buckeye sports theyll see more action and more in depth analysis than ever before
8716100 it is not only a threat to international security but a breach of it
8716101 the territory previously known in soviet times as south ossetia is completely cleansed of remnants of the georgian population
8716102 in my opinion the main ethnic cleansing was evident when georgia made an aggression against south ossetia
8716103 an additional factor that needs to be taken into account
8716104 i dont see myself not being supportive of equal rights
8716105 i talked to my mom last night about all of it that was really hard ive talked to my dad a lot too its not like going to work in another u s city its halfway around the world in an entirely different culture without access to the people i love that have been such a huge part of my life
8716106 this isnt the first time this has ever happened to anybody
8716107 but that doesnt mean i cant miss him im going to of course im going to
8716108 the three aircraft inbound to vancouver are still in europe
8716109 as a result the three flights that we expected to arrive later this afternoon will not arrive
8716110 were just starting discussions with all the other airlines that fly to the same destinations in vancouver to see if they have space and can accommodate some of the folks that do arrive at the airport
8716111 part of the plan is to rightsize our headcount according to current and projected revenues
8716112 like our competitors we are affected by a number of economic events including the overall slowdown in the u s and global economies
8716113 its hard to draw any broad conclusions from what deloitte is saying as it relates to the rest of the industry
8716114 up until this point we are not seeing any pattern of workforce reductions
8716115 i was very conscious of children coming into the shop and buying things like sweets and fizzy drinks for their lunch even though i would feel that they had been told to buy a sandwich or the like and i was powerless to stop them now i feel that we are giving parents an alternative
8716116 since emotion plays a key role in the directing of our attention the task of the ad is to evoke emotion in us
8716117 affective content that drives advertising effectiveness and our thinking merely supports a decision that may have been already made
8716118 implicit learning that is environmental or peripheral learning is probably much more important than explicit conscious processes
8716119 simple unconscious and non verbal responses shortcuts to help us make choices
8716120 brain science suggests that much of what we know about brands is learned implicitly i e at low or no awareness which means that we know a lot about brands but dont necessarily know how or where we learned it
8716121 what prior memories have you got for me to relate to
8716122 simply because there is no need to retain them in working memory
8716123 consistent cohesive entity but is made up of a series of memories and associations that will never be stored or remembered in its pure form but as part of a much more complex and constantly evolving composite construct
8716124 nothing of a hurricane nature yet but you can tell that its coming
8716125 im here because im ready for a competent commander in chief
8716126 this administration has shown its typical clumsiness in how it deals with difficult problems
8716127 even when he was yelling at me i liked john mccain he was a maverick he really did have the straight talk express but hes changed over the years hes no longer a maverick the presidential campaign process has changed him hes completely lost his maverick streak and its a long time since weve heard straight talk from him
8716128 but my experience with obama has been the opposite every time i see him i get more behind him
8716129 second having spent a career studying and practicing leadership and still the only way i could get people to follow me was to buy them free whiskey this guy obama has a gift he is a leader he speaks and 20 000 people are ready to do follow him
8716130 i like his choice of biden with these man i think were in great shape for the next 8 years and barrack obama will be a great commander in chief

8716136 a full day of teaching and a full day of consulting every attendee will receive one on one time with the experts
8716137 the message that has come from the russians is one that is tied to invading another country invading sovereign territory
8716138 has a lot of us concerned about what it means now what it means a year from now what it means long term with our relationship on the military military side as well as the relationship between our two countries
8716139 certainly there is potential there because physically the russian navy is operating in the black sea so is the united states navy
8716140 weve worked hard over many years to figure out ways to both operate together operate around each other we know how to do that and i believe well continue to do that safely
8716141 they cant recreate the reagan coalition life has changed americas priorities are different
8716142 americans are still small c conservative that may be changing in regard to the republican party
8716143 there was a lot of lip service paid to ronald reagan by the candidates but when you get down to specifics they are tilting away from reagan toward some new mix
8716144 neocons are willing to throw out some of the principles of conservatism
8716145 christian conservatives are more demanding in tactics and goals than they were what theyve done is take conservatism from being a federalist approach with focus on liberty and make it a big government style of conservatism using the federal government to dictate what people do
8716146 its a very rare leader who can bring together disparate groups when they agree on 70 percent and disagree on 30 percent reagan was able to succeed at that bush has been much more typical more susceptible to these divisions
8716147 people now are looking for reasons to argue rather than reasons to cooperate
8716148 there are big elements still out there waiting for someone to unite them
8716149 what the portraits actually symbolise is a matter of how far down the rabbit hole you feel like burrowing
8716150 a rousing score memorable enough for you to leave playing when in ears reach of your console and catchy enough to hum to during your days activities
8716151 we made a real effort to find out and they were entirely uncommunicative
8716152 i came away with a very clear impression that something is going to happen that doing nothing is not a choice here
8716153 weve been telling them to think very carefully before acting and move very cautiously and whatever you do make sure that its multilateral not unilateral
8716154 it is pretty evident that the european government and our own government are weighing options right now
8716155 the situation is clearly at a serious level and theyre trying to find the right way to respond to this
8716156 russia has about 10 billion invested in the united states in the manufacturing sector and we about the same amount invested there theres really a very substantial
8716157 into account the fragile state of the young countries between the black and caspian seas
8716158 if they decide they dont want to pursue wto accession we cant make them if they pull out of something im not sure that qualifies as a sanction
8716159 whatever you do to the least of these you have done to me
8716160 the business of theology is to make sure that our questions to the scriptures of any religious tradition will be directed in such a way as to allow ourselves to be challenged and even shaken at the deepest levels of our existence by what the text says
8716161 someone left a loaf of banana bread and a thank you card on my doorstep i was really moved that someone who didnt even know me cared about me that much i wanted to do the banana bread thing too
8716162 were at war you cant just drive on to a military base unescorted
8716163 call me on your cell phone when you get to the gate
8716164 and ill come pick up the bread and deliver it for you
8716165 i wanted so much to give this gift to the visitor and everything went wrong i couldnt get on base i couldnt get through to my friend i was so mad i rolled down my window to pitch that stupid banana bread right out on highway 24
8716166 but with the lord tugging at my heart i pulled over
8716167 why do you want to deliver this banana bread so bad anyway
8716168 if your church can go to all this trouble for someone you dont even know
8716169 but it almost seemed pointless by that time god obviously had something else in mind all along
8716170 expectations for instantaneous results i think are probably a little bit too high
8716171 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be
8716172 were trying to figure out how that fits into bringing pressure onto that border to minimize the cross border operations from pakistan
8716173 the worlds love is temporary and based upon feelings and circumstances
8716174 i think the hardest interviews are when the person looks like they are about to collapse from nerves theyre sweating shaking and have their hopes and dreams pinned on becoming a designer that is hard to watch because im pulling for everyone
8716175 mobile browsing was considered a second class citizen on the web
8716176 you had to serve completely different content with a different markup language and different protocols
8716177 theres now a convergence of the desktop web and the mobile device web
8716178 the iphone really cracked that open and people are starting to think differently about the services on their device
8716179 people browsing the web from a mobile device dont expect an alternative universe which lacks features theyre used to
8716180 the migration to hyperconnectivity will create a profusion of devices applications and new business processes
8716181 the average hyperconnected individual uses at least seven devices to access the network and nine connectivity applications
8716182 the boundary between work and personal connectivity for the hyperconnected is almost nonexistent
8716183 two thirds use text or instant messaging for both work and personal use more than a third use social networking for both
8716184 the freedom to conduct work during personal time will force changes to personal use policies business practices training curricula and it support policies

8716200 all mankind is of one author and is one volume when one man dies one chapter is not torn out of the book but translated into a better language and every chapter must be so translated as therefore the bell that rings to a sermon calls not upon the preacher only but upon the congregation to come so this bell calls us all but how much more me who am brought so near the door by this sickness no man is an island entire of itself any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee

8716202 second it aggregates worship talk on the web pointing people to posts on other blogs and news sites regarding worship

8716208 it is of course unfortunate in the circumstances that we had to change the venue because we were all looking forward to a great awards night in pakistan
8716209 however it is good to bring such a prestigious event to the home of the icc

8716228 i have researched hotels that do not provide internet but are nearby wireless hubs to get connection freely
8716229 i went up to the top of a mountain and worked for a week from a tent
8716230 logged into hotel conference rooms to get the connection for free

8716233 held my laptop out a window to get the wi fi next door so i could send an important email
8716234 sat outside an airport for 4 hours so i could use the free wireless across the street
8716235 ive done a lot of crazy things but ill never be able to admit it or id lose my dignity
8716236 moved throughout my home because of connection problems i found myself sitting in a ducky chair in my toddlers room because that is where i got the best connection
8716237 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming

8716246 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
8716247 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well
8716248 we believe the story line of ultra low cost notebooks will increasingly be sidelined as the notebook market continues to offer a better solution and experience at price points similar to what ultra low cost notebooks are hitting
8716249 you are dealing with something which most of us wouldnt use
8716250 hes very healthy hes not fat at all hes just having a very good time
8716251 he ate crab cakes and he said that the spices were really hard for him
8716252 he likes lasagna he loves all italian food for a while i was making a lot of chicken and rice and he hated that
8716253 that doesnt mean those 2 million all went to the iphone
8716254 competition in enterprise smartphones is going to be between blackberry and windows mobile
8716255 this software also will help address the mobile industrys fragmentation issue by enabling developers to create a single interface that will work anywhere java is found
8716256 its real strength is in providing a rich framework that developers can easily build upon optimize collaborate around and then deploy on billions of devices
8716257 in this way lwuit is becoming a unifying ui layer that allows developers to focus on creating compelling user interfaces and ultimately delivering new and engaging applications across a wide range of platforms

8716262 were losing money as it is the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
8716263 project crackberry is a research project which aims to study the impact of push mail technology e g via blackberry on productivity and work life balance of professionals
8716264 i am a self declared crackberry crackberry is a nickname for the blackberry that was coined because of the devices addictive nature

8716270 i dont think rogers will make any changes to their pricing plans
8716271 this could be an opportunity for bell and telus which will be offering the blackberry bold sometime this summer
8716272 lower your prices and then i will think about it but until then no thanks not a chance
8716273 get a clue rogers this is outrageous when will canadians finally take a stand against rogers first high prices then no rollovers and now these outrageous iphone deals and a 3 year term get with it were far behind in the cell phone world far behind 3rd world countries
8716274 has always been to squeeze as much profit as they can from early adopters before introducing any price drop
8716275 rogers and other carriers will hold onto current price structures until new competitors enter the market and start offering lower prices
8716276 rogers has the monopoly on the iphone here and is confident the iphones appeal will win over users
8716277 most of our clients say they are likely to stick with their blackberries because their networks are heavily invested into these devices
8716278 this is a fairly straightforward procedure that has been used in the blackberry and other cell phones
8716279 this is the price we pay for fostering a monopolistic market weve seen this thing happen with the blackberry before and well see it with other devices until real competition comes around
8716280 when you grow up living in a white corporate world theres always a part of you that thinks gee if i sold out or how can i do this and also stay true to myself and true to my own identity
8716281 here we have a guy whos running for president and managed to do it in the political world and managed to do it so well
8716282 theres a sense of not only pride but of a point in the culture were a part of the society were a part of that this is different
8716283 its a measure of how far we and i dont mean just black people how far this country and the business world have come
8716284 close the digital divide in a way the pc never could
8716285 voice is still the killer app in many developing countries data is going to be playing catch up for a long time to come
8716286 with so many players on both teams there has to be some cross fertilization going on and no doubt some discussions
8716287 having an open source os that is adopted by a broad array of device manufacturers allows the manufacturers to better compete for additional business by allowing sales of games music videos apps and other services even on those devices not manufactured by their own company
8716288 google is learning how hard it is to create a good mobile os
8716289 the mobile market needs some level of consolidation of platforms if it is to make big leaps forward as app developers currently struggle to make their products available on so many platforms
8716290 a combination of the android and symbian efforts would be good for the industry good for google and good for symbian
8716291 it would also help spur growth in the availability of applications and services the downside is minimal everyone wins

8716303 the sub committee includes seven club representatives and they formed some recommendations which went to the afl commission on monday
8716304 we are now in the process of finalising that list development recommendation
8716305 we treat him as one of the most dangerous players in their team hes certainly going to be one to look out for
8716306 hes going to want to play his best game of the year against us and were prepared for that
8716307 souths fans will probably be hoping he punches me in the head again
8716308 i will be just trying to tackle him hes a big boy so i dont want to get in the way of him
8716309 were probably letting ourselves and each other down a bit when you lose three in a row you are looking for answers from everywhere
8716310 you dont want to go too far into it and you dont want to over analyse you want to work as a team and focus on the football
8716311 for me its a big game i love playing against souths all my family and friends come out here i know most of the people sitting in the crowd so it gets me going
8716312 the roosters are a quality football team and we want to show that we can be competitive against teams of their calibre
8716313 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant
8716314 sparse capacity means that every barrel of oil lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner

8716316 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8716317 our set piece really let us down in the last match but its been a great experience for our front row in particular to come over here to england and experience the different conditions and the different types of pressure
8716318 at the end of the day we wont be judging ourselves on results on this tour but by what we learned and how we adapted to different situations in games
8716319 leicester are one week out from competition so they will be using this match as an opportunity to look at combinations for the start of the season
8716320 i think if it goes past five rounds hoppa will just blow up
8716321 it would mean everything especially with what happened in my rugby league career getting run out of the game
8716322 taking this boxing up it would mean everything to me to get a title around my waist i want to go as far as i can
8716323 this is a stepping stone getting an australian title and fighting overseas youve got to fight the best if you want to be the best
8716324 i am going to stop the story of the footballers taking over boxing
8716325 i dont begrudge them coming into the sport if they want to work hard and do all the right things
8716326 we are like brothers the only time you fight brothers is at christmas when youve had too much to drink
8716327 we dont know for sure because nobody is keeping tabs of the dead
8716328 what we do know is we have 155 live penguins we are treating for oil intoxication
8716329 the large crowd that we expect is indicative of the campaign that senator obama has run from the beginning change happens from the bottom up
8716330 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8716331 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8716332 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8716333 with the iphone people have a sense that they can or should be able to browse the full web

8716335 people who will typically discuss their vote with one other person and then
8716336 were much more simple this time than we have been in the past
8716337 basically sen mccain and his staff feel that to do something real glitzy and las vegas like would be inappropriate the way the economy is
8716338 now senator mccain has served his country with courage and honour for many years
8716339 john mccain was a hero for our country in vietnam
8716340 now senator obamas a friend of mine and is a brave and courageous leader of the black community who has served the people of illinois valiantly but i disagree with him over the price of gas
8716341 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8716342 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8716343 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8716344 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
8716345 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our email boxes
8716346 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8716347 rob anderson doesnt own a car but he thinks bikes are a menace on city streets
8716348 in his lawsuit he argued that more space for bikes means less space for cars and therefore more traffic and pollution he prevailed in court so san francisco is preparing an environmental impact report on the proposed bicycle lanes anderson the journal said is pondering another legal challenge
8716349 if you want to stay alive you shouldnt be riding a bike from marin to sf

8716352 phil tuned pianos he could take anything apart and put it back together and he loved opera
8716353 had pride in his accomplishments and abilities but he didnt overwhelm you with it he also loved the history and the allure of the automobile
8716354 i had an amazing amount of luck to race for 22 years and not a drop of blood or a broken bone

8716361 we remain on schedule to deliver the first android based handset in the second half of 2008 and were very excited to see the momentum continuing to build behind the android platform among carriers handset manufacturers developers and consumers
8716362 i think there are going to be many mobile phone platforms its not going to converge quickly
8716363 the only mobile platform thats widely used to access the net is the iphone and its a totally controlled ecosystem where youre only allowed to write the programs apple says youre allowed to write
8716364 this sponsorship will enable the asf to pay administrators and other support staff so that asf developers can focus on writing great software
8716365 the open web foundation differs from most formal standards bodies as it is based around individual membership like the apache software foundation and is designed to have a lightweight process which makes it easier for a community of individuals and or companies to come together and start work on an open specification
8716366 like the apache software foundation the incubation process will also focus on building a diverse community of contributors to each specification as well as ensuring the existence of multiple interoperable implementations like the ietf does
8716367 one thing i dont like about oscon is it feels a little bit too commercial for me
8716368 companies come and they want to pitch open source as a magic solution to any problem and really im more of a coder than a business person

8716460 part of the reason were in this mortgage mess is that many borrowers naively believed what mortgage professionals were telling them and didnt verify the information or shop around for a better deal

8716464 dollar demand at the end of the month end and outflows from the equity markets persisted
8716465 clearly the market had bet on some moderation in inflation thats why we saw yields easing in the afternoon
8716466 there was discomfort after the rupee fell past 44 per dollar which gave rise to speculation the central bank will intervene
8716467 with proper valuations the issues will get adequate response historically such ipos are known to be modestly priced this is the best time for psus to raise money and give a boost to investor sentiment it will provide relief to investors who have seen severe erosion in wealth during the first day of listing in the recent past
8716468 the current divestment of psus is very relevant for the primary market as historically psu ipos have been modestly priced and investor gains could rekindle some interest but by themselves state run company ipos wont be able to revive the primary market entirely
8716469 the value unlocking that the psus bring not only to the public but also to the government is enormous the public money is flowing back to the public with lots of value addition its not through privatisation but through selling only modest 5 15 stakes after the divestment the companies go through the rigour of compliance to the stock exchanges and better scrutiny of the management and hence better accountability to public money
8716470 to avoid any allegations of wrongdoing the most transparent method of divestment is clearly by way of a public issue of shares

8716518 the verbiage has never been the issue its been the chain of actions required to actually follow the feed for first time subscribers
8716519 in the case of diso endpoints i believe well have some kind of callback mechanism that is advertised on your identity provider data broker that expresses where you maintain your followed sites contacts friends for example when sign in to blogger with your openid your follower list would be advertised as a service in your xrds simple discovery profile

8716522 the united states military has secretly handed over more than 200 militants to the intelligence services of saudi arabia egypt and other countries nearly all in the past two years as part of an effort to reduce the burden of detaining and interrogating foreign fighters captured in iraq and afghanistan according to american military officials the system is similar in some ways to the rendition program used by the central intelligence agency since the sept 11 attacks to secretly transfer people suspected of being militants back to their home countries to be jailed and questioned

8716556 if you hit a rough patch here in kansas city the parent company can prop you up and keep you going
8716557 we didnt design a green ballpark for the accolades but it sure is nice

8716563 unbeknownst to the computer user redirected the users computer to the ebay web site without the user actually clicking on an ebay advertisement link or even becoming aware that they had left the page they were previously viewing as a result the ebay site would be prompted to drop an ebay cookie on the users computer even though the user never clicked on an ebay advertisement or even realized that their computer had ever visited the ebay site

8716565 supported by russia abkhazia and south ossetia achieved de facto independence from georgia more than 250 000 georgians were ethnically cleansed from abkhazia by abkhaz separatists and north caucasians volunteers including chechens in 1992 1993 more than 25 000 georgians were expelled from tskhinvali as well and many ossetian families were forced to abandon their homes in the borjomi region and move to russia
8716566 b ut these reforms have been complicated by two ethnic conflicts in the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia these two territories remain outside the control of the central government and are ruled by de facto unrecognized governments supported by russia
8716567 it looks like georgian troops invaded south ossetia and started shelling tskhinvali the capital of the region
8716568 president bush called for an end to the russian bombings and an immediate halt to the violence
8716569 hey kublai if south ossetians want to be russian citizens they can move to north ossetia which is part of russia not liking that the country you invaded in the 20s isn t a part of russia anymore or that it aspires to be something more than a backwards pack of criminals and bullies doesn t mean you get to steal part of it
8716570 how can you possibly blame the people living in south ossetia right now for what their grandfather and great grandfathers did and moreover lets not make georgia out be some paragon of virtue either because last i checked jailing journalists wasn t considered a democratic move
8716571 the only good time that we stuck our noses in was wwii when it should have been sooner despite accurate intelligence received
8716572 i hope you realize the delicious irony in those comments because that is exactly what we did in texas and several other western states

8716575 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 18 386 for each eye treated
8716576 but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period
8716577 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8716578 we knew there were issues with stefan going back to last spring weve talked through it with him and we havent had any success
8716579 considered to be one of the top prospects in all of hockey and a well known player in canada because of his high energy agitating play and his off ice humor
8716580 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
8716581 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
8716582 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
8716583 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
8716584 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation

8716599 its a classic case of the abortion lobbys political and financial interests trumping the truth
8716600 over 600 post abortive women asked to meet with the apa about their experiences with abortion and depression
8716601 the apa brushed them off just like it dismissed any scientific study that didnt agree with its agenda
8716602 completely disregarded credible research that shows abortion increasing the risk of clinical depression suicide drug and alcohol abuse and post traumatic stress disorder
8716603 flies in the face of what pregnancy centers see every day
8716604 the apa may continue to politicize abortion but care net and its network of affiliated pregnancy centers are committed to providing medically referenced and accurate information about abortion risks to empower women to make informed health decisions
8716605 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
8716606 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
8716607 the apa report in fact does draw a very strong and dogmatic conclusion that cannot be defended on the basis of evidence since this evidence is lacking by the admission of the report
8716608 what the committee has in effect said is that until there is compelling evidence to the contrary people should act as though abortion has no harmful effects this is not a defensible position in a situation in which there is evidence pointing in the direction of harmful effects

8716620 we wanted to produce a large number of disease models for ourselves our collaborators and the stem cell research community to accelerate research

8716623 the largest source of funding for embryonic and pluripotent stem cell research in the world
8716624 it appears that the cirm s love affair with slow inefficient expensive ethically fraught and legally complex human embryonic stem cells may be drawing to a close
8716625 it may not yet be a full fledged exodus but it would appear that the tide has changed dramatically
8716626 if this continues and it becomes clear that the tide is irreversibly flowing toward ipsc s the political ability to create an international ban on human cloning with the catcalls of cures to distract leaders from doing the right thing will increase we may actually be able to throttle human cloning before it gets too far out of the test tube
8716627 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway

8716672 this is a painful day because of our affection for marcus who is certainly a class act in emotional situations such as this we understand players are simply people who wear jerseys for a living but underneath those uniforms they are real people whose hopes and dreams matter just as much to them as people in every other walk of life as such we did everything humanly possible to trade marcus which would have allowed him to play under the conditions of his contract with us unfortunately we werent able to make that happen
8716673 while this concludes one chapter with marcus and the saskatchewan roughriders we have discussed the possibility of him remaining with our organization in a different capacity those discussions will continue and of course its also very possible marcus will choose to play for another team in our league regardless though of what decisions marcus and mona make we wish them and their family the very best

8716676 photographer corinne day made me less self conscious of myself
8716677 at the time he was such a dickhead he wasnt very nice

8716680 his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension
8716681 shes in tears up to three times a day and so tired that brads found her collapsed asleep in the bath twice
8716682 shes been working around the clock breast feeding the babies and trying to get them to sleep but as soon as one of them drops off the other wakes up for another feed
8716683 shes also not eating very much right now and blames that on being busy the doctor says that she needs more calories to gain strength and ensure that her breast milk is healthy

8716686 if that is true if that is confirmed then thats really bad its very dangerous and a mistaken policy
8716687 it that was the case then the recent events could have a american domestic political dimension
8716688 we work exceptionally hard to minimize any collateral damage zero collateral damage is the goal
8716689 im encouraged that hes taken action and i also think its going to take some time
8716690 prescheduled meeting aimed at discussing security matters at strategic level the discussion was held in an open and cordial manner
8716691 understand this microsofts business model only incidentally includes selling an operating system at retail
8716692 there are exactly two companies making money off a pc operating system right now and both of them make their money from the hardware sale not from a boxed software sale
8716693 apple makes money because they offer a special platform that people want
8716694 they can make enough to stay healthy and invest so much into r amp d because they sell the platform with premium hardware
8716695 theres nothing monopolistic or anticompetitive about it anyone can do what apple does they just cant do it with apples stuff its theirs they created it they own it case closed
8716696 just because the bulk of the market does something a certain way doesnt mean everyone must should or even can
8716697 where the early adopters and the discretionary spenders were leading the charge now as we go into the 30 range for planned purchases the change to apple looks permanent what we have in the end actually were sort of there now is that buying an apple is as normal as buying a dell or an hp computer in america
8716698 you want to see what a halo effect looks like take a look at last year
8716699 this years halo isnt to the degree of last years but in this economic environment and the fact that apples hitting its biggest numbers ever means its enough to see apple significantly outperform expectations going forward
8716700 everything else equal apples outperforming in an incredibly difficult consumer spending environment
8716701 standard for determining competency is whether the minor has the present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding as well as factually understanding the proceedings against him
8716702 working with the minor over time will lead him to be able to at least understand flies in the face of the second prong that the minor presently has a reasonable factual understanding of the proceedings in other words the question is not can the minor become competent in the future with assistance rather the question is whether he is presently competent which the court impliedly found he was not
8716703 for all the reasons given herein and in the briefs to the court of appeal
8716704 while counsel may have doubted boltons claim that one of the victims had a razor blade counsel did not know this was false
8716705 although attorneys may not present evidence they know to be false or assist in perpetrating known frauds on the court they may ethically present evidence that they suspect but do not personally know is false criminal defense attorneys sometimes have to present evidence that is incredible and that not being naive they might personally disbelieve presenting incredible evidence may raise difficult tactical decisions if counsel finds evidence incredible the fact finder may also but as long as counsel has no specific undisclosed factual knowledge of its falsity it does not raise an ethical problem

8716712 i know that everton are a big club who have a history of playing in important competitions like the uefa cup
8716713 i know that you dont want to hear it especially coming from someone so young
8716714 we see this a lot with what some have called eye candy we get many requests to make the base user interface more fun with animations and graphics like those found on competing products while at the same time some say get rid of graphics and go back to windows 2000
8716715 the ability to have choice and control what goes on in your pc is of paramount importance to us and you will see us continue to focus on these attributes with windows 7
8716716 as a microsoft oem id love to segment functionality of vista because the machines i offer in the low end mainstream consumer segment may not have the cpu and gpu power to run vista correctly
8716717 i want to be sure that end user experience is the best and most appropriate for the performance of the machine
8716718 i think everyone wants a mac os experience or a vista premium experience the marketing works in the mac world because apple isnt selling 399 499 mainstream machines with yesterdays cpu theyre selling 1 000 state of art hardware
8716719 microsoft is caught trying to be all things to all people and as a result can never completely succeed at it
8716720 were kind of being attacked from a single competitor with a point of view that is more closed and offers much less choice that is much more narrow
8716721 we live in a visual society where aesthetics are everything

8716727 the e mail coupons are being printed and brought in daily and people are fighting to get on my e mail subscription list
8716728 even if someone has to cart me into the car on sunday ive done all i can i can be pleased and proud of myself
8716729 i dont think ive blown myself out of it i could have done but i didnt
8716730 the greens are not overly smooth but i felt i was a little bit unlucky every time i hit it in the rough i got a bad lie
8716731 i said last year that the greens were awful and something needed to be done
8716732 im not a bad putter and i cant remember the last time i three putted from 18 inches
8716733 at the end of the week unfortunately the tournament could be won or lost by luck on the greens
8716734 they the ryder cup hopefuls are the people i feel really sorry for there is a lot riding on that
8716735 you cant bring the ryder cup onto greens like this hopefully they will rip them up and re do them
8716736 hopefully they wont use the same designer who had two goes at doing the seventh i think my kids could come up with a better design than that in one afternoon

8716740 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8716741 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it
8716742 typically the gps data being used is for the purpose of contradicting defendants alibis
8716743 i think that in the last couple of years people are starting to be aware that if they have these units in their car people can keep track of you
8716744 i think its a growing public awareness the problem is that most people feel like im not doing anything wrong so who cares but i think thats the wrong way of looking at it
8716745 basically the herald elicited a statement from us on one issue and used the statement to report on another
8716746 just shows us where we need to direct our disaster preparedness effort
8716747 the findings in this report will aid public health and emergency preparedness efforts and may help reduce the mortality burden in future natural disasters
8716748 the bottom line is that to build this water plant the taxpayers are getting soaked
8716749 the need to complete important projects like the water plant has not diminished
8716750 we cant sit back and let others worry about the future
8716751 i have never understood how putting a building underground is cheaper than putting a building aboveground
8716752 all other things being equal it may be more expensive to have the plant underground than at the surface level but it wasnt all other things being equal the length of tunneling that was required at the respective sites was a significant factor
8716753 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8716754 the material that was supposed to be destroyed was already superseded and had been replaced
8716755 there is no risk to the security of the weapon system and no possibility of an inadvertent launch as a result of this being taken from the weapon facility

8716814 we were educated by customers by what they wanted and we were educated by customers by what they used
8716815 customers want to have some tools to give themselves predictable costs
8716816 you know those stories out there every now and then you hear about them that are really poor terrible customer experiences where somebodys got a five figure data bill because their kid went and watched movies or something where they werent sure of the data usage thats not going to happen
8716817 in the last 30 days ive used 12gb not abusive for an unlimited account in my estimation
8716818 i mentioned i didnt see youtube as a streaming service the way the internet is now its almost impossible to avoid multimedia
8716819 these are not typical or normal users their activities are placing extreme demands on the network that are simply way beyond reasonable
8716820 as we contacted those customers we found that some were well aware that they were violating the terms of service and were not surprised to get a call from us just like the wired internet we know that some abusers employ a strategy of moving from carrier to carrier and abusing the services until they get caught
8716821 they also tend to be the most vocal on online blogs claiming that their rights have been violated
8716822 we have very strong job growth we have average incomes that are increasing faster than the provincial average
8716823 when i hear projects i hear jobs that drives the real estate market
8716824 im being brutally honest here we put this report out every couple of years and i thought that edmonton would not make number one
8716825 we dove into the numbers and sure enough the people living in edmonton should be smiling because not only is it the best place in alberta to invest its by far the best place in canada

8716831 the deputy mayor has said repeatedly in conversations with the businesses at public hearings in the newspaper on television that he is not just willing but eager to meet with the businesses so we can have real discussions with them and help them relocate
8716832 their reluctance to meet seems to have waned of late and thats a good thing

8716860 the success of hezbollah in the negotiations is a national success for the party and for the struggle of the lebanese
8716861 historical victory against the israeli enemy and its hostile policies
8716862 what horrifies me most are not radicals cheering terrorist samir kuntar but that most relative moderates feel compelled to do so at the airport to greet him were leaders of lebanons anti syrian anti iranian druze and christian groups as well as the ambassadors from egypt jordan the uae and morocco to avoid being discredited relative moderates must affirm that anyone who murders israeli children is a hero
8716863 the only way to prevent another war is to make it clear that should war break out lebanon may be razed to the ground not only will the lebanese government fear it so would hezbollah this will deter the group if it realizes that aggression on its part would result in destruction that would outrage the population and turn it against hezbollah
8716864 when you look at the scene things could have been much worse
8716865 if we come to the irrevocable conclusion that we should have an election its not because we have polls that are any different than anybody else

8716870 it is not up to me but up to moslems themselves to tear out the hateful verses from the quran in 1945 nazism was defeated in europe in 1989 communism was defeated in europe now the islamic ideology has to be defeated
8716871 stressed repeatedly and with irritation that wilders and no one else was responsible for any violence that might break out after his films release
8716872 incite acts of violence xenophobia or related intolerance and discrimination towards islam
8716873 on the contrary if we leave out the first images and the sound of the page being torn it could be a film of the islamist mujahideen
8716874 the sound you heard was a page being ripped from the phone book for it is not up to me but muslims themselves to tear out the hateful pages from the quran
8716875 the fact is that the inability to compel the attendance of the witnesses is a serious if not fatal blow to the defense in the removal proceedings
8716876 the governors refusal to seek subpoena power combined with the refusal of the witnesses to appear voluntarily deprives
8716877 to present governor granholm with duplicative testimony from him would be time consuming unwarranted and unnecessarily burdensome
8716878 although it would be a pleasure to appear before the governor samuel mccargo is confident that to testify again in this matter would be unduly repetitious

8717006 the new industrial and commercial abatement program includes significant changes to eligibility and benefit schedules that should slow the growth in foregone tax revenue that would have occurred under icip because of the incremental nature of both the old and new programs it will take many years for the city to fully realize those savings
8717007 we think that icap has made some strides in narrowing down the available commercial benefits for retail and it does in manhattan lower the amount of time that commercial properties have access to the subsidies but it still allows them the subsidy for ten years and many of these are large midtown manhattan commercial firms that dont need the help and these are substantial buildings that would otherwise contribute a large amount to the tax base

8717016 let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there
8717017 especially catholics are persecuted above all because of our social efforts to help the poor
8717018 we catholics have never proselytized but we have always given good example by helping others i think that for these people who are fanning the flames our charitable work is an unforgivable sin
8717019 at that time the ire of extremists was concentrated on the destruction of the belongings of catholics and now it is on the direct attack of people the number of victims is still not definitively known i have received news of five victims and numerous wounded some seriously i pray to god this will all end soon and reason will soon prevail again
8717020 it is not necessary but it is fair to say that people are using a pseudo religious pretext for matters of a political nature catholics in orissa are a small community about one percent of the population our faithful support peaceful coexistence with those who belong to other faiths and they have whenever possible good relations with their hindu neighbors
8717021 the children and some of the nuns probably hid in the neighboring plantations however i cannot say anything definitive about her fate i pray that god will protect these innocent victims
8717022 has surely fled from the hindu fanatics who were gathered outside the building to set it on fire i have spoken to him by phone he has described the events with anguish i have told him to pray fervently and to save himself
8717023 as far as i know the pastoral center has suffered serious damage perhaps irreparable this was a work that many of faithful sacrificed greatly for we were very proud of it
8717024 the numbers are increasing probably because children are more aware of the service and more able to contact it because they have mobile phones but it also shows a serious underlying problem
8717025 our busiest times are evenings and at weekends when social services are not available we need a proper out of hours support system for children

8717045 in the last 28 years we have seen huge differences and divisiveness on the issue of abortion in many situations quite frankly that issue alone has elected a member of congress to the house or a member of congress to the u s senate
8717046 its time that we take the politics out of abortion
8717047 for me it is time that the debate moves to a different level and that different level is the bill that we have introduced both republicans and democrats that will help reduce the number of abortions by up to 95 percent over the next 10 years
8717048 it is a blessing to know that at least for the first time our democratic party has made reducing abortions a major part of the democratic party platform
8717049 seventy percent believe that an abortion takes a life thats pretty startling
8717050 im excited that democrats at this convention are listening to those of us who believe that we have to champion the unborn child
8717051 the pregnant women support act is critical to achieving that
8717052 in 1973 nearly nine percent of births resulted in adoption by the year 2000 that had dropped to one percent why is that
8717053 democrats who are pro life democrats make a difference in our platform
8717054 as democrats weve got our work cut out for us no doubt
8717055 we dont talk enough about how this is a life issue
8717056 look as a church you can talk all you want we have to do something about it until you as a republican or you as a democrat does something about it it will only be talk
8717057 there is nothing greater than having my daughter sitting in my lap
8717058 as a community we should be able to show that by support for women who maybe have that uncertainty
8717059 we have to make a difference as pro life democrats and thats why im a strong supporter for democrats for life
8717060 reducing abortion should be something that both parties should agree on
8717061 but because someone failed the first nine months but then they do better the next nine months does that make your failure justified
8717062 i dont understand the analogy yes i hear it all the time what about after the baby gets here
8717063 well if i need a grant if i need an education if i need help i first have to get here
8717064 there hasnt been a big focus on the abortion issue at this convention and its very encouraging to hear people talk about helping pregnant women and to have pro life democrats leading and speaking at the convention being part of the party and also part of the platform
8717065 so its been a very encouraging week and weve had nothing but support people are welcoming us its been a very good week
8717066 yes the cars are very expensive they cost about the same as a land cruiser jeep the reason is that the cars have to be custom made
8717067 the cars are primarily rented by tourists who are extremely ecologically minded although they are also very popular with journalists the drawback is that there is currently only one hydrogen filling station in the country which means that customers can only travel 160 km before needing to refuel
8717068 in iceland either geothermal energy or hydroelectric power is used to fuel the production of hydrogen fuel but many countries have ample amounts of wind energy or solar power that can be used for powering hydrogen fuel production
8717069 i know that there are criticisms from some environmentalists about the production of hydrogen from fuels such as natural gas but because the efficiency of hydrogen as a fuel is approximately 40 percent rather than the 18 25 percent for petrol or diesel hydrogen still works out as a better option
8717070 altogether there have been nine student projects over the last four years there are currently two students but we expect the number to increase in the near future
8717071 but it is important to make clear that this is not government policy
8717072 they the government support various tests and demonstrations and expect a well informed market to pick the most viable choice for locally made fuel types and although we test the cars if they are not satisfactory on our terms we may send them back we do not have the financial resources to test more than this number of cars
8717073 i went in there on june 5 and was back in there seven days later as the infection was still there
8717074 i was advised from swabs taken that i had contracted mrsa and they started treating me with intravenous antibiotics
8717075 three weeks before i left i was told that i had positive vre
8717076 if the antibiotics dont stem the infection then more radical surgery may be necessary with the loss of a limb
8717077 but theres too many cases of it in the hospital theres too many cases in that ward to be unlucky
8717078 there was about two or three four bed rooms all with four people in them
8717079 there was a case of one elderly patient i know of who was advised to leave the hospital because they had a high risk of contracting mrsa
8717080 patients requiring rehabilitation geriatrics or slow stream medical care are routinely transferred to sub acute hospitals such as port kembla or bulli for care once their illness or injury has been managed
8717081 a part time infectious diseases physician has also been temporarily appointed while recruitment on a permanent basis proceeds and a specialist infectious diseases senior nurse manager has also been appointed
8717082 council was extremely happy with the allocation we received the allocation was over what council had originally budgeted for
8717083 the funding provides a fairly substantial proportion of our yearly works budget
8717084 the grant allocation is determined independently and is untied so that councils can spend them in accordance with local priorities
8717085 we also understand how important the grants are for rural and regional councils where these funds can comprise more than half of council revenue
8717086 it would be silly to think there wont be a section of the government that will look broadly at the illawarra
8717087 it may change boundaries just in shellharbour and wollongong it may not but there will be a review of some sort at state government level
8717088 kiama is seen as the emerald in the south coast crown were the green space wollongong would love to have us and shoalhaven would give their right arm to have us
8717089 even for people who dont play cricket its still inspiring for people to know that the don went to our school
8717090 he was the sort of person people look up to
8717091 his integrity his honesty modesty and all of those sorts of virtues he brought them all to the game

8717137 i have a different political standpoint im voting for obama i think his proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer

8717145 no one can really respect religion and insult its forms granting that the forms are not immediately from god still long use has made them divine to us for the spirit of religion has so penetrated and quickened them that to destroy them is in respect to the multitude of men to unsettle and dislodge the religious principle itself

8717147 las cinco empresas de transporte est n intimadas dentro de cada empresa hay varias l neas que no cobran el boleto estudiantil
8717148 las empresas tienen 15 d as para hacer los descargos correspondientes
8717149 hemos constatado la infracci n hicimos la intimaci n y ya se ha solucionado
8717150 esta decisi n de las empresas de transporte es arbitraria
8717151 las empresas van a tener que afrontar esta situaci n y las multas correspondientes porque hay una ordenanza aprobada por el concejo que establece el boleto estudiantil no hay otro escenario posible que no sea la soluci n de estas infracciones
8717152 este convenio va a permitir tener un conocimiento cabal de la situaci n y un proyecto ejecutivo de las obras de fondo que hay que hacer para lograr un nivel de protecci n adecuada las cuales estar n incorporadas al presupuesto del a o 2009 y 2010

8717155 buscamos que la ciudad de santa fe no se vuelva a inundar y lo mejor que podemos hacer es trabajar en forma conjunta con la municipalidad y las universidades en definitiva todos somos hijos de la reforma universitaria y en estos 90 a os el mejor homenaje que le podemos hacer es convocar a todos los que tenemos algo que ver con esa vieja reforma para que logremos los conocimientos y la sabidur a para poder abordar esos problemas que tanta angustia han causado y que siempre que pasan creemos que no van a volver a ocurrir tenemos que entender que ste es un problema recurrente y que cuanto m s hagamos para protegernos menos tendremos que lamentarnos
8717156 es el resultado del compromiso asumido desde el inicio de las gestiones provincial y municipal que es entender que en la ciudad de santa fe el problema de la vulnerabilidad frente a la creciente de los r os paran y salado y a las precipitaciones es uno de los temas m s relevantes y tambi n de comprender la importancia de las capacidades instaladas que tiene la ciudad contar con dos universidades el ina los t cnicos y profesionales del ministerio que para el gobierno de la ciudad es una posibilidad que debe ser aprovechada

8717169 the church is in a unique position in its marriage preparation it offers something couples cannot get in a hotel or stately home and tries to demonstrate its care about not just the big day but all the days afterwards
8717170 when the researchers asked newly weds about their churchs preparatory sessions they discovered a clear mismatch between what couples wanted and what was on offer
8717171 many had already lived through the life lessons that the church was eager to teach them especially if like most they had lived together before marriage
8717172 the vows work extremely well as a teaching vehicle that the couples attention is very much on their wedding day and that prep works best when you focus them on what they are promising

8717181 this administration has shown its typical clumsiness in how it deals with difficult problems
8717182 even when he was yelling at me i liked john mccain he was a maverick he really did have the straight talk express but hes changed over the years hes no longer a maverick the presidential campaign process has changed him hes completely lost his maverick streak and its a long time since weve heard straight talk from him
8717183 but my experience with obama has been the opposite every time i see him i get more behind him
8717184 second having spent a career studying and practicing leadership and still the only way i could get people to follow me was to buy them free whiskey this guy obama has a gift he is a leader he speaks and 20 000 people are ready to do follow him

8717192 one that includes several types of schools including denominational schools
8717193 these are highly emotive terms which are insulting to parents and should have no place in irish public debate
8717194 is it possible never mind desirable to have in every city town and village different types of schools that reflect the individual wishes of each and every subset of parents
8717195 already it is clear that attempts thus far to provide for a limited amount of faith and linguistic diversity are directly responsible for many children being educated in substandard school conditions
8717196 attempts have been made to portray the into as against denominational schools when the reality is that teachers have indicated in several surveys their support for religious education in schools
8717197 it is not a case of trying to drive religion out of schools neither is it a case of trying to build a one size fits all model
8717198 diversity is part of our society so also is freedom of religion these are not mutually exclusive and both can be accommodated in the community national school

8717220 the problem is that if you happen to be an individual who has the wrong genetic code in tlr3 you might inadvertently trigger a detrimental effect in your retina

8717222 this discovery has significant implications for diagnosing the dry form of amd which is the most prevalent form affecting more than 8 million americans
8717223 it also allows us to develop new drugs to treat the dry form of amd for which there currently is no treatment

8717226 so when the time comes for us to start thinking about intervention we might want to get genotyped first and then decide what kind of therapeutic paradigm might be most appropriate for us
8717227 if we can figure out which viruses might be acting as triggers we might be able to find a way to combat them this would be a far more effective therapy in my view than trying to design a gene therapy approach

8717240 i think this will take place within the coming week
8717241 we have long shared an understanding on this issue so the coordination and signing process will not take long
8717242 we are now focusing on relations with russia as they allow us to solve all key issues
8717243 this question is not being discussed our status has been determined by the constitution and a national referendum
8717244 weve seen reports that there are atrocities being committed against civilians and we want to call on the russians to allow a credible investigation to take place of reports that atrocities have been committed by both sides
8717245 obviously these types of reports are of serious concern and we want to make sure that the international community is able to investigate these charges
8717246 unlike some of our major western partners we prefer every country to think for itself
8717247 must have the right to return to their homeland and we are discussing the issue with israel and i want to insist on the fact that we are opposed to the implantation of palestinians in lebanon
8717248 one of the aims of the palestinians is to guarantee the human rights for the palestinian community in lebanon which are negated by all the lebanese laws
8717249 until now we are discriminated against and i think the suffering of the palestinians must be ended on the other hand there are a lot of political issues who are not solved between the palestinians and the lebanese one of them is the arms and i think the lebanese have their file and the palestinians have their file so positively i hope they will discuss the matters with much more mature experience of the last decades
8717250 in the past 30 months and in a politically motivated move orchestrated by a few of its permanent members the security council has taken unlawful unnecessary and unjustifiable actions in adopting resolutions against the islamic republic of iran over its peaceful nuclear program which presents no threat to international or regional peace and security
8717251 these actions have been taken against our nation only because we have decided to exercise our inalienable right to peaceful uses of nuclear technology as enshrined in the npt
8717252 we concur with the view that the composition of the security council is not representing the realities of the international community today and this issue should be thoroughly addressed and resolved in any meaningful reform of the united nations

8717255 a georgian drone was flying from south to north over tskhinvali at 00 10 moscow time 20 10 gmt south ossetian military units opened fire at the uav and shot it down

8717257 it is different to what you would get under ordinary circumstances war surgery is not something that you would learn in depth at medical college
8717258 this year the programme targeted personnel working in hospitals in the conflict zone like jaffna padaviya mannar and vavuniya
8717259 the participants include doctors and others like nurses and physiotherapists involved with treating the wounded
8717260 you have to know what a bullet will do when it hits the body or a fragmentation mine or a landmine and when the wounded start coming in in large numbers triage is very vital you classify cases based on the extent of the injuries
8717261 we got a chance to compare our management methods with those from other situations in the world
8717262 there was a lot of emphasis on newer techniques in triage and treating trauma
8717263 that will help us to gain greater knowledge of the wounds and what needs to be done
8717264 the next seminars in 2009 will have a component in which we will have practical sessions involving the use of dummies for training
8717265 we try to structure the seminars according to the needs and feedback of the participants
8717266 it is not like in darfur where there is hardly any equipment and facilities
8717267 here the hospital network is pretty good but what we need is more training
8717268 now they are wearing suits and they have masks on their faces and many ossetians are coming walking and running from their villages they are destroying everything there
8717269 she was going home walking from gori when she heard about dead people lying in the street
8717270 things have gotten really bad since yesterday 3 00 p m local time when medvedev announced he had signed the recognition
8717271 two thousand more people were expelled but this time not from south ossetia but from georgian villages adjacent to south ossetia
8717272 it looks like the plan is building a barbed wire fence around ossetia and they want adjacent georgian villages with a population of more than 10 000 people they want them out because it probably interferes with their security arrangements
8717273 so far they have deployed 400 personnel and 16 armored vehicles in akhalgori and set up two checkpoints one north of akhalgori and one south
8717274 as yet we do not know whether they have deployed artillery but we know they have deployed short range missiles in south ossetia tochka missiles ss 21 used against gori and poti recently they have put georgia under the permanent military threat of hitting the capital

8717278 you want to make a different movie not just a repeat
8717279 its a different kind of film that the last one its not a disaster movie paradigm
8717280 but we put an injury in there we wanted to make sure that we put it in so he could be protected because hes running around a lot and bashing into things and he needed something to hold it like a sling after his hand surgery so we wrote it into the script to explain it away
8717281 i think theres an expectation that there will be a deeper mythology where the transformers came from
8717282 the key is not to get so mired in the mythology that it cant propel the movie forward we just touched the tip of the iceberg
8717283 monopolies have been allowed to form stifling competition consumer choice and indigenous growth of the software industry in aotearoa new zealand

8717285 this employment first represents a great step in our air forces ability to deliver precise effects across the spectrum of combat
8717286 the first combat employment of this weapon is the validation of the exacting hard work of an entire team of professionals who developed tested and fielded this weapon on an extremely short timeline based on an urgent needs request we established in the combat zone
8717287 we have consistently used precision guided weapons to engage stationary threats with superb combat effects
8717288 this weapon allows our combat pilots to engage a broad range of moving targets with dramatically increased capabilities and it increases our ability to strike the enemy throughout a much much broader engagement envelope
8717289 from the experts in our air force materiel command who shaped our requirements then developed tested and fielded the weapon to our aircraft maintainers our munitions airmen and weapons loaders and everyone in between they made the operational employment of this weapon possible
8717290 and finally our f 16 pilot accurately and precisely delivered and guided the weapon to desired weapons effects the disabling and destruction of an enemy vehicle and personnel
8717291 the national police a force that had an unacceptable reputation and performance less than 15 months ago is now the iraq police force of choice
8717292 it is a security force composed of iraqis for iraqis
8717293 is illustrative of the commitment made by the government of iraq to provide security and stability to their citizens
8717294 so that they continue to be well trained well equipped and serve as a professional and credible force that iraqi citizens can count on
8717295 together we will build on the successes of the past so we continue to progress in the future

8717303 who is responsible for betraying the judiciary zardari is zardari is
8717304 and it is unfortunate that the democratic forces that are in power today they unfortunately are bent upon validating the actions of pervez musharraf
8717305 besides sanctions he also said we will attack ukraine moldova and the crimea this is diseased imagination
8717306 france does not have a diseased imagination france was part of events in georgia and in russia where it fulfilled its work as european union president we do not want to halt the dialogue with russia absolutely not and france does not propose introducing sanctions
8717307 snmg1 as a standing core element of the nato response force is conducting a pre planned routine visit to the black sea region to interact and exercise with our nato partners romania and bulgaria which is an important feature of our routine planning in order to maintain high levels of interoperability and cohesion within the alliance
8717308 in the past our engineers have ridden to war in the back of a dump truck
8717309 where do we want the marine corps to be in 2020 with its vehicle complement based on what we think the threat will be at that point
8717310 weve got some good reports in recent weeks and months on the progress of efv
8717311 we certainly want to mate with the army on any program for the joint light tactical vehicle but i think its fair to say both services are still waiting for that technological breakthrough thats going to give us the amount of soldier and marine protection in a vehicle that is lighter than whats on the market right now
8717312 there is just not an apparent technological breakthrough in ceramics or in carbon fiber thats going to give us that lightweight technology that gives equal protection
8717313 working side by side with the republic of georgia and international organizations u s european command is providing immediate life saving support and restoring essential life support systems as part of a coordinated interagency effort
8717314 the usaid funded feeding programs are taking care of those people who are on the move and headed back to their homes
8717315 they are the ones that are doing the delivering primarily in the tbilisi area where many persons were displaced but its also going into other areas as well within the republic of georgia
8717316 we have to get it right so we can help people quickly
8717317 we want to optimize the humanitarian aid effort and bring in the right stuff to the right place at the right time
8717318 every item delivered was requested by usaid and validated by the government of georgia
8717319 it is fortunate to us that the dallas happened to be in the european theater
8717320 this is the kind of thing for which the coast guard has a great deal of experience and were proud to have them as part of the 6th fleet team thats providing this assistance
8717321 the powder is fda approved and is already being used for hernia repairs and other applications
8717322 but it has never been used for this reason in people
8717323 this is a topic the army and department of defense are interested in because when injuries happen in war most of them are extremity injuries
8717324 with burns in particular we commonly end up with loss of digits
8717325 since the powder was fda approved and safe for use we figured we would try it
8717326 the idea was out there that it might work for this application but it had never been tried on humans
8717327 when put onto open wound it seems the body starts to regrow normal tissue
8717328 you pull a tail off a salamander and it regrows
8717329 the end of the tail forms what is called a blastema and that blastema elongates we think thats what happens when we put this powder on
8717330 this process of growing your fingers has happened to you before in your mothers womb
8717331 the code is there the dna is there what were trying to do is trick your body into doing that again
8717332 thats why were testing it on fingers vs legs if we apply it to a leg amputee the downside is the soldier wont be able to walk for several months and it may not work
8717333 the first time we saw an increase in length of the finger but the wound closed before further growth could occur
8717334 but were not sure how long it will take or if it will even work
8717335 if we have a soldier who was blown up by an ied and missing fingers and we have a chance to give him his fingers back increase his function how can we not try
8717336 the european union has firmly condemned russias unilateral decision to recognize the independence of these two territories abkhazia and south ossetia this decision which presupposes a unilateral change to georgias borders is quite simply unacceptable
8717337 we are confident that the position of the sco member states will have a proper international resonance
8717338 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify the aggression that was committed
8717339 china expresses concern over the latest developments in the situation in south ossetia and abkhazia
8717340 alleges that atrocities were meted out on the south ossetian population russia or south ossetia must document whether this is the case and to what extent
8717341 the fact that china has its own separatist problems certainly in xinjiang province and in tibet especially makes it a very sensitive topic and chinas always been very antiseparatist
8717342 the precedent of giving such support to the georgian separatist regions and potentially offering them independence or even union with russia would be something that would be very sensitive for china indeed
8717343 the area around the ferghana valley is a mismatch of various pockets of ethnicities within the states especially the large uzbek populations within kyrgyzstan and tajikistan
8717344 the fear for these central asian states is the precedent set in perhaps offering independence to abkhazia or south ossetia and support for them could kick start something in this region
8717345 the united position of sco members will have international resonance
8717346 today we have a duty of further expanding the position of the sco on the international scene establishing contacts and expanding cooperation with european structures including the eu and the osce which have recently shown increasing interest in our region
8717347 installing a new government could demotivate the security sector reform process if we say well reform and then nothing happens that will be very dangerous
8717348 guinea bissau has more generals than africas most populous nation nigeria
8717349 many members of the military and the police havent been paid in two months
8717350 you dont want military officers having to sell coffee in the streets to survive thats a recipe for disaster
8717351 drug trafficking is a big threat here and it will undermine everything we do to build peace here if it is not tackled
8717352 key people such as the ministers of defence and of justice have not changed and the new government has given assurance that it will not change ongoing plans
8717353 security sector reform alongside good governance and building up the governments administrative capacity is a pre condition for everything the un does here
8717354 anything that would improve the effort toward peace contribute toward peace will be a welcome development it will help a lot in our effort to pursue the peaceful resolution of the mindanao problem
8717355 we are still confident and right now the peace talks have yet to be broken down not yet
8717356 it is necessary to consider an appropriate response to these dangerous and reckless attempts by russia in the short medium and long term
8717357 with schnittkes music we are possibly standing at the end of the great symphonic route from mahler to shostakovich
8717358 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare to candidate mccain
8717359 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral
8717360 candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote
8717361 are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8717362 when john mccain stood on the deck of an aircraft carrier just three months after 9 11 and proclaimed next up
8717363 how insulting to suggest that those who question the mission question the troops
8717364 how pathetic to suggest that those who question a failed policy doubt america itself
8717365 how desperate to tell the son of a single mother who chose community service over money and privilege that he doesnt put america first barack obamas patriotism
8717366 john kerry descended into a parody of himself tonight when he explained that he was actually for john mccain before he was against him
8717367 claramente n o se trata de uma obra de arte mas de uma blasf mia e de um degradante peda o de lixo que deixou muitas pessoas indignadas
8717368 barack obama discursa hoje no encerramento da conven o democr tica e n o esquecer a efem ride faz hoje 45 anos que martin luther king proferiu o c lebre discurso em que desafiava os americanos a abra ar o seu sonho de igualdade
8717369 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels
8717370 this means the benefits of the diet a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them continue to outweigh the risks
8717371 there is a hugely beneficial extortion system going on here the party needs these companies to sponsor these events to contribute to the festive atmosphere and the companies cant afford to say no since theyre looking at big issues coming up against them next year
8717372 it is an opportunity for them to build relationships or just to confirm good relationships with members of congress
8717373 to help position the industry to not be swept along on that tidal wave
8717374 no matter who gets elected i think were going to have some moderate and very useful and very important reform
8717375 op veel plaatsen kan er vrijwel niets worden gedaan om dammen en waterkeringen weerstand te laten bieden tegen een wervelstorm
8717376 tegen de vrouw heb ik van meet af aan gezegd dat ik geen advocaat meer ben ik heb een advocaat voor haar gezocht die met ons kantoor wilde samenwerken voor haar zaak

8717389 jamaicans deserted the streets and government offices closed as a strengthening tropical storm gustav took aim at the island on thursday on a path toward the gulf of mexico oil fields as a powerful hurricane louisiana gov bobby jindal put new orleans residents on alert for possible evacuations from friday the third anniversary of katrinas strike
8717390 mindful of the pitfalls of hosting cocktail parties while gulf coast residents are being evacuated john mccains campaign suggested thursday that republicans could postpone their upcoming national convention in st paul if tropical storm gustav makes landfall over the weekend
8717391 suggested the georgia war had been cooked up in washington to create a neo cold war climate that would strengthen john mccains bid for the white house and wreck the prospects of barack obama
8717392 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict to make the situation more tense and create a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8717393 justice lawyers said they would go to court as soon as today to block a ruling by u s district judge john d bates that forces the white house to cooperate with a congressional investigation into the politically charged firing of nine u s attorneys in 2006
8717394 experts said the tug of war also seemed unlikely to be resolved before january when the subpoenas legally expire that would confront the new congress with the decision whether to renew the battle
8717395 zeer onwenselijk dat twee distributeurs van schoolboeken 80 procent van de markt in handen hebben de partij eist opheldering van de eigen staatssecretaris van onderwijs van bijsterveldt
8717396 het is een plaatje waar we trots op kunnen zijn
8717397 it was a temptation to make changes but i studied the game against australia in durban and i felt we werent too bad
8717398 if we lose three in a row how can you change that winning and losing are the same thing to me its just that winning is much nicer
8717399 people say we want to play a peter de villiers style of rugby what the devil is that let me explain it to you
8717400 there was a time when we were isolated due to apartheid but when we came back what we didnt do was look at where we were strong instead we copied the model of the australians and became more structured we thought that was the only model available
8717401 we just need to add a component to our game we need players making decisions and playing the situation
8717402 its been very difficult players are so used to playing onto each other its a new thing to be making split second decisions with this kind of game comes responsibility i know its hard for the players because they then have to take responsibility for what they do
8717403 but whatever decision they make i will support the players even though i wont always agree with that decision
8717404 just being a part of the whole scene has been awesome
8717405 its been great having mick byrne and mike cron there from the kicking catching scrum kinds of things a lot of things in the past i havent really thought a lot about every little detail is magnified at that level so you have got to work at it
8717406 now i think i can see the benefits in it definitely
8717407 the whole preparation we do as a team helps you get ready for it i guess you can never be fully ready until you go out there and do it
8717408 all the boys were hurting and obviously you cant escape hearing a bit about it in the media it was pretty easy to get up for it and make it right the preparation did itself really
8717409 before the ball was kicked off there was a different feeling about the team it just felt like there was going to be a different story and it ended up being like that a lot of it is just attitude
8717410 it was good to get a couple of starts and good to have a win last weekend against waikato its been really good good fun
8717411 we just want to keep on rolling and get another one this week
8717412 i think his proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer
8717413 she never has and i doubt that she ever will
8717414 i wouldnt vote for john mccain if he was a democrat
8717415 i would not vote at all before id vote for him
8717416 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
8717417 im not a loser with too much time on my hands like you people
8717418 i will not tell you that you cant run but i will give you two choices 1 start running and come and see me two times a week for the next 4 to 6 months 2 hold off the running until youre healed and stronger and see me two times a week for the next 4 to 6 weeks
8717419 the opportunity to integrate u2 and live nations vision of the future is a great extension to our established business
8717420 if any one were asked to give an americanism without a moments delay he would be more likely than not to mention i guess inquiry into it would at once bear out the american contention that what we are often rude enough to call their vulgarisms are in fact good old english i guess is a favourite expression of chaucers but although it is good old english it is not good new english
8717421 i am extremely grateful to the airlines for agreeing with the vfw that dropping the fee was the right decision to make for our troops
8717422 a 100 is a huge out of pocket expense to someone who doesnt earn very much
8717423 and thats why this luggage fee waiver is so important our troops can now properly focus on their mission instead of remembering to complete a travel voucher in a war zone
8717424 we are aware of this bug and plan to deliver a fix in the next software update she said
8717425 for now users can avoid the problem by changing their setting so that double clicking the home button goes to home or ipod
8717426 ellisons compensation was already sky high and didnt need to go higher
8717427 the company is hiding behind the fact that they did well in the past year
8717428 it was an honor to receive this last year and its an honor to receive it this year thank you very much
8717429 i was fortunate enough to have joe tiller hire me twice
8717430 working for joe at two different places really three if you count washington state as a graduate assistant hes had a huge influence on me
8717431 glen mason bob stoops jim wacker though hes gone now he died in 2003 obviously r c who is a guy i talk to quite frequently hes seen a whole lot more football than ive seen i talk to him quite frequently ive been lucky to have been around some good football coaches
8717432 ill never forget how i first came to know kevin
8717433 you have all these top 100 lists that people put in the paper and you see where a kid is considering a amp m texas oklahoma or whatever
8717434 well i kept seeing purdue as one of the choices
8717435 someone was doing a pretty good job of creating interest in that school purdue kevin sumlin was that guy
8717436 if you wait people start saying that you cant hire anybody that youre having problems assembling a staff
8717437 we werent having problems its communicating and trying to get things the way you want them you want quality people but you also want people who want to be there who have a reason and a purpose to be there
8717438 kevin understands that there is no substitute for hard work
8717439 thats really where success begins for any program if you combine that with his grasp on recruiting and the fact that he will be recruiting the houston area youve got a versatility that is positive for that university
8717440 i finally get to go outside and coach these guys
8717441 it takes a different type of person to want to go out in 100 degree heat and hit guys for two hours
8717442 but this is the happiest ive been so far its football season
8717443 it limits the amount of voices that the public will hear in media
8717444 less emphasis will be put on local news and that the further downsizing of newsrooms will mean less investigative reporting on important issues like elections war the environment and economic issues
8717445 bisher haben wir lediglich ber minimalforderungen diskutiert erkl rte der rzte vertreter
8717446 ik denk dat we gewonnen hebben omwille van de unieke mix tussen gezonde sociale controle en harde inbraakpreventieve maatregelen het heeft immers weinig zin om een alarm te laten afgaan als je buren er niet op reageren daarom is een goed contact met je buren zo cruciaal
8717447 are people who have gone into debt and basically put their lives on hold to make their film
8717448 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
8717449 what if my sign said i love kittens would i be threatened with arrest
8717450 we are proud to bring you a commercial free experience
8717451 well jeff this is a commercial movie theater of course they are going to run ads before the film
8717452 i know that everton are a big club who have a history of playing in important competitions like the uefa cup
8717453 a dispute took place and our officers responded to the hotel we are told hotel guests became upset by the loud outbursts no charges were filed but additional officers were called to help control congressman conyers wife monica
8717454 i dont know if she was yelling a little bit or not
8717455 we know that the councilwoman is very passionate and shes not a pushover that we can say and when youre in that kind of situation that many people around shuffled from one room to another and someone comes up thats out of the loop and says youre going to be out of here i would imagine that you would be a little upset
8717456 people want change they desperately need change but they just cant accept that voting for a black man named barack obama is the only way to make that change
8717457 manny pacquiao is considered the best fighter in boxing today and i always want to fight the best
8717458 i am glad we were able to make this fight happen because while pacquiao is at the pinnacle of his success and has defeated all of the top fighters he has faced i am going to show the world that it stops with me december 6 cant get here soon enough
8717459 my focus is on my training and my next fight
8717460 im not going to talk or think about retirement well see how i feel after this fight for now i have to focus on my training
8717461 when i take that walk to the ring to fight oscar i will carry all the people of the philippines the entire country on my shoulders
8717462 i promise i will fight with all of my heart and that i will give everything i have like my trainer freddie roach says i have what it takes to win the biggest fight of my life
8717463 i am faster and stronger than him and im also younger hes bigger in height but i feel im stronger and its going to be a great fight
8717464 i have to figure out a way to pull the trigger and increase my speed i have quite a task in front of me its going to be an explosive fight thats for sure
8717465 i have no intention of taking it easy in the gym because this will be the fastest strongest southpaw ive ever faced
8717466 i know for a fact that i havent been given the nod
8717467 im disgusted that people players media would think that nick faldo would be that unprofessional to have done such a thing a week before a number of different scenarios could unfold
8717468 its pathetic that people can even think thats the case hes a professional hes been a professional the last 30 years of his career and hes not going to start changing now
8717469 i told him basically that my decision is to stay here and play and i got the best answer i could have possibly got off a captain which was youve got to do whats right for you
8717470 thats the most respectful thing i could have possibly wanted to hear from a captain
8717471 i really dont need to get into the monty discussion of he seems to think ive got a hotline the fact is i know nick and ive been fairly friendly with nick since ive come on tour
8717472 i shouldnt stop that fact just because hes ryder cup captain i dont need to get in the discussion of montys discussions hes got enough work to do this week to try to make the side himself he should just be getting his head down and trying to play good golf
8717473 there are a lot of emotions going about comments from players that i dont think should have been said to be honest
8717474 i think were all professional enough to understand everybodys situation and professional enough to understand everybodys schedules and we should be professional enough to understand peoples decisions
8717475 if you look at my statistics over the last 12 months in relation to the other names that have been put in the potential wild card pick choice im 70 points in the world rankings ahead of paul casey and darren clarke
8717476 ive played well this year and thats all i could have done i dont feel that i just have to go back for that one golf tournament to prove my point
8717477 i said last year that the greens were awful and something needed to be done
8717478 im not a bad putter and i cant remember the last time i three putted from 18 inches
8717479 at the end of the week unfortunately the tournament could be won or lost by luck on the greens
8717480 they are the people i feel really sorry for there is a lot riding on that
8717481 they are going to be feeling pressure as it is and you dont want to be standing over a three footer with so much doubt in your mind not knowing if the ball is going to run straight
8717482 you cant bring the ryder cup onto greens like this hopefully they will rip them up and re do them
8717483 hopefully they wont use the same designer who had two goes at doing the seventh i think my kids could come up with a better design than that in one afternoon
8717484 the greens are not overly smooth but i felt i was a little bit unlucky every time i hit it in the rough i got a bad lie
8717485 i dont think ive blown myself out of it i could have done but i didnt
8717486 even if someone has to cart me into the car on sunday and ive done all i can i can be pleased and proud of myself
8717487 weve had an awful lot of rain they had to close the practice range a couple of times last week
8717488 it has been a difficult summer and specifically the last three weeks have been extremely challenging with rainfall recorded at 205mm compared to the average total montly figure for august of 86mm
8717489 a strong agronomy plan has been formulated for the pga centenary course and is still work in progress
8717490 he plays far too openly so hell have to change but im sure he will do hell learn that he has to adapt
8717491 for the crowd and for the fans back at home its nice to see someone wind up and have a go
8717492 you dont mind taking shots on when its 50 50 but he was taking shots on which were 20 80 in his favour
8717493 i felt as if i was hitting the ball well but i missed a couple of balls i couldnt really believe
8717494 im happy though the conditions out there were first class ive criticised them in the past but i hold my hands up because theyve been superb it was good to get over the line
8717495 i didnt want the interval to come he mark had time to regroup and it showed in the second session
8717496 mark fought his way back into the match rather than me making mistakes he showed what hes capable of in those three frames he won
8717497 he is such a tricky guy to play against he is very good at the net
8717498 it was a tricky match and i knew it was going to be tough but i am glad i came through
8717499 i think everyone feels a bit of pressure in those tense moments
8717500 there were two blood stains noted the first was in the area of where sarah a widmers head was lying the second blood stain was coming from her vaginal area
8717501 i am going to tell your mom if you dont do this
8717502 i love you im going to blow up your school
8717503 instead of their shame my people will receive a double portion and instead of disgrace they will rejoice in their inheritance and so they will inherit a double portion in their land and everlasting joy will be theirs
8717504 those of you who tell me nothing has changed id like to tell you to come walk in my shoes
8717505 i dont see how people who went through all these amazing blockbusters like the dark knight and iron man this summer will take it

8717601 its because of the respect we have for them and the enormity of the challenge we have in front of us trying to win back to back south african test matches and in johannesburg for the first time in so long that we feel we need to bring in some fresh legs
8717602 last weekend took a lot out of our guys as it did some of theirs we will need the impetus that the fresh legs weve included today will bring
8717603 saturday still has huge significance in terms of momentum in the tri nations but also as far as the development of our group as a whole is concerned
8717604 by winning in durban last weekend we have presented ourselves with an opportunity to win back to back test matches in south africa which is not only rare in an australian context but also historically significant across the game in general
8717605 the peter de villiers game plan is all about adding decision making to structure and we are stuck at the moment at decision making
8717606 but i back the players and i want them to keep going out and playing whats in front of them the win will come because we have very good players
8717607 we dont have control over whether we win or lose and i treat winning or losing as the same
8717608 but we let the public down last week and we want them to feel part of a winning recipe
8717609 we certainly wont be doing anything different during the week than we usually do
8717610 maybe if youre so shallow that the only thing you can about is money then yeah i guess

8717649 im proud of you your selfless act of running into a burning house to rescue three small children without regard for your personal safety is remarkable because of your heroism a family grieves only a lost structure rather than a lost child
8717650 i said it just doesnt look right and i have to go in there
8717651 i stopped our vehicle and left her right in the middle of the road
8717652 i walked up to the people sitting on the porch and told them their house was on fire
8717653 they gave me a funny look like what are you talking about i told them to look up and then they could see the smoke coming out of the attic i told them to get off the porch
8717654 i had to ask her who was in the house
8717655 she said the kids and without knowing how many i took off i found two of them watching television they were scared because i was a stranger in their home saying their house was on fire i asked if there was anybody else in the house and one said yes my little brother is taking a nap
8717656 so i went to the room with the closed door and there was the 5 year old i picked him up as we were walking out the door he woke up because i was a stranger he started hitting me screaming and crying by now the smoke was thick and i could hardly see or breathe i had to lean forward to get some air but we made it out the front door
8717657 i looked back at the house just as the roof collapsed and flames shot out the front door like fire out of a dragons mouth this was all in about five or so minutes had we not moved we would have all been burned or grandma would have decided she wanted something else from the house
8717658 then the fire trucks started rolling in the fire trucks spent the next 90 minutes fighting the flames
8717659 before i left i walked over to the grandmother and i told her i was sorry for her loss
8717660 by then she was surrounded by her family she looked at her kids and said hes the one who saved my life if it had not been for him we would have all been burned he is my angel we all became emotional
8717661 god sent me to that family that day because they were in need
8717662 the grandmother never knew my name and i never knew her name but i guess it was an instinct that led us to each other that day i still remember it as though it were yesterday i can close my eyes and picture it i tossed and turned that night after watching it on the news
8717663 our girls took state without ever taking first place in any individual event or relay
8717664 it is probably one of the most team centered championships we have won where we did not have just one outstanding person
8717665 our girls like each other and they get along and that is what makes girls athletics work so well
8717666 i have great assistant coaches in javier chavez lisa reed and mark blanchart said joe loffredo saint joseph head track and field coach
8717667 i also tell the girls if you show up to practice good things will happen we have a young team and are looking forward to a good year next year we need to pick up a couple of more sprinters we gave a good all around team in the field events of shot put long jump discus which really helped us this year laura moll jackie bafford and sarah paur helped us get more points in the field events
8717668 i watched him throw and said he would make a great shot put thrower
8717669 our data seems to point toward the inherent decision that is made when the tumor is formed whether it is highly malignant or not moreover since the characteristic might be dependent on the normal cell status one might imagine that they might be different between individuals
8717670 this does suggest that cells can sit for a long time then be activated
8717671 but these cells were injected into the circulation normal breast cells are not supposed to be in the circulation
8717672 cells that did not have any oncogenes in them and do not transform spontaneously as per all published studies we could see little colonies of these cells when we inspected the lungs
8717673 at no point never did we see a solid vision that would resemble metastatic colonies but it appears that every time we looked at the animal the colonies appeared to be larger
8717674 the running tradition started with the graduating class of 2004 at saint joseph elementary school which was the first class who had an eighth grade
8717675 chavez helped coach at the grade school at that time
8717676 we start conditioning in the first part of july and run about three days a week
8717677 then we start running five days a week during august when school starts we run three days a week at 5 45 a m and the other two days we run after school the students would rather run in the morning and have the afternoon to do their homework we have used this strategy for at least 10 years
8717678 all the 1a high schools do not have cross country teams so we go to the cross country invitationals at all the 2a 5a schools until the regional tournament
8717679 im going to do what i can to help out
8717680 he loves to eat at ottavios restaurant the food there is so good we had it brought down here for this celebration and gastronomy provided the dessert and the bartenders
8717681 he said he used to sit on the step and wait for his father to come of course his father never came but as a priest he would compare his father to god who never leaves us
8717682 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
8717683 based on the available information and reports it appears that this outbreak is over
8717684 by early august the number of cases was down to the number of cases we would expect to see anyway in the absence of a major outbreak there are some cases of this infection that occur every year
8717685 this is also an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8717686 in addition tomatoes were possibly a source particularly early in the outbreak
8717687 as a result of that initiative the fda has identified shipments of produce from mexico which tested positive for strains of salmonella other than the salmonella saintpaul strain
8717688 in cases where contamination was discovered on imported produce the fda has refused the entry and has imposed appropriate import controls on a shipper specific basis to prevent the entry of contaminated product into the u s market
8717689 these foods include certain types of fresh produce that have been repeatedly associated with adverse health events
8717690 that its thoroughly civilized and american like expression would contrast favorably with the mormon towns of southern utah
8717691 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
8717692 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and smoking and whether dietary cadmium or other non cigarette sources may also influence lung function
8717693 the judge memorial catholic high school boys tennis team had not won a state title since 1981
8717694 they won the 2008 state championship title may 17 at liberty park where all the tennis tournaments are played
8717695 at the state tournament juan diego had three singles players a semi finalist and a quarter finalist in the doubles which gave us enough points to win the state title
8717696 over the four years she played her accumulative record was 80 wins and one loss she is now playing for brigham young university
8717697 my number two player was paige miles as a junior last year miles is a senior this year and is the team captain last year miles accumulative record for three years was 65 wins and no losses miles is being heavily recruited this year by fresno state university santa clara university the university of oregon the university of san francisco all the local universities and more colleges she would like to go to a college in california
8717698 last year we had number one doubles shoko kim and rachel claudius who were semi finalists in the number one doubles match claudius is again playing number one doubles for juan diego
8717699 blake holding played number two doubles with davis last year
8717700 this year we are very strong at singles again we hope to take the doubles teams as far as we can and we are looking forward to a very good season
8717701 she has been playing since she was in the second grade so she has had a lot of experience she is very enthusiastic and very positive as far as a person she contributed a lot to the team i would have her help me work a lot with the team on drills and work with team members individually
8717702 jones would help me with the other players and then when it was time for the state finals i would spend time with just her
8717703 that proved to be a very workable situation i would take time with her to work on certain shots and she was able to enhance her game and play more aggressively
8717704 we actually had two people go all the way to win individual titles
8717705 jones was one and our second doubles team won that gave us enough points to become co champions with the rowland hall girls tennis team it was very exciting because we had not won in 27 years so it was a big deal as well as for jones to win back to back individual championship titles
8717706 the judge memorial catholic high school boys tennis team had not won a state title since 1981
8717707 they won the 2008 state title championship may 16 17
8717708 they were really a dark horse team because they did not win the region championship
8717709 we lost to park city high school in the region tournament when we got into the state tournament because of the way they set up the draw you do not know whom you will play but we were able to win the tournament
8717710 going into the second day which was the semi finals and finals we were in a three way tie with park city and logan high schools logan was the defending champion
8717711 we had noel hollingsworth who was our number one singles player in the semi finals
8717712 our number one doubles team was the only team that did not make it into the second round of the tournament
8717713 that was kolby newton and sean mccoy the young man who was killed in an accident this summer
8717714 our number two doubles team was david may and lucien taillac may and lucien were losing and came back and won their match may was hurt and needed ice bags on his shins
8717715 to win the state title is a total points system
8717716 every match we won contributed points to an overall total it was exciting because we were not expected to win because we did not win our region
8717717 it had the statue of saint francis in the corner a staircase in the entrance and a pretty tower
8717718 it still makes me sad when i pass by it but the people didnt fit in there anymore
8717719 the building didnt have a sound structure it would have cost over a million dollars to make the structure sound and it would still be small and we could not expand it
8717720 we waited several months but there was always a glitch in the system
8717721 i have sold the property around 21 times but they have all fallen through
8717722 we have three houses residential zone and a 3 4 acre commercial zone
8717723 we had a huge cinco de mayo celebration with food games and music and a lot of meat we literally had a ton of meat
8717724 we are here on saturday from 9 in the morning until 8 30 at night we are here on sunday too from 9 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon

8718095 since when are major party hacks concerned about excluding minor parties from the ballot
8718096 you make the party primary system sound downright fair and equitable but surely you are aware that the best scenario for an independent or minor party candidate is a non partisan election
8718097 and why should the voters pay for closed partisan primaries
8718098 open primaries became a national issue in this presidential election campaign because independents were allowed to vote in some states but not in others and most voters feel thats unfair
8718099 partisan politics whether its major party or minor party is on the way out
8718100 open primaries is important for independent voters to be able to participate in elections in a meaningful way
8718101 a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush

8718103 theyre making an assumption that one marker is telling the story of the school and it is not
8718104 if a school is on the list dont assume that school is failing look underneath that signal and see the progress they are making

8718107 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary

8718112 to pass a law that helps keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
8718113 but i was proudest i was proudest when i watched him spontaneously focus the attention of the nation on the shameful neglect of americas wounded warriors at walter reed army hospital

8718116 every game is a big game but thursday is a big chance for us to showcase nationally what we certainly hope to be about as a football program
8718117 the biggest challenge without a doubt is i feel like when people havent had a lot of success a lot of times theyre scared of success we cant be a university thats scared of success
8718118 i like to walk down paths nobody else wants to
8718119 people are just throwing names and number out there before anything has happened
8718120 before you even play a down of football you feel like you should be handed a trophy
8718121 i think being on both ends of the spectrum has really helped us stay grounded we know that we cant let that stuff get to us

8718151 people from the georgian security agencies asked me to block russian sites there were threats from viruses we faced disinformation and so on i hope that when war is over we will unblock these sites
8718152 we know that the russian government controls those servers theoretically if they have not been pwned by somebody else
8718153 the internet has become a battleground in which information is the first victim on the one side the main georgian isps severed access to russian websites on the other side georgian government websites were attacked by russian hackers with newspapers and radio and tv stations putting out very little independent news the internet is a vital tool for the public so these attacks must stop at once
8718154 we believe that phone tapping powers are an important law enforcement tool for our police
8718155 we also believe they are highly intrusive and should be subject to the appropriate checks and balances
8718156 the number of applications is going to rise significantly so the pim is going to need more resources and it also needs the power to enter the monitoring rooms to ensure police and the cmc are complying with the laws
8718157 well targeted phone tapping might actually be less intrusive than listening devices installed into houses that can only pick up one end of a conversation

8718279 if the burning of tax dollars were a viable source of energy for america the gangs plan would be worthy of consideration but make no mistake this is not an energy plan its a blueprint for new federal taxes and spending sprees for the sake of consumers and our economy we had hoped that support for this proposal would go in the other direction with winter around the corner and more than 100 million american households facing record setting home heating costs the growth in support for this plan is disappointing
8718280 a common sense energy plan would yield the taxpayer an abundance of new domestic energy supplies and billions in revenue to the federal treasury it would lift the arbitrary restrictions that have kept billions of barrels of american oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas off limits during times of dire need unfortunately the gangs plan promises to do no such thing in exchange for a hint new production in the future this plan spends roughly 85 billion on taxpayer funded pork projects and handouts to the auto industry and worst of all puts the ban on offshore drilling into permanent law for the first time ever

8718338 this was a surprisingly strong report that should end the discussion about a recession at least for now
8718339 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states

8718341 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it just sounds not rational

8718387 death toll in afghanistan had reached 580 as many as 105 had been killed in 2008 alone including sixty five in may july the worst period since the war started in october 2001 see jason straziuso
8718388 10 august 2008 while sixty four people were killed in a double bombing of one of pakistans largest munitions factories see jane perlez
8718389 4 april 2003 that was indeed the outcome and an american insistence on remaining in iraq whatever the nouri al maliki government may want means that iraq may yet come to the fore in this role again for now though the focus moves on or more correctly back to afghanistan
8718390 an apparent us victory achieved before the end of the year may in reality be just a further stage in a longer term civil war in afghanistan this is supported by the likelihood that many taliban and al qaida units have already crossed the border into north west pakistan where there is substantial local support for their position

8718409 i have started to swing the bat good although i am hitting balls right at people as long as you barrel it up there is nothing else you can really do i am happy with what is going on
8718410 those balls you think you hit hard you really dont
8718411 metal bats sort of give you a false sense of success sometimes you get jammed with a metal bat you may still hit it hard but here youll break it in half as long as you barrel it up you should be okay there is a different sweet spot on the bat so you have to learn how to hit with that and hit balls out front
8718412 i dont like the first round now i went through the draft my senior year in high school and they just shot them out every thirty seconds or so this year was long and i was kind of more experienced and just waited and didnt get too excited because i know anything can happen on draft day i just waited to hear my name and i was excited to go in the first round
8718413 i think they really like that i am here with him he made the same transition as he was a shortstop all the way until his first day in the big leagues when they told him he was going to play third he has really helped me and knows a lot he has been there and knows how it works
8718414 being at the ballpark all day is the toughest adjustment for me

8718423 this is a very complex area with very difficult veterinary and legal issues to be looked at i have asked this expert group to propose measures that will ensure prohibited substances have no part to play in equestrian sport as an industry we must adopt a zero tolerance approach
8718424 it is important that we address all eventualities not just the most recent case unfortunately we have had a number of high profile cases involving horses testing positive and we need to look at the lessons from all of these
8718425 everybody involved with horse sport ireland is asking themselves what more we could have done to prevent this catastrophe however some of the suggestions being put forward are not as straightforward as people think i am confident that this group will give us the best advice to ensure that we take every possible measure to try and avoid this situation occurring again
8718426 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
8718427 a lot of work has been done by the fire service overnight to damp it down and reduce the temperature enough for work to stabilise the structure to begin and make it safe to enter
8718428 once it has been deemed safe which we are hoping will be either this evening or tomorrow uk time specialist search teams and forensic experts will go in
8718429 it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined this is not something which can be done quickly
8718430 once we have access to the house we will find out whether the family was inside at the time of the fire scenes of crime officers have already carried out examinations at the various outhouses
8718431 it is still very important that anyone who might have information which could help our investigation or who might have seen the foster family over the bank holiday before the fire gets in touch
8718432 there has been a lot of speculation in some sections of the media which has caused serious distress to the fosters family and friends
8718433 such speculation is not helpful to our investigation and until we gain access to the house and complete our search and examination we are not in a position to make any further comment on such issues
8718434 we can confirm that on 21 august 2008 three separate attempts were made via a single logon id to access the same data from a single hotel
8718435 the hotel in question is the 107 room best western hotel am schloss kopenick in berlin germany where a trojan horse virus was detected by the hotels antivirus software
8718436 we can also confirm that we have been able to narrow down the number of customers affected by this breach to 10
8718437 we are currently contacting those customers and offering assistance as needed
8718438 purges reservations data within seven days of guest departure thereby limiting potential data exposure
8718439 we got the warning from the antivirus software and after that we turned off the systems and changed the systems
8718440 we cut off our internet connection informed it and turned everything off immediately i dont know the details of the virus it was only 10 people who were affected the clients who were hacked have been informed
8718441 what i found was on one of the top underground forums for the rbn trading network
8718442 there was an indian hacker selling a log in to best westerns systems with a screenshot saying the log in can get access to credit card numbers and card verification codes

8718448 an innovative program to prevent and treat child abuse which is the mission of family resources
8718449 when we see a child having a meltdown or a child standing dangerously in a shopping cart we dont know what to do
8718450 we are all kind of helpless and freeze when we see others in this situation what we want to do is enable people to assist these parents
8718451 the video showed how people could assist parents with their children through gentle intervention
8718452 i came aboard the project in the fall of 2002 when my boys were almost 3 and 5
8718453 we knew it was a great concept but we asked ourselves how can we get everyday people to understand and use this concept
8718454 lets just say that my younger son has always been an intense and loud child i was living it
8718455 i never got to meet him and i wanted to know his thoughts and plans for the program
8718456 what is the first thing you see on the show
8718457 we want people to stop and recognize when they may be able to help a parent or child take a moment to pause think and get ready to assist and three try one kind word to assist
8718458 getting involved may be as simple as standing closer to a shopping cart where a child is standing and in a dangerous situation while the parent is busy with another child
8718459 that was a lot of fun we filmed the video at the giant eagle in the waterworks from midnight to 6 a m here we are filming a video about child abuse and we had children there in the middle of the night
8718460 we had to get all sorts of waivers and special permission to make it
8718461 based on our feedback we can say that we can really impact how people can help parents in difficult situations
8718462 we want it to be a regional showpiece we want to put the message out in our region that one kind word can make a difference to someone
8718463 we have been talking with a major grocery store chain and other places such as museums and amusement parks we feel that anywhere large groups of families with children gather will be the ideal sites for the program
8718464 thats why its so critical looking at gustav if you have a major hurricane go inland it could be a lot worse than katrina was in the city

8718494 neither i nor my vets had ever heard of the drug felbinac until we got the call about myths positive test
8718495 we were stunned and baffled we spent the entire day doing internet research on the uses for this drug and how it could possibly have gotten into my horses system as far as we could find it is not even manufactured approved or available in the us my horse has had no soundness problems whatsoever and i would have no need for an anti inflammatory anyone who knows me knows whole heartedly that i would never dope my horse intentionally it is cheating it is not putting your best against the others best i have never been in a more torturous and frustrating situation trying to prove innocence is very hard it saddens me beyond description that my whole reputation could be blackened because of this situation
8718496 there are circumstances in this case that makes it difficult to clear out how the prohibited substance entered into the horses system
8718497 the usef stands behind the feis initiatives to rid the sport of doping and to protect the welfare of our horses
8718498 we are equally supportive of courtney in this situation as this substance was unknown to any of us until a few days ago it seems clear that mythilus came into contact with it without courtneys or dr mitchells knowledge

8718536 i have a fairly specific idea of what the first 15 pages of the screenplay will be and no idea what will happen on pages 16 through 130 i have very strong feelings about the internet and its effect on our national culture but frankly those feelings are being countered by the sophistication kindness curiosity and wit of the posts in this site
8718537 its not my success its our success i have total trust in gary
8718538 every year you learn more and more about each other

8718548 our first objective is to get to the next phase the second is to try to do so as group b winners
8718549 of course were really motivated and confident we want to start playing the as soon as possible
8718550 for us its great to be welcomed back to the champions league with a classic encounter against real madrid
8718551 but theres also zenit who represent the progression of east european teams our players need to remember that theyre playing at the highest level and that juve are back
8718552 it seems like a good group to me certainly an interesting one
8718553 that team has something extra however weve attained a certain level over the last few years and i think thats something the players should cherish like a treasure

8718562 targeted members of the tufts muslim community for harassment and embarrassment and that muslim students felt psychologically intimidated by the piece
8718563 to fires knowledge such a ruling is unprecedented a university that clearly promises its students a commitment to robust free speech has found a student paper guilty of harassment for publishing verifiable facts if publishing factual statements constitutes harassment then harassment has become the exception that swallows the rule of free speech
8718564 t o protect freedom of expression at tufts i must reverse this aspect of the outcome i leave untouched the remainder of the committees opinion

8718566 they are going to be fantastic games the rivalry is there between england we played against them a couple of years ago and got a victory it promises to be a great atmosphere in both games
8718567 our home form is very good its just our away form that has been very poor if we can get that right it will go a long way to getting through to the next round
8718568 we dont have to travel far and the fixtures have fallen nicely weve got a home game against villarreal inbetween the games against liverpool and chelsea
8718569 i remember the last game at celtic distinctly they beat us to qualify and the atmosphere from their fans was unbelievable they will be two huge games
8718570 its a big one we seem to make a habit of drawing the european champions
8718571 wouldnt it be fabulous if we could get through and meet united later on in the competition
8718572 with our spanish contingent that will be a couple of very big games and there will be a lot of attention focused on those
8718573 theyve got some very good players and if theres one team in the last pot we didnt want to sign it was them

8718585 it was like i transferred schools thats what it felt like
8718586 some positions were changed but i think some things needed to be changed to understand we were under a new system everything that was changed was changed for a reason
8718587 bo had a great vision of what he wanted to have happen we had a program we did a good job sticking with it and we had seniors at the beginning question what was going on as it went on they gained a lot of confidence and matured and had to accept what was happening
8718588 we have to give him a chance like we did with bo when he first got here and all those things were important
8718589 youre always going to have some change and you have to see where it goes he has a good reputation obviously and won in the past so i dont see why he cant win here
8718590 i cant say enough in praise of the beautiful symphonic and choral treatment he created for this piece i think the word masterpiece may actually apply here

8718592 the man was riding a bicycle on one occasion but on each of the other occasions he was on foot

8718598 we will be focused and ready to play the buccaneers
8718599 were planning on that game being at the superdome but the powers that be will have a clear plan in place if that should change any or if our preparation should have to be somewhere else it wont be a distraction we wont allow it to be

8718604 i felt like we were all kind of in this thing together
8718605 im trying to rebuild my career coming off the injury and changing teams kind of a fresh start for me a fresh start for the organization and a fresh start for the city

8718616 lyon will be a hurdle to overcome fiorentina has its attraction because of luca toni it will no doubt be a very exciting affair
8718617 this is a group no one should underestimate but the match against fiorentina will be delicacy for luca toni and our fans
8718618 i would not have preferred to play against a big club like chelsea manchester or arsenal its good to play lyon from my own experience i know what they are like
8718619 i would be a liar if i said we could not solve this task
8718620 we are happy even if the group does not appear spectacular on the first view it is interesting

8718624 this is about mileage the proposal is definitely moving in the right direction
8718625 we are very supportive of the concept of trying to get a more specific way to gather mileage verification information
8718626 the bill allowed insurance companies to require drivers to place the technology in the car or not get the pay as you drive discount

8718637 nosotros tampoco somos representantes de los empresarios nicamente estamos buscando es una salida que para el ministerio de trabajo no es la conciliaci n obligatoria que solicitan algunas empresas sino que pasa por abrir un proceso preventivo de crisis que tiene que ver con que la empresa demuestre realmente las causales por las que despide gente
8718638 ten amos el borrador del procedimiento preventivo de crisis redactado pero a la luz de que estaban reuni ndose en forma privada dentro de la empresa nosotros detuvimos el proceso y ahora como se est n dando los acontecimientos creo que lo vamos a llevar a adelante

8718652 the world is a simple place where children play with toys in a make believe world some of them never grow up and learn how to work with tools primarily their own brains and so remain burdens on society
8718653 these people got loans for what they couldnt afford because a greedy lender was trying to line their own pocket a lot of these people should have been denied the mortgage in the first place
8718654 the pitcher might bunt and if its a good bunt the guy on third might ty to score when we throw to first a good return throw to the plate will get the runner dont make a crappy throw so heads up
8718655 most times a bunt is the catchers call i dont know where the call was or if encarnacion even heard but the catcher has to see soto to far from the bag and let his guy know
8718656 the two terms spiritual and theology keep good company with one another theology is the attention we give to knowing god as revealed in the holy scriptures and in jesus christ spiritual is the insistence that everything that god reveals of himself and his works is capable of being lived by ordinary men and women in their homes and workplaces spiritual keeps theology from degenerating into merely thinking and talking and writing about god at a distance theology keeps spiritual from becoming merely thinking and talking and writing about the feelings and thoughts one has about god the two words need each other for we know how easy it is for us to let our study of god theology get separated from the way we live we also know how easy it is to let our desires to live whole and satisfying lives spiritual lives get disconnected from who god actually is and the ways he works among us spiritual theology is not one more area of theology that takes its place on the shelf alongside the academic disciplines of systematic biblical practical and historical theology rather it represents the conviction that all theology no exceptions has to do with the living god who creates us as living creatures to live to his glory it is the development of awareness and discernments that are as alert and responsive in the workplace as in the sanctuary as active while changing diapers in a nursery as while meditating in a grove of aspens as necessary when reading a newspaper editorial as when exegeting a sentence written in hebrew spirituality begins in theology the revelation and understanding of god and is guided by it and theology is never truly itself apart from being expressed in the bodies of the men and women to whom god gives life and whom god then intends to live a full salvation life spirituality

8718703 success in business requires training and discipline and hard work but if youre not frightened by these things the opportunities are just as great today as they ever were
8718704 this is an environment in which were likely to get a lot of head fakes both on the upside and the downside
8718705 this is just sort of data that trickles out that can be very positive one day and negative the next we dont yet think it signals a trend
8718706 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8718707 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8718708 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8718709 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8718710 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop
8718711 we would much prefer to design a vehicle that provides good protection for unbelted occupants but is tuned specifically to protect occupants that are doing what theyre supposed to be doing
8718712 its very difficult for governments that have had a specific regulation on their books for many years to suddenly decide to change
8718713 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
8718714 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
8718715 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
8718716 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
8718717 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
8718718 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
8718719 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
8718720 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
8718721 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
8718722 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
8718723 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
8718724 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
8718725 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
8718726 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
8718727 i have a strong view the liberals should run in port macquarie
8718728 they should put aside all the personal agendas and egos and get on with it
8718729 the demographics have changed so political parties have to adjust to the game to remain relevant
8718730 its sheer stupidity for the coalition parties to be running against each other at a state level with optional preferential voting
8718731 there is a process to go through and a decision has not been made yet but the door is wide open
8718732 i have a positive outlook and will give 100 per cent to this community

8718742 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8718743 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine
8718744 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything that we can get a good price
8718745 success in business requires training and discipline and hard work but if youre not frightened by these things the opportunities are just as great today as they ever were
8718746 mccain said in an early morning radio interview that he was bringing along to that event both former pennsylvania gov tom ridge and former massachusetts gov mitt romney two of the leading names on his short list but he cautioned against assuming that meant either one would be the pick
8718747 say he has told his inner circle of his pick but wont call the decision official until he has discussed it with his wife cindy who has been in the country of georgia
8718748 after eight or 11 miles it reverts to being a completely normal gasoline electric hybrid which means you get about a 25 30 percent fuel savings but the point is they do burn fuel
8718749 the 2 percent increase in total u s store sales was also more than entirely due to higher spending by customers from other countries
8718750 sales to new yorkers were below last year which should not be too surprising to anyone

8718767 when one of you sees a dream that he likes then it is from allah he should praise allah for it and relate it to others
8718768 he should not report it except to those whom he loves and if he sees one which he dislikes then it is from the satan he should seek refuge in allah against its evil and should not mention it to anyone then it will not harm him al bukhari and muslim
8718769 a good vision dream is from allah and a bad dream is from the satan he who sees something in a dream that he dislikes should blow thrice on his left must seek allahs refuge from the evil of the satann i e by saying audhu billahi minash shaytanir rajim then it will not harm him

8718784 this is a momentous decision and legal victory for women and families in mexico
8718785 in a region where abortion is highly restricted the supreme court has taken a huge leap forward in protecting womens basic human rights todays ruling opens the door for women across the country to demand that their local governments follow mexico citys example
8718786 the ministers that voted against his proposal say there is no place explicitly in the mexican constitution or in international law that says life should be protected from the moment of conception
8718787 they are just encouraging women to be dirty and loose

8718803 establish the islamic state within your own selves then it will be established in your lands
8718804 and that we do not contend with or attempt to take away the command from those assigned with it i
8718805 there are three things towards which the heart of a muslim never shows hatred or rancour 1 making ones action sincerely for the sake of allaah 2 giving obedience to the rulers wulatul amr and 3 sticking to the group jamaaah for verily their supplication encompasses those who are behind them i e those whom they rule over
8718806 o you who believe obey allaah and obey the messenger and those of you muslims who are in authority
8718807 if i had a supplication that would be answered i would not make it except for the leader imaam because when the leader becomes righteous the towns and servants become safe and secure
8718808 o teacher of goodness who would show boldness towards this besides you
8718809 whoever rebels against a muslim ruler is one of the khawaarij has caused dissent within the muslims has contradicted the narrations and has died the death of the days of ignorance
8718810 a group will appear reciting the quraan it will not pass beyond their throats every time a group appears it will be cut off until the dajjaal appears within them
8718811 it is not permissible to fight the ruler or rebel against him even if he oppresses
8718812 it is not fitting for the one who sees the uprising of a khaarijee who has revolted against the imaam whether he is just or oppressive so this person has revolted and gathered a group behind him has pulled out his sword and has made lawful the killing of muslims it is not fitting for the one who sees this that he becomes deceived by this persons recitation of the quraan the length of his standing in the prayer nor his constant fasting or his good and excellent words in knowledge when it is clear to him that this persons way and methodology madhhab is that of the khawaarij
8718813 and as for imaam maalik then ibn al qaasim said
8718814 indeed there are a people who desire worship but squander the knowledge being deprived of it so they revolt against the ummah of muhammad with their swords and if they had followed the knowledge then it would have prevented them from doing that
8718815 whoever desires to advise the one with authority then he should not do so openly rather he should take him by the hand and take him into seclusion and then advise him and if he accepts the advice from him then he has achieved his objective and if not then he has fulfilled that which was a duty upon him
8718816 o aboo saeed what do you say about fighting this oppressor who has unlawfully spilt blood and unlawfully taken wealth and did this and that
8718817 i hold that he should not be fought if this is the punishment from allah then you will not be able to remove it with your swords if this is a trial from allaah then be patient until allaahs judgment comes and he is the best of judges
8718818 if the people had patience when they were being tested by their unjust ruler it will not be long before allaah will give them a way out however they always rush for their swords so they are left to their swords by allaah not even for a single day did they bring about any good
8718819 when you wish to correct the sultan then take him by the hand in secret and advise him
8718820 we revile him and do not love him rather we hate him for allaah he had some some good deed but they are drowned in the ocean of his sins and his affair is for allaah
8718821 renew your hearts with the remembrance of all h because it rushes into forgetfulness you
8718822 is it from the manhaj methodology of the salaf to criticise the rulers from the mimbar the pulpit and what is the manhaj of the salaf with respect to advising the rulers
8718823 it is not from the manhaj of the salaf to publicise the faults of the rulers and to mention such things from the pulpit because that leads to confusion disorder and the absence of hearing and obeying the ruler in what is good
8718824 you think that i will not talk to him without letting you know about it also indeed i will certainly talk to him regarding that which concerns me and him without initiating a matter which i do not love to be the first to initiate
8718825 whoever believes in allah and the last day let him either speak good or keep silent
8718826 they said o messenger of allaah which part of islam is the most excellent he replied it is he from whose hand and tongue the muslims are safe
8718827 i was with aboo bakrah beneath the minbar pulpit of ibn aamir
8718828 be silent i heard the messenger of allaah sallallaahu alaihi wasallam say whoever demeans the sultaan ruler of allaah upon the earth allaah will humiliate him
8718829 the senior amongst the companions of allaahs messenger sallallaahu alaihi wasallam forbade us saying do not revile your rulers umaraa not act dishonestly with them nor hate them and have taqwaa of allaah and be patient for verily the matter is close at hand
8718830 sufyaan ath thawree narrated to us from qais ibn wahb from anas ibn maalik radhiyallahu anhu that he said
8718831 the most senior amongst us from among the companions of allaahs messenger sallallaahu alaihi wasallam forbade us that we should not revile our rulers umaraa nor to be dishonest with them nor to disobey them but to have patience and to have taqwaa of allah the mighty and majestic for verily the matter is close at hand
8718832 the most senior amongst us from among the companions of allahs messenger sallallaahu alaihi wasallam commanded us not to revile our rulers
8718833 mighty is the word that comes from their mouths they utter nothing but a lie
8718834 ibn uyainah narrated to us from ibraaheem ibn maisarah from taawoos who said the rulers were mentioned in the presence of ibn abbaas and a man amongst them began to censure them he continued to arrogate himself standing and stretching out his neck in doing this until i did not see in the house i e the haram a man taller than him then i heard ibn abbaas say do not make yourself a trial for a wrongdoing people then the man constricted himself and i did not see in the house a man shorter than him
8718835 verily the first appearance is the hypocrisy of a man is his censure and rebuke of his ruler imaam
8718836 beware of cursing the rulers wullaat for verily cursing them is clipping i e of the religion and hating them is barrenness
8718837 have patience for verily when allaah sees that from you he will take them away from you with death
8718838 i said to mansoor ibn when i am fasting can i revile the ruler sultaan he said no i then said then can i revile the people of desires i e innovators he said yes
8718839 never do a people revile their ruler ameer except that they are prevented from his goodness
8718840 abdah narrated to us from az zabriqaan who said i was with aboo waail shaqeeq ibn salamah and i began to revile al hajjaaj and mention his faults and bad deeds he aboo waail said do not revile him and what will inform you that perhaps he says 0 allaah forgive me so he forgives him
8718841 beware of censuring and rebuking the rulers aimmah for verily rebuking them is clipping that is the clipping of the deen not the clipping of the hair verily the taaaneen those who rebuke and revile they are the losers and they are the most evil of the evil ones
8718842 by allaah no one is brought to me who curses his ruler imaam except that i till beat him in the haram
8718843 when news of the burning of the house reached me i left for makkah and visited ibn abbaas there frequently until he recognised me and was amicable to me then i reviled al hajjaaj in the presence of ibn abbaas and he said do not be a helper to shaytaan
8718844 i heard abdullah ibn idrees say i will never ever help in the blood of a khaleefah after uthmaan it was said to him 0 aboo mabad did you help in bringing about the shedding of his blood so he said verily i consider tile mentioning of his faults and shortcomings to have been of help in the shedding of his blood
8718845 there are three things towards which the heart of a muslim never shows hatred or rancour making ones action sincerely for the sake of allah giving obedience to the rulers wulaatul amr and sticking to the group jamaaah for verily their supplication encompasses those who are behind them i e those whom they rule over
8718846 whoever desires to advise the one with authority then he should not do so openly rather he should take him by the hand and take him into seclusion and then advise him and if he accepts from him the advice then he has achieved his objective and if not then he has fulfilled that which was a duty upon him
8718847 it is desirable for the one to whom a mistake of the leader imaam appears in certain matters that he advises him but does not openly rebuke him in front of all the people to see rather it should be as has been reported in the hadeeth that he should take him by the hand should take him into seclusion and should offer him the advice and he should not humiliate the sultaan of allaah and we have already said in the beginning of the book of siyar that it is not permissible to revolt against the leaders even if they reach excessive levels of oppression as long as they establish the prayer and no manifest and clear disbelief appears from them and the ahaadeeth that have been reported with this meaning are mutawaathir however it is necessary for the follower that he follows the leader imaam in obedience to allaah and he disobeys him in what entails disobedience to allaah for verily there is no obedience to the creation in disobedience to allaah
8718848 so when speaking about the king by backbiting giving him advice in the open and publicising his faults when that is but humiliation of him that humiliation for which allaah has threatened the one who does it with humiliation and debasement then there is no doubt that it is obligatory to carefully observe what we have mentioned that he should desire to give advice in secret and other such things this being for the ones who are capable of advising them from among the scholars those who visit them and mix with them and by whose advice they find benefit as opposed to those besides the scholars
8718849 for openly opposing the ruler sultaan in that which is not from the necessities of the religion and rejecting that openly in the gatherings in the mosques and in the ranks and other places of admonition and other such things then that is not advice at all so do not be deceived by the one who does that even if it is with good intention for verily that is in opposition to what the salafus saalih those who are to be followed were upon and your guidance is in allaahs control
8718850 this is a great topic containing much benefit and due to ignorance of this topic a great mistake has fallen upon the shareeah
8718851 whoever sees something from his leader ameer something that he dislikes then let him be patient and let him not raise his hand away from the leaders obedience
8718852 and those people those who are under trial do not know that with the exception of umar ibn abdul azeez and whoever allah willed from among the banee umayyah great mishaps insolence taking up arms against the people and corruption occurred from most of those in charge wullaat of the people of islaam from the time of yazeed ibn muaawiyah till the present but along with that the manner and behaviour of the notable scholars and mighty leaders with the rulers is well known and renowned they do not raise a hand against giving obedience in that which allaah and his messenger have commanded from among the legislated actions and obligatory duties of islaam and i will give you an example that of al hajjaaj ibn yoosuf ath thaqafee and his affair is well known in the ummah that of oppression repression excessiveness in spilling the blood of the muslims desecration of the sanctities of allaah the killing of whomever he killed amongst the notables of the umrah such as saeed ibn jubair the besieging of ibn az zubair even though he had sought refuge in the haram and making lawful the sacred and sanctified the killing of ibn az zubair even though ibn az zubair had given obedience to him and the people of makkah medinah yemen and most of lraaq had given the pledge of allegiance to him ibn az zubair and al hajjaaj was only a deputy of marwaan and then of his son abdul malik and none of the khulafaa successors had given marwaan a pledge and none of the influential people those with power had given the pledge of allegiance to him and along with all of this none of the people of knowledge hesitated in obeying him and complying with him in that in which obedience is permissible from amongst the pillars of islaam and its obligations and ibn umar and whoever met al hajjaaj were from amongst the companions of allahs messenger sallallaahu alaihi wasallam and they never contested with him and nor did they prevent obedience to him in that by which islaam is established and by which eemaan is perfected and it is likewise for those who were also in the era of al hajjaaj from among the taabieen such as ibn al musayyib al hasan al basree ibn seereen ibraaheem at taimee and those like them from among the leaders of the ummah and the affair continued like this between the leading scholars of the ummah they would enjoin obedience to allah and his messenger and making jihaad in his path along with every leader imaam whether righteous or sinful as is well known in the books of the fundamental principles and beliefs of the religion and similarly banul abbaas they conquered the lands of the muslims forcefully with the sword and not one of the people of knowledge and religion aided them in that and they killed hordes of people and many of the creation from among the banu umayyab their leaders and their deputies and they killed ibn huhairah the ameer of iraaq and they also killed marwaan the khaleefah and it was reported that the murderers killed around eighty people from banu umayyah in a single clay and then they placed their blankets above the corpses sat upon them and then called for food and drink so along with all of that the conduct of the leading scholars such as al awzaaee maalik al layth ibn sad and ataa ibn abee rabaah with those kings is not hidden from the one who has a share in knowledge and realization and then the next generation of the people of knowledge such as ahmad ibn hanbal muhammad ibn ismaaeel al bukhaaree muhammad ibn idrees ahmad ibn nooh ishaaq ibn raahawaih and their brothers their occurred in their time what occurred from the kings of the great innovations and the denial of the sifaat and they were called to affirm these things and were put to trial by them and whoever was killed was killed such as ahmad ibn nasr but along with all of this it is not known that a single one of them raised his hand against obedience to those kings and that he saw fit to attack them
8718853 when you see a man making a supplication against the ruler sultaan then know that he is a person of desire
8718854 if i had a supplication that would be answered i would not make it except for the ruler
8718855 i was with aboo bakrah beneath the minbar pulpit of ibn aamir he was giving a speech and was wearing a fine garment so aboo bilaal said look at out ameer wearing the garment of
8718856 renew your hearts with the remembrance of all h because it rushes into forgetfulness
8718857 i do not mind which out of the two blessings was greater that allaah guided me to islaam or that he kept me away from these innovated sects

8718860 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8718861 youtube has gone above and beyond the law to protect content owners while empowering people to communicate and share their experiences online
8718862 does nothing to change the fact that youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners google and youtube have engaged in massive copyright infringement conduct that is not protected by any law including the dmca
8718863 the record presented demonstrates that far from encouraging copyright infringement veoh has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its website and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its website
8718864 in sum veoh has met its burden in establishing its entitlement to safe harbor for the alleged infringements here

8718868 it is surprising that a religious school its purported board and the rabbi in charge all have disregarded a hazmanah to a respected beit din
8718869 but it is downright chutzpah that at the same time those individuals have publicly criticized the parents for not bringing the dispute to beit din the truth is that they are the ones who for the past three months have studiously avoided going to beit din

8718873 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8718874 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8718875 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling

8718885 the first quarter proved to be a more difficult business environment than we anticipated a situation that we believe may continue throughout at least a portion of the remainder of our fiscal year our key products and technology continue to deliver compelling solutions but customers are experiencing softening demand in some of their end markets and we believe the first quarter results reflected delays in their purchases of design software as well as changes in our sales channel
8718886 given this assessment of market conditions and recent changes in our sales channel we lowered our full year guidance the new target is consistent with our intent to increase the portion of our revenue based on backlog to 90 percent or more of revenue in future periods

8718938 all of murrays films are independently distributed now that tla offers them our customers have the most varied selection possible
8718939 we love to give our customers as many choices as possible
8718940 my work has focused on the lesser seen parts of glbt culture
8718941 my focus has been so heavy on making the film the challenge of offering the films has been somewhat neglected when tla contacted me about being part of their catalog i was thrilled as an independent filmmaker my work has been largely self funded so sharing these dvds helps to support future projects
8718942 we are always open to working with new voices like t joe murray
8718943 all of t joe murrays films are independently distributed now that tla offers them our customers have the most varied selection possible

8718948 sadly we frequently see patients admitted to a hospital with a devastating stroke who are known to have atrial fibrillation yet were either not taking warfarin or were taking a dose that is not therapeutic
8718949 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
8718950 many stroke survivors believe theres nothing to be gained from further rehabilitation but our results suggest that health and functional benefits from walking on a treadmill can occur even decades out from stroke
8718951 we were not expecting that their website be in braille or that they make any huge changes just that they designed the site in a standard way so our software would work
8718952 lots of other large corporation websites have dealt with this successfully
8718953 they did not want to talk to us about it
8718954 in 2006 many things on the website were accessible to visually impaired people and some were not
8718955 whats important is that we have been working continuously as the website and the technology have improved
8718956 target has made a positive shift to dealing with the problem

8718959 i find it inconceivable that the individual boards are arguing against each other and not focusing on the subject
8718960 weve got to pass this thing education is the most important thing
8718961 i am skeptical that this will end in a way that will be accepted positively by the kennebunkport voters

8718966 he is such a tricky guy to play against he is very good at the net
8718967 it was a tricky match and i knew it was going to be tough but i am glad i came through i think everyone feels a bit of pressure in those tense moments
8718968 the core web rendering engine in ie8 is compliant with web standards but we have also tried to maintain compatibility with sites written specifically for older versions of ie
8718969 at the moment we have to support about four previous versions of internet explorer firefox and safari it always foxes me why different browsers are incompatible
8718970 sites that are specifically written for ie will not display properly
8718971 many people probably will not ever use the compatibility button that microsoft has built into ie8 which means some sites will not work and the user will get a message saying the site needs internet explorer
8718972 we are piling for the first building of the masdar institute of science and technology mist in masdar city
8718973 theyre like a horizontal elevator you just say where you want to go and it takes you there
8718974 carbon is present in the construction materials that are used in building the city the energy that is generated and transportation
8718975 now when it comes to the materials that are used for building the city as we cannot change the basic nature of things we will have to use materials that contain carbon so to achieve the zero carbon target we would need to offset the carbon present in the building materials
8718976 in the choice of materials a seemingly obvious approach would be to only use materials that have low carbon in them but there are many other aspects that need to be considered before finalising the material for instance durability is an important consideration specifically how the material in question will sustain itself over a period of time a material may have a large proportion of carbon in it but if it can make the building last then its carbon footprint is much lower than a material that has very little carbon in it but is not durable in a way durability is our prime concern as with any other project in the region
8718977 once we have weighed other choices and decided on using particular materials for instance using slag or fly ash in concrete then we have to bear in mind the technical requirements of the work at hand to decide on how much slag we need to get the right mix
8718978 when the choice of materials and required quantities are fixed we need to quantify and place on record how much carbon is present in the materials that we are using
8718979 if a truck transports concrete to the masdar city the carbon consumed in manufacturing the truck would not be part of our carbon footprints but just the carbon present in the concrete and its batching and transporting to the site
8718980 we will be offsetting the carbon by adopting green strategies which mainly involve the setting up of extensive nurseries and plantations on the land surrounding the city which will capture the carbon masdar city itself wont be emitting any carbon but will be only offsetting the quantity of carbon present in the building materials the measuring of carbon offset will be done by referring to standard conversion charts which define the quantity of carbon a particular tree or plantation consumes
8718981 electricity will be generated by pv panels while cooling will be provided via concentrated solar power
8718982 masdar chose germany as the site for its first plant because germany is currently the centre of the global pv industry this german plant will act as a reference plant for technology and knowledge transfer to the larger abu dhabi plant by a joint german abu dhabi team
8718983 thin film pv is a key part of our build deploy develop strategy to actively build a strong position in alternative energy
8718984 this marks a major milestone for masdar and abu dhabi it will not only establish masdar as a major global pv player but will be the first high tech semiconductor nano manufacturing facility of its kind in the entire region positioning abu dhabi as a developer and producer of clean technology
8718985 masdar city will require approximately 200 mw of installed clean power versus more than 800 mw of installed capacity to power a similar city based on conventional design
8718986 masdar city will deploy an integrated transportation system that utilises a revolutionary personal rapid transit system which together with pedestrian and public transit methods will safely move people goods and emergency services in a multi level barrier free environment
8718987 we plan to accomplish this through three measures recycling most of the waste composting part of the waste so we can create more fuel and thirdly to create energy from the waste that cannot be recycled also organic waste and sludge will be used to generate bio gas
8718988 we hope that masdar city will prove that sustainable living can be affordable and attractive in all aspects of human living from businesses and manufacturing facilities to universities and private homes
8718989 masdar city will seek to attract and encourage collaboration between experts in sustainable transportation waste management water and wastewater conservation green construction buildings and industrial materials recycling biodiversity climate change renewable energy and green financial institutions
8718990 we are telling companies involved in these fields come build with us partner with us stay with us and develop solutions together to address global energy and sustainability issues
8718991 we did have a look at other rating systems for buildings such as leed etc
8718992 for example if the present consumption rate of abu dhabi or the us is applied to the world population then we would need seven planets masdar city aims to be less than one planet which is the general principle it is founded on
8718993 our long term social goal is to create a society that consumes less not by forcibly changing the behaviour of people but by giving them the technological tools and making them aware of their behaviour
8718994 i just had to wait until the electrodes in my brain were back to normal im good for a couple more years now it happened 2 years ago so maybe this is just an every couple years thing
8718995 dad we can talk about whether you have electrodes in your brain another time but first your friends need keys were over an hour away it sounded like you were having a stroke
8718996 we didnt have freddys number we all should have each others numbers
8718997 i need to know what the site plan is going to be
8718998 without a site plan without the residents knowing whats going to happen is frightening
8718999 please dont rezone this until you have actual plans and you know what you want to put there so we can all have a voice
8719000 no one has more dust than us we live with that
8719001 why are you putting whatever garbage referring to public facilities you have in the northwest
8719002 you need to understand the land is being set aside for future needs while we dont have to pay money for it

8719004 winning booble girl of the year would be a great honor but i wanted to do something special with the cash prize
8719005 b a b e is a wonderful organization and i cant think of a better group to donate the money after all we all love breasts and if i am named booble girl of the year then i want the money to go to a group dedicated to protecting breasts and womens health issues
8719006 its kind of an amazing thing because youve got a 43 year old self made internet starlet so to speak going up against someone who is arguably the biggest porn star in the world
8719007 theyve been going back and forth in a very dramatic contest where they both have mobilized tremendously large fan bases and it has led to an unprecedented number of votes which of course is very gratifying for us
8719008 i dont know whos going to win but i know both contestants well and think that either one would be a fantastic girl of the year for us and i am very gratified to hear that tera would give her money to charity weve worked with that charity before and were big fans
8719009 needless to say breast preservation is a key interest of ours

8719011 after two weeks of testing and developing new affiliate tools for the site we are proud to officially release sdboy com our newest zbuckz joint venture
8719012 this is the first time that san diego boys photos and videos have been made available on the web which makes the site truly fresh and exclusive for consumers
8719013 customers and fans of my video line have been asking when an exclusive site would be available and i am thrilled we can now give it them the site offers the highest quality videos and exclusives as well as never seen before production photos of all our models and videos
8719014 there are so many different skill sets that are involved with creating adult online websites that unless the studio is truly experienced in web design and marketing or have a lot of time and money to invest id advise them to team up with an experienced marketing partner
8719015 it is often difficult for dvd producers to market themselves to their full potential online you need designers programmers marketing people and editors to run a successful adult web company and it is a huge investment
8719016 likewise filming content is also a very specialized job that takes a great amount of time hard work and investment by using an experienced adult affiliate program studios can save themselves tons of time and money in establishing themselves online its really a win win situation and i think we are going to be seeing a lot more of these types of partnerships being formed in the industry
8719017 an example of how i do this is by using unique titles or text as well as eye catching samples we have had much success with boykakke the first gay asian site devoted to the bukakke niche and i believe much of that can be attributed to the catchy title
8719018 i try to add a personal touch with the latest site sdboy com all the writing comes from the perspective of the director producer who speaks to the customers directly as if they are his best friends joining him on the filming shoot
8719019 i think it is very important to connect with the audience you are trying to reach finally i work with my team of designers to create top notch affiliate tools for our webmasters we are lucky to have hundreds of great webmasters that send us traffic and my goal is to do all i can to work closely with them and give them the best tools and support to sell our sites

8719028 i think thats taking some of the steam out of this rally

8719031 it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream
8719032 if he were here he would say its not an accident
8719033 the reason why dr king says i have a dream is because we didnt have anything else we didnt have any money we didnt have any political power per se we didnt have a great mass of educated persons but we had dreams and im of the impression that we still need dreams
8719034 barack has come a long ways in terms of carrying the baton he represents a new wave of the dream in which we are very proud extremely proud remember its still a dream because reality has to be the substance of the dream the stuff that makes the dream real
8719035 there is a moment in which things have to happen there is a window of opportunity there is a moment in which lets say the plane can rise he has seized that moment there are forces that have been at work that have brought him to where he is i dont know if hell ever be president or not that remains to be seen i do know he wouldnt be where he is if certain forces had not been at work to bring him to where he is
8719036 to see this come to bear in the rose that has blossomed in barack obama certainly does not answer all of our questions but this is a major milestone

8719043 sadly we frequently see patients admitted to a hospital with a devastating stroke who are known to have atrial fibrillation yet were either not taking warfarin or were taking a dose that is not therapeutic we consider these to be potentially preventable strokes
8719044 on one hand we have an extremely effective and cheap medication for stroke prevention warfarin yet on the other hand it remains under used in people who would benefit most from it
8719045 this is a public health priority because atrial fibrillation is one of the most common causes of stroke
8719046 many more strokes could be prevented if anti coagulation therapy were optimized in the population at large
8719047 this is mainly because its a hassle however this study confirms that many strokes can be avoided if patients are adequately anti coagulated therefore both patients and doctors need to do a better job of overcoming the inconvenience of warfarin
8719048 warfarin is usually the best and safest available treatment to prevent stroke in people with atrial fibrillation increasing the uptake of warfarin would reduce the risk of death and disability of stroke

8719064 i dont underestimate peter he is a good puncher i will give my best to be the winner to take my title back and to make history where two brothers will be champions at the same time its a huge motivation for me
8719065 vitali you never beat a champion you say you are the champion but you are not a champion you cant be the champion until you beat me and you cant
8719066 i am making one promise today i will knock vitali out trust me i will knock out vitali and then i will beat his brother there is no doubt about that
8719067 we are immensely proud of what they have achieved and inspired by their performance
8719068 i think his proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer

8719073 i would like very much that it the government and the coalition continue its operation but the coalition is kept together by the sole thing the unity of priorities it is destroyed by subjective priorities and is consolidated by national interests i regret that national interests are of minor importance for a certain part of the coalition
8719074 by the verdict today they have given voice to the victims

8719111 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8719112 im very happy for adam hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8719113 being human it changed him a lot it was a very difficult process to go through

8719121 i am happy that aids related deaths have decreased by over 75 over the last four years in comparison with aids related deaths we had in 2003 to 2004 because of increased free treatment
8719122 this represents a 67 survival rate but we still need to do more because those who did not make it may have died because they started the treatment late or did not have access to proper nutrition
8719123 primary health care which integrates health in all of governments policies is the best framework for doing so
8719124 central to the commissions recommendations is creating the conditions for people to be empowered to have freedom to lead flourishing lives
8719125 following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
8719126 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8719127 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8719128 after 3 years of gathering evidence the commission on social determinants of health has performed an invaluable service in making the health case for a fairer society it is a case that deserves the full support of health professionals and policymakers in all countries at last equity is taking its rightful place at the centre of public debate about health the commissions report is a fitting tribute to dr j w lee whos late director general who initially commissioned this brave project

8719151 the commissioner has come around and hes embraced it because the technology is undeniable im sure there was a time when all of us watched baseball on black and white tvs now i bet you everybody in the room has a high def tv
8719152 the commissioner has been very clear were not going any farther than weve gone
8719153 i started walking today i brushed my own teeth today sat up in a chair today fed myself today
8719154 i just had to come down here because its a great moment for our country for our people
8719155 did you in 1963 think you would see a day like this
8719156 our heavenly father has watched over us all of these years and the people are really coming together and living martin luther kings dream
8719157 he definitely does not want to get locked into some category as a black candidate because thats almost a sure death knell for his campaign
8719158 there are a lot of people black and white who hope that hes the guy to heal all racial wounds and take us away from those unending racial tensions in the country someone who doesnt focus exclusively on race
8719159 i think there are lots of white people who say i feel good about supporting this black guy
8719160 to be sure barack obama was attempting to run a campaign that was marked by color blindness and color muteness
8719161 you know im not going to run as a black candidate im not going to talk about my blackness
8719162 from that moment forward barack obama has certainly been seen as a black candidate
8719163 but as the jeremiah wright thing died down its gone from the front of our conversation to the back
8719164 why does the guy never say anything anything about the most important racial issues civil rights issues in the country like school vouchers
8719165 he never says anything so people then think well maybe hes some secret militant and crazy thats what they think about his wife or about reverend wright
8719166 to some extent barack obamas failure to speak more often about race makes people worry
8719167 since he never talks about race they dont know where he stands so their minds start to turn against him
8719168 i think this is the worst movie ive ever seen or maybe thats what makes it great
8719169 the courts and judge perry are under an obligation to maintain open public proceedings
8719170 i asked that those matters be placed on the record they were not for whatever reason it would seem apparent that matters relating to touching on the credibility of a witness in a very serious murder case are essentially secret
8719171 im a little perplexed as to why mr lamberts saying any of it
8719172 i dont know what else i can say other than the judge has spoken
8719173 the child was in the temporary voluntary custody of an aunt and a live in boyfriend
8719174 the injuries were severe enormous amount of bruising on the body i believe they realized the childs best interest was that the child would be transported to kosair childrens hospital

8719178 everyone wanted me to take the oath so it is now done and i look forword to my role with my colleagues in parti keadilan rakyat pas and dap in parliament i am glad to be back after a decade
8719179 however there is no need to talk about it now we will inform about bn mps crossing over when the time is right
8719180 he won because he appeased our national need for degradation thus this degradation is essential and politically relevant therefore we are justified in continuing to provide it
8719181 i do understand his policies and how they work and i do feel that he understands my situation and how to improve it but i am not voting for him because he drinks wine instead of beer
8719182 the people are becoming more and more politically informed thanks to the alternative media
8719183 in malaysian politics you have the both the bn and opposition parties controlling 30 of the hardcore base vote and the 40 in the middle will determine victory and in permatang pauh he anwar solidly captured 70
8719184 there were two things that turned off voters in the recent by elections one was the sodomy allegations and the other was the playing up of racial sentiments the twin attacks on anwar did not hold water they actually backfired
8719185 with regards to why anwar gained chinese support despite a bn candidate fluent in chinese the chinese saw the message over the candidate bn tried to play a divide and rule game by portraying datuk arif shah omar shah as a pro chinese candidate on one hand while attacking anwar as a malay traitor
8719186 so no matter how proficient arif shah was at hokkien or mandarin it would not have helped
8719187 anwar has been consistent in his message for change to free the country from racial politics and corruption and that message has gone down well across communities the key factor was that people were frustrated with the status quo with bn politics and just wanted a change
8719188 no one believes in bn like they did before and there is a lack of trust in bn leaders umno has remained in a state of denial since march 8
8719189 the people are becoming more and more politically informed thanks to the alternative media they are insulting the intellectual voters by trying to use the media to play up their stories the bn governments thinking gap is far from the peoples their campaign strategy is a failure it is too out dated and it is just not working
8719190 the people want something but the bn gives a different thing those who believed that the bn government would do something to change their lives are probably upset
8719191 the ruling party could not answer or respond to all the questions put forth by opposition leaders anwars promise of a new hope for malaysia has somehow convinced many even some strong bn supporters
8719192 bn has also lost the confidence of the malays and non malays especially among the middle class group it failed to understand the peoples grievances and that is how they become silent voters
8719193 i am not denying that the bn government has contributed a lot in the past but the present leadership has failed to address the rakyats grievances
8719194 it needs to rebuild the confidence of the people in bn and its image stop all personal attacks on the opposition and show more transparency

8719200 boring doesnt work for me make your pitch fun and exciting
8719201 it is possible to get coverage of lesser known actors and movies
8719202 i got a handwritten envelope and invitation to a play and because the publicist had such a passion for the client i decided to cover the play and that relationship grew later the play became a move and oscar contender my big fat greek wedding was an academy award nominated 2002 romantic comedy film
8719203 if your story has a connection to hollywood it is a fun and interesting story it will be easy to sell tease and promote
8719204 we do a little more edgy story for the insider and we have stories with a different hook
8719205 i only have 40 seconds and i work with recognizable names in movies or a list celebrities
8719206 because of who i work for i have no local interest
8719207 the associated press is worldwide my pieces are heard with my voice wrapped around the interviews ive done or i will use individual sound bites all of that goes to toronto syracuse vancouver and every where so a little local interest doesnt work what my audience wants is a recognizable name recognizable celebrities or a tie into a recognizable movie tv show stage plays or something like that were they dont have to scratch their heads in the 30 seconds in the time telling the story
8719208 i only have 40 seconds and i work with recognizable names in movies or a list celebrities
8719209 there are two audiences we are serving the audience in the car and the audience of the stations we are serving
8719210 less is more and the phones work well with us we dont have to get all our interviews in person
8719211 i actually prefer doing a phone interview and remember 90 seconds moves like a freight train but since it is syndicated your story is moving nationally ross loves exclusives and prefers email pitches at
8719212 the one that his handed to you and the one you get from digging for three months exclusives include websites getting the story first by a 15 minutes or a day it is very very important to have good relationships with reporters
8719213 you need to have a fun story because boring doesnt work for us the question producers ask is how do i tease that if they dont know how to promote the story then they producers will have less interest in it if i get a good tease and pitch for a story then often i will get the green light
8719214 if the publicist could be just one step ahead then i can tell them i only get a minute and half for this story and maybe i can interview them later just to be put on the spot is a little tough especially if you do not know who that person is and that happens on a regular basis
8719215 rod roddy says come on down and get your colonoscopy
8719216 it got my attention and we probably would have aired the story if we had the tv show the price is right on our station
8719217 i can take nuggets i dont need a whole lot of video or audio because my national syndicated program is only 90 seconds however sometime i will take a local story and offer it to the news desk at kfwb
8719218 there are two audiences we are serving the audience in the car and the audience of the stations we are serving
8719219 however there are some stories that the audience wants to know but the station program directors are not too thrilled with it
8719220 ap gets a lot of exclusives due to the enormity of its distribution
8719221 we like to get exclusives it is part of the challenge and fun of the business
8719222 most of my stories are a day of local charity and it makes no sense to exclude a station at a charitable event and if we are told we are not allowed to cover a charity because it is an exclusive event for another station we will report that we are not allowed entering the event if exclusive for et at least let us have the story for the 11 p m news i dont want to get a story that aired two days ago on channel 5 ktla
8719223 my news director at a radio station had a big picture of a crowded freeway posted on the outside of his office door that read how many of these people are watching tv or reading the newspaper

8719232 at aptv you have to pitch stories that are important to the entire world
8719233 because of that we need to focus on artists or actors who already have somewhat of a reputation it can be any entertainment event or awards show but it has to have significant artist
8719234 so when we publish your story half the planet will hear or see it
8719235 isaza reminds pr pros to keep in mind essentials of lighting noise and deadlines for tv shooting minimum of two weeks
8719236 we are a major metropolitan newspaper in the second market of the country and it happens to be published in spanish
8719237 since we are the second largest paper in this market we are understaffed
8719238 we cover music tv and film and we look at different genres and like most entertainment publications we are celebrity driven
8719239 the spanish language is a major driving factor especially television in the stories we do to a lesser degree we cover latinos who are doing things in the english language
8719240 urban network is a magazine that primarily started out for the industry entertainment itself
8719241 it is only recently that the magazine has grown into a consumer oriented publication so right now we are broadening our scope of things that we cover we tried to target a balance of things that are both popular and stories that need to be brought to the attention of our readers on a wider basis so we use major stories to bring people into the magazine so they can learn about lesser known topic that we want them to know about
8719242 we give priority to artists our users are searching for we get an update every wednesday on the music side and on the regular search engine yahoo side we get daily statistics of who are the most searched music artists
8719243 we feature about 10 artists per month in our various taped programs and we need at least one month notice we also feel that we have an obligation to cover new artists
8719244 since our audience is urban black were looking for events issues that matter to our audience in particular our audience is 25 to 45 and 60 percent women
8719245 a basic approach is pitches and stories that relate to women and our specific target audience
8719246 at connection iii entertainment corp our flagship program made in hollywood which airs on abc cbs fox upn and cw networks and kcal tv ch
8719247 i too prefer email pitches and a two weeks notice since we have multicultural ownership we are always sensitive to multicultural projects so we cover the general market but also african american and multicultural markets too

8719272 es importante comenzar bien la pasada temporada hicimos un solo punto en los tres primeros partidos y este a o debemos mejorar este inicio es muy importante
8719273 no debemos tener miedo a ning n equipo y lo importante es tener confianza en nosotros mismos
8719274 el celtic tiene un f tbol muy f sico y ser tan dif cil como el manchester
8719275 para ganar la liga de campeones hay que ganar a los mejores tener un grupo complicado es mejor para empezar fuerte y arrancar mejor la competici n
8719276 sobre el papel otros equipos espa oles lo tienen m s f cil
8719277 no hay que asustarse sino competir porque somos el equipo que m s veces ha ganado esta competici n tenemos mucha ilusi n por volver a ganarla pero con tranquilidad paso a paso

8719352 the reality is that international relations are changing for the first time since 1991 russia has used military force against a sovereign state in the post soviet area the world will not be the same a new phenomenon is unfolding in front or our eyes a re emerging power that is willing to use force to guarantee its interests the west does not know how to respond

8719355 russias powerful oligarchs have hundreds of billions of dollars in western bank accounts they would stand to lose a great deal in the event of a cold war style standoff that could conceivably result at some stage in the wests freezing of such holdings the u s government should talk to the central asian states as well russias pummeling of georgia must have set off alarm bells in their capitals
8719356 russias military response had another purpose as well to show that the medvedev putin tandem can be tough this show of strength was particularly important because the elite had started to fragment and the public was starting to wonder who was really in control of the country

8719358 theres one other way the u s could hit russia where it hurts by strengthening the dollar the greenbacks weakness has contributed greatly to the record oil prices that have in turn made russia flush with petrodollars and fueled mr putins expansionist ambitions crude prices continued to fall yesterday 12 august below 115 a barrel and further deflating that bubble would do more to sober up an oil drunk kremlin than would any kind of economic sanctions

8719361 a core western assumption since 1991 that moscow would never again invade its neighbors has been shattered nato also needs to reassure those partners likely to be the next targets of russian pressure and possible aggression first and foremost ukraine this means rethinking natos enlargement strategy in the mid 1990s nato adopted an enlargement strategy based on integration and not as a strategic response to russia we consciously raised the bar and requirements for new members our focus was less on protection than on democratic reforms to help anchor these countries to the west but we also consciously left ourselves the option of lowering the bar in the future if the security environment took a turn for the worse it now has done just that and we need to shift our criteria again last but not least we should freeze the nato russia dialogue in brussels for the foreseeable future if we are honest this relationship has never become what we wanted a channel for consultation and real cooperation moscow has walked away from many of its commitments in the founding act it treats the nato russia council as yet another platform for its anti western strategy russian nato ambassador dimitry rogozin behaves like an old style propagandist seeking to sow dissension in the ranks of allies we have lots of channels to talk to moscow lets shut this one down until moscow gets serious about doing business and not spreading anti nato propaganda
8719362 how would we have reacted if moscow had brought western europe into the warsaw pact established bases in mexico and panama put missile defense radars and rockets in cuba and joined with china to build pipelines to transfer mexican and venezuelan oil to pacific ports for shipment to asia and cut us out if there were russian and chinese advisers training latin american armies the way we are in the former soviet republics how would we react would we look with bemusement on such russian behavior
8719363 the russians have now proven two things first contrary to the reality of the 1990s they can execute a competent military operation second contrary to regional perception the united states cannot intervene we would expect the russians to get traction but if they dont the russians are aware that they are in the long run much weaker than the americans and that they will retain their regional position of strength only while the united states is off balance in iraq if the lesson isnt absorbed the russians are capable of more direct action and they will not let this chance slip away this is their chance to redefine their sphere of influence they will not get another
8719364 theres a strong element of paradox the one thing that could re create the west is russia acting in opposition to the west nato had lost its way the russians have created a situation which gives nato a raison detre again to contain russia

8719576 the young boys are obviously traumatized the 10 year old was crying very upset all he really wanted was his batman comic books but really both of the boys knew exactly what was going on
8719577 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
8719578 we can meet these challenges with barack obama yes we can and finally yes we will
8719579 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do
8719580 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8719581 i get their point of view from schools people coming in and shooting them and stuff but why dont you just lock your doors where nobody can come in
8719582 youre thirty miles away from any town no matter what but you know and youre protecting your kids plus other peoples kids that are coming to school its a good thing in a way
8719583 we know which employees have the permits thats still not a fool proof 100 percent guarantee that were going to recognize them right away but you know thats something we need to address with the school and the school needs to address with us
8719584 i did say that ive made the selection and thats all youre gonna get
8719585 a reporter asked him how many houses do you have
8719586 i think ah ill have my staff get to you mostly condominiums ill have to get back to you
8719587 if your president doesnt hear whats going in your life and doesnt see whats happening in your life then that president isnt going to be fighting for you
8719588 well its seven seven houses and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
8719589 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year and bought his 1 million mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
8719590 we know we need every democrat to rally behind senator obamas candidacy
8719591 well i am doing everything i can to campaign for senator obama
8719592 we just went to the car and he told me he had to handcuff me i was a little surprised and told them i didnt think that was necessary he said that was procedure cuffed me grabbed my head and put me in the car
8719593 under those circumstances the warrant says we shall arrest so thats why it got to the point it did

8719596 its a summons to pay 13 75 for tolls in hilton head that i had no idea we were down in hilton head apparently theyve got the wrong vehicle
8719597 it doesnt appear that this has been checked by anybody as you can see the vehicle is not a sedan its an suv and they apparently randomly saw the 77 and didnt look at anything else and just decided that my car was the one that should pay the fine
8719598 theres no reason to run a toll booth for a dollar and 25 cents which really doesnt make sense ide like to see the individual reprimanded especially being in the state legislature these are people that we rely on to make the laws and make changes and so forth and if weve got people running toll booths that are in the legislature it doesnt make sense
8719599 mccain said in an early morning radio interview that he was bringing along to that event both former pennsylvania gov tom ridge and former massachusetts gov mitt romney two of the leading names on his short list but he cautioned against assuming that meant either one would be the pick
8719600 say he has told his inner circle of his pick but wont call the decision official until he has discussed it with his wife cindy who has been in the country of georgia
8719601 o ne campaign operative familiar with the working of a presidential level campaign cautioned that a sweep of such a location could have been conducted in advance of romney appearing as a surrogate not the vice presidential nominee at an upcoming mccain campaign stop in michigan
8719602 look im not going to get into who i call and dont call
8719603 republican strategist karl rove called sen joseph i lieberman i conn late last week and urged him to contact sen john mccain r ariz to withdraw his name from vice presidential consideration according to three sources familiar with the conversation
8719604 wouldnt answer questions about whether he had been asked to provide financial and personal information from screening
8719605 asked by ktis host dave clutter whether he had any announcements pawlenty said he was going to be vice president of his fantasy football league
8719606 a senior team in his administration that reflects his values
8719607 about 32 percent of respondents said theyd favor mccain if he picked romney thats double the number of those who said theyd be less inclined to back the ticket
8719608 connecticut sen joe lieberman looks toxic to the ticket nearly twice as many people said theyd be less likely to vote for mccain if the former democrat were on the ticket many democrats see the former vice presidential candidate of 2000 as a turncoat conservative republicans cant stand his abortion rights record
8719609 he said he saw the criticism as the politics of jealousy or envy or a sense that somehow were going to be less likely to vote for someone because theyve achieved economic success
8719610 gov bobby jindal declared a pre storm state of emergency this afternoon announcing the mobilization of 3 000 national guard with as many 5 000 call ups possible depending on the course of hurricane gustav
8719611 jindal also has asked for a federal state of emergency a request that has not yet been answered
8719612 carly fiorina economic adviser to presidential candidate john mccain yesterday told pennsylvania reporters the senator can win the state despite its economically hurting residents
8719613 i know as john mccain knows the people of pennsylvania are hurting right now ms
8719614 but then i weighed out the options if something wasnt wrong then no real harm was done if something was wrong i really had no option so obviously i had to tell her
8719615 id seen a news article here in the u k a few years ago something similar and it just sparked a memory of that also the word cancer sprang to mind with the same memory so obviously i was quite concerned and just decided to do more research
8719616 l cannot even begin to describe how we feel toward maddie
8719617 do i consider madeleine our hero most certainly if she hadnt sent that e mail rowans prognosis wouldnt be as good as it is
8719618 i suppose if thats how they feel then thats what i am to them
8719619 i think anybody in my situation would have done the same thing if they had known what i knew and had the opportunity to say it
8719620 i suppose im a hero in a certain sense but in another sense i think im rather normal and i care about people
8719621 it usually happens in infancy or early childhood and doctors precisely look in a babys eye with that light looking for a certain kind of reflection when that reflection is abnormal it raises the risk of whether this type of tumor is there
8719622 that white reflection you see in the babys eye is sometimes picked up just on routine photography in this case a web picture but what you hope is that doctors will see it internally before it gets to this stage
8719623 sometimes its there but its so faint it really appears later its hard to put blame somehow it was missed with our increasing number of premature babies there are other problems that could also sort of look like it
8719624 so it is a reminder for parents to ask doctors when you go for the baby checkup is everything ok
8719625 if something looks like this in a picture or your babys eyes arent moving together or one eye is bigger than another just pick up the phone and say somethings not right
8719626 in a case like this you have to go to your local medical center and see a pediatrician who specializes in just this kind of problem
8719627 this is not the kind of treatment that is done in a local hospital this is where you search out the specialist
8719628 we just went to the car and he told me he had to handcuff me i was a little surprised and told them i didnt think that was necessary he said that was procedure cuffed me grabbed my head and put me in the car
8719629 under those circumstances the warrant says we shall arrest so thats why it got to the point it did
8719630 yeah i 100 percent admit it was my fault i should have paid it
8719631 i cant really blame the cops they were doing what they had to do
8719632 they said hey youre from hays and heres what your coach did
8719633 the university has dismissed bill shanahan as an assistant professor in our communications program and as head coach of our debate program for violation of the universitys faculty code of ethics
8719634 its just a known fact that policy debate is evolving
8719635 and if i did it was to specifically debate under bill shanahan

8719647 they should be employing him to find the holes in their security system not prosecuting him he has aspergers syndrome which should be taken into consideration as its a high functioning type of autism which would make him very obsessive i think he should get 1 year in a uk jail that would be sufficient

8719661 tom clearly is one of the best writers and teachers of writing in the world today
8719662 he wrote a seminal piece of journalism called a cry in the night that dominated our craft for a long time and made a model for the rest of us to follow
8719663 hes been my teacher since the day i met him iu will soon get a glimpse of his passion and ferocious belief that journalism should be fair and truthful but also raucous subversive emotional and daring
8719664 was in the small group of writers who led the renaissance in newspaper narratives in the 80s and 90s and he is known around the world for his evangelism on the subject which is why iu came calling
8719665 tom has so many strengths one is that he knows how to do journalism he has a body of work that students can study and learn from which i think is the best way for a student to learn second he knows how to explain journalism ive heard him teach many times and every time ive walked away excited by the possibilities of what we do
8719666 in his teaching french is skilled at striking a balance between using his stories and not making all his teaching about war stories
8719667 windows memory diagnostic supports x86 based computers with the following microprocessors intel pentium or celeron families amd k6 athlon or duron families and microprocessors compatible with those listed above you can test all types of ram that run on x86 based computers with the supported microprocessors
8719668 however if you have error checking and correcting ecc ram windows memory diagnostic may not report any errors because the ecc mechanism automatically detects and corrects the error it might still be useful to run windows memory diagnostic if you have ecc ram because it may detect errors that the ecc ram is unable to correct which indicates problems with the ram windows memory diagnostic is limited to testing only the first 4 gigabytes gb of ram if you have more than 4 gb of ram the remaining ram after the first 4 gb will not be tested by windows memory diagnostic
8719669 we have criteria that we apply at the end of our milestones and before we go to beta and we wont ship without broadly meeting these criteria
8719670 sometimes these criteria are micro benchmarks page faults processor utilization working set gamer frame rates and other times they are more scenario based and measure time to complete a task clock time mouse clicks we do these measurements on a variety of hardware platforms 32 bit or 64 bit 1 2 4gb of ram 5400 to 7200 rpm or solid state disks a variety of processors etc because of the inherent tradeoffs in some architectural approaches we often introduce conditional code that depends on the type of hardware on which windows is running
8719671 performance is made up of many different elements we could be talking about response time to a specific request it might mean how much ram is typical or what cpu customers need we could be talking about the clock time to launch a program it could mean boot or standby resume it could mean watching cpu activity or disk i o activity or lack disk activity it could mean battery life it might even mean something as mundane as typical disk footprint after installation all of these are measures of performance all of these are systematically tracked during the course of development

8719702 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8719703 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8719704 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8719705 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done
8719706 the presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8719707 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8719708 serious signal for those who are trying to justify the aggression
8719709 its like jennifer is on nothing less than a revenge tour while in the past jennifer shunned publicity and shrank from photographers lenses now shes openly encouraging the attention smiling showing off her body and creating photo ops
8719710 since john said it was he who broke off their four month romance jennifer has kept a stiff upper lip and let her actions do the talking making sure everyone sees her smiling and looking sexy
8719711 jennifer was glowing smiling and being very friendly as she ate tuna tartare rock shrimp and spinach salad with a glass of wine it was hard to believe this was a woman who just broke up with her boyfriend
8719712 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8719713 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8719714 155 high rises of 15 stories or more being constructed
8719715 you can install the best security systems in the world but if your staff does not respect the information they are entrusted with then the information will most definitely go astray just as the findings of this survey have illustrated
8719716 thats why we recommend companies secure their privileged identities and sensitive information in a digital vault only giving individuals access to the information they actually need when they need it while also keeping a log of who has accessed what and when

8719750 as an arab american woman i am of course aware that the title of my book is an ethnic slur indeed i selected the title to highlight one of the novels major themes racism in the tradition of dick gregorys autobiography nigger the jewish magazine heeb or the feminist magazine bitch the title is rude and shocking but it is not gratuitous besides the fact that the main character must endure taunting about her ethnicity including being called a towelhead so much of the novels plot is fueled by the characters attitudes toward race

8719758 but i did my first draft of it just before the strike last year and i think its one of my favorite things ive ever written
8719759 rather than it being something thats a terrible thing to happen its actually making your character into the most bad ass sort of action hero spy possible

8719764 i dont see any reason why they cant pull this plan back a little bit just to really respect the flood plain and to really let nature take its course
8719765 its something thats being given to the county and im really happy to see that youre facing the river instead of facing away
8719766 weve had so many of the areas along the rivanna river thrown away and its been the back door in this youre actually setting the stage here maybe for people who come after to actually use this river and this walkway so i appreciate that aspect

8719770 when the democrats took control of congress in 2007 and oil was 50 a barrel and corn 2 a bushel house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid promised an energy plan were still waiting for it today crude oil is 134 and corn is 6 50 its pretty clear whos to blame congress in fact house and senate democrats have obstructed any progress in america s fight to regain some semblance of energy independence
8719771 i searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and to join me in making washington work for the american people
8719772 you cant change america when you supported george bush 95 of the time
8719773 the biden choice feels like a very safe choice to me theyre putting somebody on the ticket with a great deal of experience especially in foreign policy someone who has a real record of legislative achievement which some people complain obama doesnt have
8719774 in recent election cycles vice presidential candidates havent meant very much in terms of who won and who lost
8719775 youre going to have all the resources this campaign has available thats the good news
8719776 the bad news youre going to have a whole helluva lot of me because im coming home
8719777 joe bidens effort to create a record out of thin air for barack obama will not be enough to make up for barack obamas lack of experience lack of judgment and plans to raise taxes on the hard working families of pennsylvania
8719778 i was a 29 year old kid running for the united states senate in 1972 there was somewhere between six and 10 busloads of people from scranton who just spontaneously got on a bus and came down literally there were hundreds of thousands of people
8719779 barack obama couldve made that speech were he alive in 1972
8719780 by the way if i hear one more time that he was 11 years old when i went to the senate im going to smack somebody
8719781 we were ensured that the fire alarms and water were going to be hooked up for these children on the first day of school kids are walking out of the building and its raining theyre going into a classroom where there is no fire alarms no running water for these kids
8719782 when you have no fire alarms and no p a the teacher has walkie talkies it could be too late its not a safe issue
8719783 were satisfied with what theyve done ive been in touch with the state fire marshalls office and exactly what theyre doing is what he suggested also so we feel the children are safe
8719784 it was supposed to have been taken care of by now i have children in this school and i dont want them to be unsafe and i woudnt put my child in a school thats unsafe
8719785 if i had known that this stuff was not in place especially the fire alarms i would not had sent my kids to school until everything was in place
8719786 in order to paint both her professional life and her husbands and in order to communicate what she feels is his singular compassion she had to paint an america that is darker sadder grimmer than most americans experience their country to be and this of course is an incomplete picture an incorrectly weighted picture sadness and struggle are part of life but so are guts and verve and achievement and success and hardiness and triumph
8719787 as a usenet discussion grows longer the probability of a comparison involving nazis or hitler approaches one
8719788 how in the world is mccain going to get that many people to show up
8719789 it has too many variables to guarantee a good tv picture the set the athenian columns looks hokey
8719790 it has every possibility of looking like a nuremberg rally
8719791 hopefully obama will start sending the republican war criminals to nuremburg
8719792 our cars can travel pretty fast but he was definitely exceeding what our speeds are
8719793 theyre lucky that they were all conscious and were able to get out in time before the vehicle was fully engulfed in flames
8719794 i dont know whether he was trying to act out a scene in a video game or what he was trying to do but he said it always worked for him in video games
8719795 we have not found anything hazardous in the initial testing and the initial examination that we did
8719796 the letter certainly had some threatening language so they had reason to fear but we did not find the initial report was white power they did not find large quantities
8719797 in any situation like this when its a little out of the norm unusual something that could create a hazard we really want to jump on it right away and make sure were protecting the folks coming into see us but the patients and health care workers that we currently have in the hospital
8719798 our clients were picked up by one of the largest casino operations in the world for a free flight and weekend of fun but instead they encountered an entirely avoidable commercial bus crash which we believe is due to the defendants transport of passengers in a poorly maintained and manufactured vehicle since august 1 2008 we have seen four commercial bus crashes nationwide two of which were fatal something has to change
8719799 bus and motor coach safety is mandated by federal regulation however the individual carrier has additional responsibilities to take all necessary measures to provide for the safe travel of its passengers in the instance of this crash harrahs failed on both counts the responsible parties violated several federally mandated regulations and made no effort to provide any additional safety precautions we believe these particular failures led to the injury and death of innocent individuals
8719800 he suddenly notices the silhouette of a person standing inside of his apartment pointing what he described as an object at him
8719801 he then notices a laser beam on his torso and he runs out
8719802 the dog was making too much noise so she bound the dog with the duct tape she brought along to bound her ex boyfriend
8719803 its pretty bizarre we havent seen anything like this in the past
8719804 you lived with him slept in the same room and everything its just like being a member of the family and its losing a member of the family
8719805 it was in his possessions at the time he was killed and that came back to woody alberts brother and from what i understand woody just didnt want to open up the package i mean it was an emotional situation with him and he just stored it away some place
8719806 well i was flabbergasted i guess thats the way to explain it because i had no idea that it ever existed
8719807 as you probably know i have been in combat i was one of the first to jump in
8719808 the fact that he gave his life for his country overwhelms everything else its more important to everybody than anything else he did
8719809 we look for everything we start from the front to the rear any thing loose leaks we have checks on top of checks even though there are federal standards we have state standards as well and they sometimes supercede the federal standards in a lot of areas
8719810 try and keep our children safe you really have to pray for your children and pray they listen to the bus drivers who you hope are trained to deal with those situations

8719832 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionaires
8719833 the cost of making a game is so high that you need to recover it by selling a lot more units
8719834 you cant give up half the market by selling exclusives
8719835 its a trend were excited about but not completely surprised about if you look at the installed base and attached rate of customers to the xbox
8719836 third party publishers are looking at the same things we are and they want to put games into as many peoples hands as possible
8719837 the lack of a dominant console means its too difficult for software makers to give up on a console
8719838 with the ps3 or xbox 360 you dont have a clear winner like the playstation 2 or playstation were
8719839 the reality of exclusives is that they will become far more infrequent the way hardware companies have to offset that is through enhancing the quality of games coming through their own studios that will drive customers to buy their own hardware system
8719840 people were buying the xbox in anticipation of halo 3

8719843 who would have thought that four decades later we would still be fighting
8719844 one is a very serious bid and that has been accompanied by interest in the same player by two other football clubs something might happen
8719845 we are trying to improve and the players know we are trying to improve their situation
8719846 we are working quite hard behind the scenes to get players in but you can only do your own bit as highlighted by the man united tottenham berbatov scenario
8719847 you can only do as much as you can then you need someone to say yes
8719848 we have got bids on the table for a number of players and if players become available at the other end hopefully they will become hull city players eventually
8719849 it is a chance for me to get some games and i think that is something i definitely have to do at this stage of my career
8719850 with the new players who have come to rangers my chances will probably be a bit more limited and this is the best option for me to pursue just now
8719851 my main aim in the long term is still to play at ibrox
8719852 that hasnt changed and if this is what i need to do to take the next step im happy to do that
8719853 they will be very very pleased that they dont have to travel far
8719854 i think they will be delighted that theyve not got a lot of travelling to do
8719855 villarreal will not bring up any surprises for them aalborg is the team they will have to be careful of and they will come back to bite you if you disrespect them
8719856 against villarreal i know its a very tough game but people will be looking at the aalborg game and be thinking theres six points for you but i can guarantee that will not be the case for any of the teams facing aalborg
8719857 it will not be an easy six points to pick up so they will be very pleased they dont have to travel but it could have been a lot tougher but how can you say that when youre playing against manchester united and villarreal
8719858 well celtic have already beaten them and they were very unlucky in the first game as well when they played down in manchester the first time they met
8719859 it will be like a home game for them and they will have a big support and manchester united are everybodys favourite not just for the group but probably for the tournament again and rightly so
8719860 it was difficult for us but weve got through so it has been a positive day all round
8719861 we kept on knocking on the door they were in the box seat and could afford to get people behind the ball and play the counter attack
8719862 we always had to be mindful of that but in the end we got our rewards
8719863 after an hours play i thought we upped our energy levels and our play was more progressive
8719864 from that point onwards through extra time there was only one team that looked like they were going to nick it
8719865 we had a couple of chances michael johnson could very well have won it before the end of play
8719866 but well take the result it doesnt matter how we go through
8719867 its a bit of a lottery with penalties but were delighted weve overcome this hurdle
8719868 youre always relieved there are no easy games its a cliche but in europe there arent look at the events of last night with liverpool
8719869 it is a big blow to us and we could be without him kranjcar until around christmas or whatever
8719870 the frustrating thing is he didnt even do the injury playing for us he played nearly all the games last season and hes a player you cant replace really but we are going to try
8719871 jermain has picked up a bug and we just hope he will get over it in time
8719872 as for jerome hes never had a back problem before and we dont know why hes got one now maybe its because of a change of beds since he moved here
8719873 there are still a lot of ways we can play
8719874 although 4 4 2 is the way ive chose to go with these two up front there are going to be some games in which we go back to 4 5 1 which was so successful last season
8719875 ive still got a good squad even though it is not big enough especially with the uefa cup coming up

8719948 tom clearly is one of the best writers and teachers of writing in the world today
8719949 he wrote a seminal piece of journalism called a cry in the night that dominated our craft for a long time and made a model for the rest of us to follow
8719950 hes been my teacher since the day i met him iu will soon get a glimpse of his passion and ferocious belief that journalism should be fair and truthful but also raucous subversive emotional and daring
8719951 was in the small group of writers who led the renaissance in newspaper narratives in the 80s and 90s and he is known around the world for his evangelism on the subject which is why iu came calling
8719952 tom has so many strengths one is that he knows how to do journalism he has a body of work that students can study and learn from which i think is the best way for a student to learn second he knows how to explain journalism ive heard him teach many times and every time ive walked away excited by the possibilities of what we do
8719953 in his teaching french is skilled at striking a balance between using his stories and not making all his teaching about war stories

8719955 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
8719956 this suggests that the brain is responsible for the improvement we saw in patients walking ability it seems to be recruiting other regions to take on the job of areas damaged by stroke
8719957 many stroke survivors believe theres nothing to be gained from further rehabilitation but our results suggest that health and functional benefits from walking on a treadmill can occur even decades out from stroke
8719958 we believe exercise gives individuals a way to fight back against stroke disabilities
