6650000 attebi djwrey abale albert aguste 26 faced a sudden death he suffered a massive cardiac arrest just before half time while playing for the reddy jana sangha first grade collage in the south zonal inter college football match underway at the central college grounds
6650001 a large quantity of blood will be pumped to the arteries and veins of the heart while playing in such a stressed condition the heart may not be capable of holding the blood rush leading to cardiac arrest
6650002 the police said the body will be handed over after getting results of tests conducted on other organs they want to ascertain whether the death was precipitated by the effect of drugs if any
6650003 we will complete the formalities by late thursday and issue a no objection certificate to enable the family fly the body to abidjan in ivory coast of west africa a representative of the ivory coast embassy has come from new delhi to assist the brothers in getting the clearance
6650004 i have won at championships but an olympic medal is more difficult because all the competitors are here i was in good condition
6650005 the weather had no influence on me it was better than a sunny and hot day
6650006 ive never been the leader of a team before and i think we just have to just get closer and more like a team thats what im trying to do
6650007 i dont know if they can quite fill the gap of the gals that left last year but definitely should be moving up a little bit that will really determine how good we are
6650008 jon lafler looks really good justin englund looks great all these kids they wouldnt be here if they werent really talented so i can see any one of them stepping up and helping us
6650009 but im really optimistic because all the returners had great track seasons and im kind of excited because when older people leave theres always younger people that step up i think we have a good shot at making nationals its kind of our goal
6650010 it was a flight from singapore to siem reap it was a very rainy day
6650011 when staff did a go around of the aircraft after landing they discovered that one of the left hand tyres wasnt fully deflated but it obviously had some cuts on it and there was mud on the aircraft
6650012 there was not permanent damage to the aircraft and no injury to passengers
6650013 because there was only damage to the left hand wheels it would be incorrect to say that the aircraft totally left the runway there was nothing wrong with the right hand wheels
6650014 left the runway and blew a tyre and scraped the ground
6650015 weve been told that technical difficulties in siem reap have caused the cancellation for a full 24 hours
6650016 die blossen sechs punkte ohne klarstellungen ohne anzeichen f r ihre einhaltung werfen die frage auf warum wir den rat etwas festschreiben lassen sollten an das sich nicht gehalten wird
6650017 words cannot adequately describe the impact of your conduct on the lives of innocent people
6650018 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin
6650019 that was a scene that we witnessed and then they towed the whale behind their national parks and wildlife boat it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat
6650020 that was the best way it could have been done
6650021 any volunteer based groups working in the interests of the wellington city community are eligible for the award and people are more than welcome to nominate their own groups
6650022 walking and cycling are at the heart of any thriving city and the council has set out its vision to improve walking and cycling conditions in three draft policies
6650023 we already have easily the highest levels of walking and even running to work in the country the aim of the new draft walking and cycling policies is to reduce barriers to walking and cycling to work to schools to our suburban centres to public transport and to recreation the draft policies aim to help us towards our goal of making wellington more liveable better connected more sustainable and more competitive
6650024 we want wellingtonians to see walking and cycling as healthy pleasant and inexpensive ways to get around wellington has wonderful open spaces and the council is improving the track network
6650025 the draft track recreation activities policy looks at the citys off road track network how its used and by whom walkers runners mountain bikers and possible access for horse riders and four wheel drivers
6650026 tracks through open space can be lovely commuting routes as well as enjoyable recreation
6650027 one of the options we would seriously consider is that we would possibly
6650028 if we cant have a competitive proposal there doesnt seem to be a lot of value in us going through this process if the best we can do is come up with a proposal that falls short of what the department of defense is looking for

6650033 the rate of adult obesity now exceeds 25 in 28 states
6650034 f as in fat how obesity policies are failing in america 2007
6650035 the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our health care costs our analysis shows that were not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves
6650036 escrts are like the recycling units of the cell they oversee the constant intake break down and replenishing of junctions on the cell surface
6650037 in a cancer cell where escrts are damaged the junctions may not be restored properly this can cause cells to separate and migrate to form secondary tumours in other parts of the body
6650038 previous studies have shown a link between escrts and the loss of junctions in cells of fruit flies so we want to see whether this is also true in humans
6650039 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
6650040 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6650041 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6650042 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6650043 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration
6650044 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
6650045 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6650046 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
6650047 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
6650048 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
6650049 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6650050 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6650051 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
6650052 were trying to get the nerve tissue to integrate with a device to grow into it to form a better connection
6650053 to get long term release we think these multi component systems are the way to go
6650054 we can control the release by combining the materials in different ways and were confident that we can extend the release time further even to 90 days
6650055 reactive oxygen species lead to oxidative stress in the body which can also cause dna damage we were able to gather clear evidence of a short term increase in certain indicators for oxidative stress during the competition and have already published these results however now we were also able to demonstrate that despite this increase no notable and persistent damage was caused to the athletes dna this is a surprising result which initially appears to contradict the data gathered in similar studies
6650056 the comparable studies analysed different biomarkers for predominantly short lived dna damage our study focused primarily on damage to dna that was subsequently evident in daughter cells following cell division and could therefore be of long term detriment to the body however we can sound the all clear in this respect our study clearly shows that in this case extreme competitive sport did not result in any increase in dna damage
6650057 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
6650058 seguro que me piden eso para que yo deje mis problemas fuera y quede dispuesto a aprender y o conocer de algo que me har muy bien a mi vida
6650059 aqu llegan personas que luego de uno o dos meses no pueden sacarse los zapatos porque se sienten inseguros desnudos y o desequilibrados
6650060 if you call us at the wrong time youre going to wait pretty long
6650061 the combination of an economy that is not very strong right now and this federal program has really hit us hard
6650062 thats part of the reason the unemployment rate is moving up a little
6650063 its not just because people are losing their jobs but because more people are looking for them
6650064 everything was just kind of clicking i had a great start silver im psyched
6650065 we got three medals out of six thats pretty damn good
6650066 maam if i get any closer to that fellah in front of me im gonna hafta buy him a drink
6650067 ah say ah say just what seems to be the mattah heah
6650068 im deciding whether to kill you myself or whether to announce over the pa that a racist redneck from kenner is in the house and its open season on racist rednecks
6650069 i think there is no question that the governments responsibility must include protecting fannie and freddie debt
6650070 it is extraordinarily important they today represent 70 percent of the mortgage market in this country and i think that percentage is growing as other lenders are moving away
6650071 do not assume we are saviors from the stars coming to step in between the aspects of your collective that boast about whos king of the mountain
6650072 for once ps3 owners should be grateful for having to wait ages for a game to show up on their platform
6650073 ginza mall is positioned as a stylish and young shopping center while we target at the young generation in beijing
6650074 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6650075 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6650076 so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6650077 and heres one house the american people cant afford to let john mccain move into
6650078 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6650079 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6650080 we hebben de gymnastiekbond gevraagd om het verder te bekijken
6650081 als we ergens onze vraagtekens bij zetten en we zorgen hebben over iets dat in dit geval dus zo is is de richtlijn dat de betreffende overkoepelende organisatie verder onderzoek doet
6650082 de merken verdubbelen hun inventiviteit om de terugkeer naar de schoolbanken aantrekkelijk te maken en proberen de consument aan te zetten het schoolmateriaal flink op voorhand te kopen
6650083 er werden zowel meer huishoudelijke als industri le installaties gebouwd er komen ook heel wat erg grote installaties bij dat maakt de groei moeilijk te voorspellen
6650084 saya adalah bisnis manajer profesional saya punya staf lebih dari selusin saya telah bekerja pada banyak aktor kelas tinggi musisi dan perusahaan multi million dollar kenapa saya harus mencuri dari rihanna
6650085 deshalb sollte der grad der wirtschaftlichen abschw chung im ausland geb hrend beachtet werden
6650086 if the city council comes to us with a piece of legislation we will look at it we will consider it and we will make what i hope is an informed judgment as to what is in the best interest of this city
6650087 the city council has the legal right to change term limits
6650088 there is this technical imperfection if you will in the existing law that was approved by the public where in theory the city council could go and override the wishes of the public
6650089 mr lauder considers all options on the table to defend term limits
6650090 it is hard to really know where barack obamas going to really go on education
6650091 his approach has consistently been to try to ignore the politics and the factions and focus on sensible policies that have a basis in the research and let the chips fall where they may
6650092 we as a country must focus on both to address a very serious problem that we have in education in america
6650093 the solution isnt to just keep killing bad guys because there will always be more
6650094 various organizations mean different things when they refer to security an area secure enough for a soldier may not meet the needs of an afghan ngo trying to build community development
6650095 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
6650096 why should i care if doctors get a pay cut
6650097 the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
6650098 a diner in the morning a hoagie in the afternoon a bar at night
6650099 given that there have been some discrepancies regarding her age that have come to light we have asked the fig to look into this matter
6650100 it is because of these discrepancies that we have asked for this investigation to start
6650101 que diabos voc s t o fazendo na minha garag
6650102 im not saying bad liverpool teams ever won the league of course they didnt but maybe a few years ago you could afford to carry a few players
6650103 i dont think thats possible now every position has got to be filled by a top player if you want to win things on a consistent basis
6650104 the fact that the manager hasnt bought in loads of new players shows he has faith in the squad it hasnt changed much at all from last season
6650105 the year before last we finished with 68 points and last year we got 83 which represents a big step up we can all learn from the mistakes we made last year and hopefully go one step better this time
6650106 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka
6650107 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
6650108 we speak about it quite often neither of us started well and we used to say we wanted to leave
6650109 we can laugh about it now because we have both reached 100 games
6650110 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6650111 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him
6650112 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6650113 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6650114 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6650115 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
6650116 im big and beautiful and doing my best to keep my stress levels down so i can stay healthy
6650117 thats big not lazy not a glutton and certainly not deserving of the pompous poisonous disrespect served up daily to those of us with more bounce to the ounce
6650118 the state will feel good about itself for offering something and the person of size will end up paying 300 a year for the bad luck of having a chronic disease his her state sponsored insurance program failed to cover in an appropriate and meaningful fashion
6650119 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6650120 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6650121 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6650122 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6650123 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well
6650124 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6650125 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6650126 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6650127 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6650128 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6650129 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6650130 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6650131 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6650132 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores

6650137 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6650138 the one campaign isnt about taking sides its about taking action
6650139 america is saving millions of lives in the poorest parts of the world i saw it myself in zambia and tanzania
6650140 one of them is going to end up being named fay
6650141 mrs gotbaums death while tragic does not warrant criminal charges against police officers who were simply trying to carry out their duties they committed no crime
6650142 from what we know they may have been grossly negligent in how they treated her but they certainly were not acting criminally
6650143 its really cynical of them to treat their pork barrel spending in a business as usual way
6650144 this is the guy who wants to raise taxes in part because he doesnt want to cut his pork barrel
6650145 its clear that they have their own self promotional interest at heart and not the taxpayers
6650146 we have more than enough money in that account to fulfill the obligations of this year
6650147 its disturbing that there are slush funds that can be allocated for any purpose
6650148 how well do you know boomers counting down the top 10 boomer myths
6650149 contrary to many common assumptions boomers are making retirement obsolete are very savvy about advertising and are experimenting with new products

6650160 in these uncertain economic times it makes financial sense to keep existing technology products working to their maximum capabilities as well as getting the best value for your budget
6650161 these new products and price reductions let students add runtime to their work and play time perform memory and hard drive upgrades and expand desktop storage capacity and device connectivity without breaking the back to school budget

6650164 i would like to watch the film talk to our players before any announcement or anything like that is made but i did like what i saw in all three of them
6650165 jason did a great job of running so fast across the field and just made a great play on the ball
6650166 everybody wants to know who the starting quarterback will be
6650167 i dont know i have no idea everybody looks good to me
6650168 i thought i played well and i thought we played well as a unit
6650169 i thought as a unit we had been playing all right we just hadnt been scoring points finally we kind of got over that and put up 20 points in the first half which was good
6650170 hes our quarterback and i think he can play good football for us but it was good to see him validate that tonight
6650171 its the first attempt were going to wipe anyways so why bother healing the tank
6650172 better than aim in all aspects other than user base
6650173 the mccain camp is probably happy that obama is on everything and that hes the focus they want to make obama the target and make him look like a celebrity someone who is good looking young and who gives great speeches but has no substance

6650194 but the work of civil rights broadly the whole fight for the rights of the individual will continue
6650195 the largest challenge facing jesse is in a day when you have a barack in government and there are players like sharpton in civil rights are you still relevant
6650196 part of his relevance is that some of the new players out there people like me he helped mentor the question now is does he play the elder statesman in terms of living through them

6650207 che aveva suscitato i suoi dubbi e le sue fondate ironie ha ragione
6650208 is that we could suffer the same fate as argentina
6650209 we cant have strong enforcement of our clean air laws unless we know what polluters are putting into the air
6650210 the bush epa went out of its way to overturn a system that required states to adequately monitor air pollution at power plants and factories instead epa actually outlawed states from requiring monitoring good enough to protect the health of their citizens epas consistent polluter biased practices have amounted to industry foxes having a house party in the henhouse
6650211 requires that e very one of the permits issued to large factories and power plants must require adequate monitoring and that epa had failed to
6650212 today the court slapped down epas see no evil approach to the clean air act which would have eliminated emissions monitoring required by law responding to an outstanding argument by earthjustice the court understood that emission standards that arent monitored can never be enforced todays opinion is only the latest in series of decisions that have thoroughly rejected epas seven year campaign to unravel the clean air act
6650213 the federal appeals court held that communities across america have the right to know the amount of air pollution discharged by thousands of industrial sources
6650214 the court reinstated bedrock public health protections undermined by what it properly called an epa about face and sharply admonished the agency to carry out the nations clean air laws
6650215 public health should be a top priority not polluters profits
6650216 todays decision will give states back the tools they need to hold polluters accountable and help ensure that everyone has clean healthy air to breathe
6650217 do not underestimate the wit or endurance of your opponent
6650218 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6650219 it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now but people have got to understand that this will happen
6650220 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment
6650221 all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago

6650225 it looks like theyre relocating from urban areas to different positions that would enable them to control the countrys economy
6650226 there are indications that it is happening but not enough to make us believe its going as fast as it should
6650227 irish exporters suffered a 5pc price cut in the year to july as international competition intensified and the euro climbed against sterling and the dollar
6650228 prices for irish exports have now fallen by a quarter since 2000 the contrast between the falling prices received by our exporters and the massive cost increases they have to pay for government provided or regulated services is at the root of irelands competitiveness problem
6650229 i was a real bigot when it came to china i had a lot of prejudices that i had to leave behind when i came to this place
6650230 i had to learn that they have their way and their political philosophy i respect that
6650231 ive had a blast i wasnt afraid or anything im so glad i was able to embark on this journey
6650232 just another way to help them out and just another way for me to follow my passions
6650233 i wouldnt really consider myself to be particularly athletic right now
6650234 and i kind of waited a little bit and found a little quiet place and had some time to think about what happened and yeah i cried a little bit
6650235 but its tough on a relationship its tough on a marriage to be away from each other all the time
6650236 its one of things where if it works you get praised for it
6650237 and if it doesnt you dont you look like the dumb rookie
6650238 the coaches gave me their talks about how it wasnt such a good idea to go then and there
6650239 pretty much telling me i need to be on second base i remember on the first pitch i didnt go and he kind of gave me that fatherly what are you doing look
6650240 he told me to get a good walking lead and stay on my toes you never know whats going to happen
6650241 question him putting me in the game thats why hes a players manager hes going to give you that leash to hang yourself with and hes also going to give you that chance to redeem yourself
6650242 mahdollisesti niit tullaan yhdist m n mutta meid n joko br ndimme s ilyy todenn k isesti sellaisenaan koska muilla ei ole vastaavaa
6650243 olemme jo ker nneet tietoa siit mihin meid n pit isi panostaa

6650245 i think if one gold medal takes away all the pain in the world thats fake
6650246 i think i needed that growing process i needed that 10 months and i got rid of that pain on my own or with my family and my friends
6650247 you have experiences that help you to better yourself you go through them and i felt stronger in the end and i know its cliche but im happy i went through it i found out a lot about myself and a lot about my family and friends and teammates
6650248 this medal has nothing to do with whether or not healing has taken place healing had to take place in my own heart and my own mind to even get this far with that said with the team winning a gold medal im on top of the world im on cloud nine
6650249 that first game 2 0 loss norway i had a lot of nerves and i was disappointed in myself when im nervous i dont play my best it got better with each game and that last game tonight nothing no nerves were inside at all it was all confidence

6650259 virtausmittausantureiden valmistajia on maailmalla vain muutama sill tuote on vaikea rakentaa
6650260 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6650261 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6650262 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6650263 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed
6650264 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6650265 i thought the scores werent going to be as low
6650266 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6650267 i know its difficult out there and the rough is tough but that was just bad play
6650268 i like all fans of team usa am extremely disappointed with the performance of our relays today
6650269 once the games are complete we will be conducting a comprehensive review of our program the review will include assessments from inside and outside the usatf family included in this assessment will be the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6650270 people say if it hits your hand you should have it im a veteran ive never dropped the stick in my life its upsetting
6650271 its my job to get the guy the baton i did not do that
6650272 i thought he had it i let it go and he dropped it
6650273 were pleased with the six of them aside from morgan theyre not being forced to start which is what sometimes happens
6650274 scientists are telling us the climate emergency is worse than they first thought this means that every level of government has to play its part in helping averting that climate crisis
6650275 council must therefore be prepared to exert pressure on the state government to modify its pro developer policies specifically those that relate to transportation and energy
6650276 this means pressuring the iemma government to break its cosy relationship with private tollway operators and put the publics money back into boosting public transport
6650277 even in the inner west an area with a reasonable amount of public transport there are still not enough services heavy freight should be on rail there should be more light rail buses and bicycle paths
6650278 we are calling for voters to write stop the power sell off on their ballot papers at the september 13 election to help increase the pressure on the iemma government not to go ahead with the sell off for environmental job security and price reasons
6650279 we have to move to renewable energy and that will not happen if public energy utilities are sold off to be run for profit making
6650280 in the first half we werent knocking down shots but we were playing great defense and that was what allowed us to stay in the game
6650281 coach said that defense was the difference between today and two years ago
6650282 two years ago we had the same thing where we couldnt score but then we couldnt keep them from scoring but this year we found a way to play as a unit and get those stops
6650283 we always talk about offensively we are going to find a way to score enough points to win
6650284 look at the firepower we have for us our goal is to hold the other team under 60 points this russia is a team coming in so prolific on the offensive end coach said going in that she thought our defense was going to win the game for us and it came true
6650285 iemma believes that the report into the terms of the electricity sale gives him the political clout to get the liberals to support the privatisation the bigger political issue for labor however is the publics response we already know that some 85 of nsw dont want the sale to go ahead
6650286 and people are going to be even more furious about this
6650287 socialist alliance as part of the power to the people campaign is against the sell off we think that everyone involved in the campaign unions labor members greens socialists and others should now be planning to bring forward the protest set down for september 20
6650288 this would help increase the pressure on the premier and the treasurer and bolster the alp mps who have said that they will cross the floor
6650289 were never happy to lose but i think its interesting because everybody talked about how we win all the time and that nobody can compete and this just proves that teams can
6650290 i really got to tip my hat to yukiko ueno
6650291 i mean she pitched a hell of a lot the past two days and they beat us
6650292 weve faced her so many times and we were confident
6650293 she came right at us i didnt expect it two days in a row
6650294 i dont think any of us can look back on any one thing and have regrets
6650295 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into
6650296 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6650297 one of obamas biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion
6650298 we are here so that the world will know the truth
6650299 we have to remember those who died the tragic death from georgian aggression
6650300 there are cases of putting on fire houses by the georgian special command
6650301 that is their word as you know georgians are very good at provocations
6650302 the georgians or anyone who would do this are not human
6650303 i only have one favor to ask everyone who comes here
6650304 do not leave even one georgian kitten living among us because the day after it will become a tiger
6650305 after they blew everything up they shouted come out and raise your hands and we wont hurt you
6650306 this is for the heroes killed on their own land by the bloody aggressors
6650307 our battle for independence comes to its logical end before we thought we might have peaceful negotiation with the regime of georgia after august 8 it was clear this was impossible
6650308 can we live within the borders of georgia after what has happened
6650309 the people have to have at least some hope and thats what this is about
6650310 i heard it on friday morning and couldnt stop laughing hi pitch eric is the one that they use for phony phone calls a lot on the show
6650311 it was funny you seemed to take the joke well i think they aired it yesterday wed aug 13 it was when the show started they play some bits before howard goes on air
6650312 i have been receiving your messages for some time now but your recent one in which you mentioned that you have contracted lyme disease caught my eye i have been diagnosed recently may 08 apparently i have had lyme disease for over 10 years i am treating my disease through the by taking benicar and pulsing antibiotics on a regular schedule i need more information on the part of the discussion about malaria if you could send me in the right direction id be grateful thanks darlene ps i loved the yaya books i need to get the newest one

6650314 im not a very ethical guy i dont have a lot of principles but somehow that seems to me over the line juvenile diabetes has exploded half of americans dont have necks and rachaels up there saying eat some bleeping dunkin donuts you look great in that swimsuit eat another doughnut thats evil
6650315 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6650316 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6650317 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6650318 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6650319 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6650320 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6650321 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6650322 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6650323 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6650324 gt florida means family for billy corgan reports on tonights smashing pumpkins show in boca raton
6650325 one word for the show amazing the same set as usual billys dad didnt come out like it was expected billys niece came out though and sang on for martha her name is eva seriously not to sound like a sap but it was really cute the band was in fine form thankfully billy kept his shirt on this show
6650326 take this quick quiz who manages more things at once who puts more effort into their appearance who usually takes care of the details who finds it easier to meet new people who asks more questions in a conversation who is a better listener who has more interest in communication skills who is more inclined to get involved who encourages harmony and agreement who has better intuition who works with a longer to do list who enjoys a recap to the days events who is better at keeping in touch with others
6650327 he took the bulldozer with which he fed his own wife and family and used it to crush other families to death simply for being israeli jews

6650329 the only thing this weight loss book will help you lose is self esteem
6650330 mischievously confide that they gave their book its title just to sell copies which is why there are zero references to their veganism on the cover as well
6650331 you dont become a champion without being mentally and physically tough and you know what i showed up and got it done
6650332 i said nothing is going to get in my way i said before the race this is my domain and im going to get it done
6650333 i ran the best i could i just didnt have anything at the end im disappointed it happens its a long season i started back in february its now august the body can only take so much
6650334 that was the only thing i could think of and it got me the bronze it was a last second decision i had to go for it
6650335 thats the game plan to finish out my career here
6650336 the steelers have been good to me and i have put all my heart and soul into this so ill just try to close it out
6650337 and i kind of waited a little bit and found a little quiet place and had some time to think about what happened and yeah i cried a little bit
6650338 but its tough on a relationship its tough on a marriage to be away from each other all the time
6650339 if youre gonna survive out here youve got to know
6650340 arrangement lamiable entre les autorit s et les parties concern es
6650341 undermine the very thing youre trying to promote by getting them hooked on the rewards
6650342 but when i got elected to the executive board of the players association i told gene i need you to be the player rep
6650343 because i saw those qualities that other people hadnt seen i knew right away that gene had the leadership and qualities to be a leader on and off the football field thats why we picked him as one of the captains of the team
6650344 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6650345 when i think about gene upshaw i think about no 63 pulling
6650346 a lot of people called it highway 63 thats what i remember and i know about gene because when he pulled around that left side he got in like a hurricane coming through wiped out everything that was there
6650347 gene was tough he just felt he couldnt get beat he had the determination to be the very best and when we drafted him mr davis knew that he would be the very best
6650348 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6650349 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6650350 a guy like delamielleure says the things he said about me you think im going to invite him to dinner no im going to break his damn neck
6650351 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6650352 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6650353 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6650354 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game in the big picture
6650355 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him our hearts go out to terri and the boys

6650370 yeah were going to go old school buddy ryan as they call it around here
6650371 it is ludicrous for anyone to accuse us of building market rate housing or pushing through projects that the community does not want
6650372 weve never done any project that the local community board did not approve all our housing is 100 percent affordable there are just different degrees of affordable to build 100 percent low income housing you need a ton of subsidies try going to the city and state for that level of funding and believe me theyll look at you like youre crazy
6650373 one should not relegate harlem to housing just for the poor
6650374 the claims that we have been responsible for gentrification or whatever you want to call it are usually made by people absolutely ignorant of our work or jealous of our work
6650375 we are really keeping to our mission the other market forces coming into harlem are things which most of us have no control over we dont own the real estate
6650376 when exactly were the arc and the grail proven to have existed
6650377 ive had a blast i wasnt afraid or anything im so glad i was able to embark on this journey
6650378 just another way to help them out and just another way for me to follow my passions
6650379 i wouldnt really consider myself to be particularly athletic right now

6650386 there is no other program like it available in the americas
6650387 surfing is a multimillion dollar business i believe it would bring more experienced people into the industry
6650388 everybody can surf but not everybody knows the business behind how surf companies are run
6650389 i think very few people know how surfing contests are run and how to run them efficiently effectively and fairly
6650390 surfing has always been a countercultural activity so to my mind as it gets more institutionalized it loses some of its soul
6650391 the impact of global warming is brutal and tragic for polar bears
6650392 the only way to limit the number of bears that will drown and starve is to reduce greenhouse gas pollution immediately
6650393 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6650394 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6650395 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6650396 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6650397 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6650398 no one is the same you cant compare yourself to other people because everyone is different

6650401 i was afraid they would cut my trees down or kill them
6650402 i hoped the bad press would make them back off
6650403 i knew if i went to condemnation court i would have no bargaining power at all
6650404 all parties are satisfied with the agreement and ms horton was very pleasant
6650405 parliament house is a work place the members of parliament should not be able to drink freely during working hours
6650406 having a bar serving alcohol during working hours is completely out of step with community expectations
6650407 it is completely unacceptable that members of parliament are able to sit in a bar in their workplace and drink when they should be working on behalf of the community
6650408 parliament house is a work place the members of parliament should not be able to drink freely during working hours
6650409 having a bar serving alcohol during working hours is completely out of step with community expectations
6650410 i really shouldnt be eating here b c im supposed to be on a diet
6650411 theres more people at a montreal canadiens home game than there is in the whole of williams lake
6650412 i took a few trips down to vernon ive been team roping with bobby lewis its fun
6650413 i go in there every morning and work out my goalie coach is there too eli wilson hes the ottawa goalie coach after the workout we go and skate with him for two hours
6650414 i skate with a whole bunch of other pros jason labarbera hes from prince george and plays for the kings chris mason was there he plays with nashville kevin nastiuk hes in the carolina system jeff glass he was the world junior goalie before me hes in the ottawa system linden rowat who plays for regina was out there too
6650415 you have to shake off the rust a little bit the first three ice times i felt like i didnt know what i was doing out there you give it a week or two and you start to feel normal again
6650416 during the summer i stay away from carbohydrates and try to stay away from pastas and bread especially white bread i have a whole wheat bagel in the mornings before my workout
6650417 thats what i like about anahim lake you can go fishing right in our back yard in corkscrew creek pull out a couple of trout and fry those up for dinner
6650418 i picked up quite a bit but im not fluent in it yet
6650419 i hang around with the younger french guys like lapierre and latendresse
6650420 its a lot of fun its definitely the best place to play when youre playing hockey the montreal fans really get into it as soon as we get to camp theres a buzz around the city especially this year being the centennial year it should be a lot of fun
6650421 i didnt know if i was going to make the team at the start of camp i had a good year the year before i just came to camp hoping id make the team then bob gainey decided to keep me there then i went through a slump right around christmas things werent going too well so i went down to hamilton i was still struggling a little bit for two weeks then during the second half of my month long stint in hamilton it started to pick up again they brought me back to montreal and everything started to roll from there and things started going really well then they traded chris huet to washington and it was like getting tossed into the fire
6650422 when the trade deadline came and passed everybody kind of relaxed a little bit we all knew this was our team for the rest of the year it took all the pressure off and we started to play really well we went on a pretty good roll there from the trade deadline to the end of the year
6650423 we did well against them all year we took it to them for the first couple of games and then they started playing well and it kind of seesawed back and forth and we won the seventh game
6650424 we just couldnt get any breaks we must have hit two posts a game thats just the way it went it was fun though especially in the playoffs
6650425 everybodys going that much harder eighty two games is a long year its a lot of games when you hit about 72 games you just want to get the regular season over with you want to get into a groove right before the playoffs and get it over with
6650426 i have a helmet on when im playing but every once in a while you have someone who recognizes you a bit but other than that not really
6650427 i dont think much about it im a guy who just runs with everything whatever happens happens
6650428 he scored on me but i stopped him on a breakaway we had a pretty good chuckle over that one
6650429 i think we need a little veteran presence theres just me and yaro 21 and 23 years old that was it there was just us two young guys and i think bob gainey figured to bring in somebody a little bit older to have around the room
6650430 youve got to show up in camp in the best shape possible im starting to feel pretty good now but youve got to keep pushing yourself all the way to camp
6650431 meanwhile my trainer sends me something to do every day usually it takes me two and a half hours to get through a workout running doing the elliptical riding the bike doing weights with your legs upper body core a whole bunch of core workouts to do
6650432 you dont come to training camp to get into shape any more youve got to come to training camp in shape its a little different than it used to be
6650433 you miss it after a while during the off season youre gone from the game for four or five months and you start to miss it
6650434 you go strolling with cowboy boots on and everybody looks at you funny
6650435 its what every player works for is a starting position
6650436 cory taught me a lot of things last year and it was nice that i got to be in a backup role and got a little bit of experience and im definitely looking forward to this season
6650437 suffering and sacrifice were required to pull off the aug 8 opening which involved wrangling nearly 15 000 cast and crew only north korea could have done it better
6650438 is it any wonder that he chose another communist country which has the ability to select imprison and force to work their populace as the only other which could have done this in his own words about working in the united states with an opera in new york city
6650439 end the annual release of 500 000 pounds of lead into the environment in california which occurs when wheel weights break off of automobile wheels
6650440 with the high expectations and people thinking were going to do well that doesnt mean youll just automatically win games and be better
6650441 we have to improve in practice and we have to get better as a team
6650442 but i think having a lot of people come back this year and then playing them last year losing i think well be better knowing what kinds of teams they are and just be a little bit better make less mistakes this year
6650443 the biggest thing during that stretch is the injury part of it
6650444 its awfully physical football throughout the regular season and especially once you go up against a harrisburg and a lennox and a dell rapids in that stretch and we need to come out of that stretch healthy and come out of that stretch with a couple of wins
6650445 its just we have to have the mindset and keep the mindset that we can do it like last year nobody ever thought we were ever going to win a state championship but everyone on our team knew we could do it and we went out there and did it
6650446 material will not be distributed or posted unless it has been approved
6650447 clearly if we distribute and allow the argus leader in our schools and the time magazine or world news and report or whatever magazine you might find in our library or classrooms than were saying with the concern raised this year perhaps we should sit down and look at do we need a policy dealing with any publication we have with paid advertisement
6650448 it is not something that we go through and do page by page approval on the activity and action interaction between us and the shopping news this year was the same it has been for the last 16 years and i think thats important
6650449 we will sit down and look at it and say perhaps we need to establish a policy that reflects any publication including newspapers that have paid advertisements in them
6650450 solid edge already has the ability to read and write autocad dwg and dxf files
6650451 however this ability is severely limited to 2d dwg dxf files only when im
6650452 my whole career has been about people and this is a great way to say thanks to the people ive worked with and get an opportunity to say goodbye to them
6650453 when i started in the business there was this little company building a 10 microwave hop between chicago and st louis called microwave communications inc which they then shorted to mci and the rest is history as they say
6650454 its meant a lot for consumer choice for customers for us it means a lot of turmoil because when you start out and have all the local customers and now customers have options youre bound to lose market share
6650455 weve got a lot of young people vibrant people doing a lot of great work for us and ill miss them
6650456 the first thing would be somebody actually knocking on your door most legitimate asphalt paving companies arent going to be looking for business going door to door
6650457 people who are looking to scam other people arent going to have the necessary permits
6650458 i wouldnt pay them up front id wait until the work is completed because once you pay them thats a pretty good chance they wont show back up
6650459 the u s military is the most letahl killing machine in the world
6650460 behaviour was offensive and inappropriate for his host countrys culture
6650461 they bring experience new ideas and new enthusiasm everyones excited rejuvenated
6650462 hockeys been my life and its probably one of the easiest things i can do without and i say this lightly thinking about it
6650463 when an athlete retires the transition is always difficult you start to think who am i so the easiest thing to do is get back into the game
6650464 he asked me if i would be interested in the position and i was sort of looking to slow down i had traveled a lot with my work needless to say i was very interested
6650465 i want to give the opportunity to the kids in the area to look forward to something to play after their minor hockey when theyre graduating up into the upper leagues and be a competitive and spirited team for people coming to watch good hockey
6650466 we have good executive management we brought in ric we have guy and general manager dave hill im confident theyre going to do a great job for us and bring the stoney creek hamilton area a positive outlook for the future
6650467 there was some internal stuff that went on and im not sure what that is so their finish wasnt as great unfortunately and that depletes everything not only the confidence level of the team or the management but also the confidence level of the fans
6650468 and i cant say what other people have done because i wasnt in the dressing room what i can say is they are kids most of them but we want them to know that if theyre coming to play here its not just to kill time theyre going to come to practice and theyre going to be there for a specific reason if they dont produce and i dont mean goal scoring but if they dont produce through effort and dont work with the system then well have some issues
6650469 we have close to 80 kids coming out which is great
6650470 the pressure is just to see if we can pick the right guys unfortunately you might miss some and you might make some mistakes and thats part of life but at the end of the day were just moving forward
6650471 but i dont see that as being realistic i would love it to happen dont get me wrong but what we will do is well build a foundation a winning attitude so that other teams stepping onto the ice know theyre going to have their hands full and thats all i want a team thats going to compete every night
6650472 its not all about the ice its about weaving ourselves into the community
6650473 weve had communications with stoney creek minor hockey and are trying to see if we can develop coaches clinics bring players out to do talks and so on to get kids to understand there is hockey locally to move up in and we would like to see that and eventually put ourselves in a position to help them with educational packages or moving on to an ohl team
6650474 we changed the logo to reflect something thats more modernized and something that we hope will attract more youth to come to the games
6650475 it has a little more of a warrior look and feel to it
6650476 we have contacts through the nhl players association through alumni so hes coming as a favour to us
6650477 we really want to make it a great night for everybody
6650478 you tax less what we want more income for families savings investment and you shift these
6650479 we wanted to bring a deserving rider up from the amateur ranks through our relationship with waste management
6650480 were happy to give kiel this opportunity and i hope that he becomes a successful long term addition to the team
6650481 placing someone in the pro peloton proves their form is sound and im thankful for our relationship with jelly belly
6650482 we hope to do even better in 2009 for both the sponsors and the riders

6650495 el asunto es que ellos est n esperando molestia o verg enza en las mujeres pero no est n esperando agradecimiento y una sonrisa
6650496 uy negrita usted es la mujer mas bonita que he visto desde que llegu a costa rica
6650497 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6650498 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong but if youre like me and you got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6650499 theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccain s world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6650500 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6650501 the question isnt how many homes mccain has but how many homes does mccain have where he got a sweetheart deal involving tony rezko
6650502 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
6650503 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
6650504 no that is not true we have not pulled out of the champions trophy but we have advised the icc about our considerable concern and we have made sure that they understand that we will not go anywhere which is not safe we are waiting to hear from them later this evening
6650505 ca at this stage hasnt made any official decision to not tour we are waiting to hear from icc the ball is in their court
6650506 we are very willing to tour pakistan we are very keen to do so and we will visit pakistan as long as the safety and security advisors say that it is safe
6650507 the only issue that is important for us is the safety and security of the players and the advice we get from our range of sources
6650508 like z it describes all structures in space and time with a minimal toolkit of mathematical notions

6650511 the series 60 platform for touchscreen user interface and a mobile device is expected to be launched by the year end
6650512 before today no i had never used a fire extinguisher before but i kind of always wondered how they worked
6650513 ya know weve never been exposed to this i guess the good news is none of us have had any experience with fire extinguishers and when i was approached with this i thought this was a pretty good deal
6650514 sweep at the base of the flame and move in just a little bit good job
6650515 you can see what happens when your extinguisher dies out
6650516 we had air quality we had to deal with we were putting out black smoke we had ground quality because we sometimes hit the pan and blow the grease all over the ground
6650517 its the old saying its never going to happen to me but we know it does
6650518 you take a look around and theres a lot of potential for fire so definitely good experience
6650519 behind every successful man there is a woman telling him he is wrong
6650520 hi how is everybody doing today i am tommy and this is sheri
6650521 we have got about 12 to 14 properties we are going to see today we are going to try to keep moving very quickly
6650522 i had no idea that in such a nice location i could get a house for a price that is half of what it was just three years back
6650523 a lot of these foreclosures dont even have signs up saying that they are foreclosures and they are gone in a day
6650524 so its difficult to find them and when we do its hard to work with the banks to get our contracts approved so we decided that if it was that hard for us to do how hard it was for everybody else to do it
6650525 they make it very organized and its kind of fun you know to go on the buses to see all the properties
6650526 it does save me a lot of time instead of actually contacting all the agents to go through these properties
6650527 if you put it into a light where you look at this house and you say somebody used to live there and they lost their home and they lost everything its really hard
6650528 but we want to make it an enjoyable experience and fun and a great opportunity for new people to have a home themselves that maybe couldnt afford a home three years ago
6650529 yes there is a sad story involved if you are to see a foreclosed house but if you really look at it from an investment perspective you know its like any other business
6650530 la historia escrita por la nasa est llena de mentiras
6650531 la lotta uno sport virile e naturale avere ferite o infortuni
6650532 lui una nave e noi delle barche e tu devi trovare la tua rotta attorno a questo gigante
6650533 ero semplicemente sulla traiettoria la palla mi ha colpito al mento
6650534 ho semplicemente corso a occhi chiusi fino ai 150 metri
6650535 qualcuno ha detto che siamo gi felici di essere qui non cos noi abbiamo degli obiettivi da raggiungere
6650536 behind every successful man there is a woman telling him he is wrong
6650537 has the experience and credentials to move our newsroom toward the future
6650538 at redeye she has demonstrated a true understanding of the newspapers audience and im happy that she will bring that expertise to the chicago tribune and its readers
6650539 one of the most revealing insights from recent research is how little excitement some people feel about their daily encounter with us
6650540 many of our regular readers regard us like the electric company or water utility
6650541 comcast has made no final decisions on how to manage network congestion despite news reports wednesday that it will slow traffic for heavy users for up to 20 minutes during times of peak network use
6650542 in light of the tightening polls does barack obama now have to go negative against john mccain
6650543 obama hasnt been doing the safe thing throughout this whole election
6650544 ive been listening to steves podcasts and following both the gillmor gang and newsgang live for
6650545 behind every successful man there is a woman telling him he is wrong
6650546 we are moving very strongly to help improve housing affordability but there arent magical solutions or overnight solutions to a problem thats developed over some time
6650547 this government is determined to support veterans and ex serving personnel who may suffer psychologically as a result of their service
6650548 however to do so we need a better understanding of the incidence and characteristics of suicide amongst this community
6650549 we know that war service can have both physical and mental impact on the lives of service personnel
6650550 physical impairment can be obvious psychological injury is less so
6650551 there is incredible enthusiasm for barack obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6650552 we can assure our supporters these texts did not come from the campaign and their data is secure everyone can also rest easy that despite their popularity mickey mouse and michael phelps are not on the short list at this time
6650553 we are proud to help cause confusion and excitement during this terrible boring week of no news at all
6650554 but we cant really take too much credit for it apparently one of our readers listens to which is still on the radio and heard of the veep txt hoax and figured out an easy way to do it through
6650555 so many of my so called friends have sent hoax texts to me now
6650556 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6650557 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6650558 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6650559 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6650560 it could go back for miles and miles and theres no real mechanism to stop it
6650561 its rather like reading a book that seems familiar and realising that you have read it all before
6650562 they are not trying to take cities but this is a strategic offensive to gain as much ground as possible in the gap between the us presidential election and the next administration getting into office
6650563 they want to paralyse the afghan government create a crisis within nato and force the west to negotiate in the spring
6650564 the police officials and mps are afraid to go out into the districts because they are all in taliban hands
6650565 even in the district centres authority does not stretch outside the official compounds
6650566 the afghan people have long doubted such claims of foreigners especially of britain and america and their trust about crushing al qaeda and terrorism has fallen
6650567 u s forces start with a built in challenge because of their reputation for accomplishment what some call the man on the moon syndrome this refers to the expressed disbelief that a nation able to put a man on the moon cannot quickly restore basic services
6650568 in some cultures failure to deliver promised results is automatically interpreted as deliberate deception rather than good intentions gone awry
6650569 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6650570 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6650571 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6650572 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6650573 i keep getting offers and i keep saying the same thing sorry no
6650574 sure enough during the interview a toronto man approaches state to ask if hed
6650575 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6650576 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6650577 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6650578 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6650579 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

6650583 the swimmers finished earlier in the week and it was like there was an eruption
6650584 its so amazing to have access to so many pictures and everything pretty much my life is up there
6650585 i type the password again and again and again and i realize something is wrong with the company itself or the server or the e mail account
6650586 let a man state his understanding of the nature of man and he will state what he thinks of jesus christ and his work both truths stand or fall together
6650587 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6650588 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6650589 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6650590 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6650591 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6650592 i want you to stand up and give us the occupation of your father spell it and say one thing he would give us all if he was here today
6650593 my father is a banker b a n k e r and if he was here today he would give us all a shiny new penny
6650594 my father is a baker b a k e r and if he was here today he would give us all a freshly baked cookie
6650595 my father is an accountant a k no wait a c k no
6650596 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6650597 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6650598 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6650599 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6650600 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6650601 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6650602 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6650603 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6650604 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6650605 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6650606 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6650607 i am tired there are no reasons for everything in the world
6650608 here is the question if you can answer and convince my heart i will change my mind lets say i want a flower located on the face of a mountain cliff and we both are sure that picking the flower will cause your death will you do it for me
6650609 i would not pick that flower for you but please allow me to explain the reasons further

6650658 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

6650667 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6650668 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6650669 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6650670 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6650671 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6650673 verticolabia the disliking of short people as dating options is a systemic problem across society
6650674 ethics is how we behave when we decide we belong together
6650675 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6650676 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6650677 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6650678 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6650679 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6650680 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6650681 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6650682 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6650683 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6650684 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6650685 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6650686 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6650687 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6650688 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6650689 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6650690 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6650691 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6650692 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6650693 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6650694 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6650695 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

6650698 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6650699 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6650700 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6650701 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6650702 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6650703 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6650704 who are open to doing something on the production side
6650705 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6650706 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6650707 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6650708 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6650709 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6650710 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6650711 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6650712 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6650713 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

6650724 unfortunately some of the big polluting industries and corporations dont want to take responsibility for reducing their emissions and are seeking exemptions from the carbon pollution reduction scheme
6650725 it is a selfish and short sighted approach on their part
6650726 were concerned that there is no responsible business voice out there
6650727 weve seen a lot of special pleading from business but weve seen no plan about how they want to be here in 20 years time with a low carbon output
6650728 some of the businesses have genuine trade exposure and they will get assistance
6650729 what we are concerned about is putting a carbon protection wall around a lot of the big polluters and making the rest of us do all the work

6650796 when uk native james blackshaw plays his 12 string guitar something spiritual takes place performing and recording since 2003 his name is frequently mentioned as one of the foremost modern solo acoustic guitarists now at the age of 25 blackshaw an untrained musician born and still residing in the suburban environs of greater london draws as much inspiration from early religious music south asian folk music and composers such as arvo part simeon ten holt steve reich and charlemagne palestine as he does from john fahey robbie basho and the early takoma records roster constantly breaking boundaries in what could be conceived as a somewhat limited medium in his part improvised and part written songs blackshaw makes expert use of eastern and western scales chord changes reminiscent of european classical music and incredibly intricate fingerpicking patterns to make a sound that is both challengingly minimalist yet warm and approachable to anybody who might hear it with a rare sensitivity that conveys immense beauty hope and sadness

6650812 though dead raven choir manoeuvres here within the more restrained corners of the bm spectrum the spirit that pervades selenoclast wolves is undeniably black this long awaited album from the enigmatic ethereal conjurer smolken comprises six brand new odes as well as the entire nine track lesbian corpse wolves album reworked as a generous bonus the latter was originally released on cdr in 2003 limited to a mere 30 copies so all 15 tracks hereon will represent a new experience to most listeners for those who dont know the individual behind drc smolken is a schizoid performer alternating between raw black metal and avant garde neo folk selenoclast wolves focuses on the latter facet of his muse with lyrics borrowed from a host of eclectic poets including pugilist and ear biter extraordinaire mike tyson i am not a recluse you should know already that you are in the realm of the truly bizarre residing once more in his native poland after spending some time in texas smolken is one of the undergrounds most prolific creators he allegedly recorded about ten albums in the four years leading up to 2004 all of which had the word wolves included somewhere in the title and most of which were available only on cdr that mainstay of non commerciality drc also released a triple vinyl retrospective collection of its entire black metal catalogue last year but this vanished quicker than a condom in a whorehouse eerier than mick jaggers pulling power and creepier than a paedophiles smile the ghostly rumblings of selenoclast wolves are designed to fuck with your mind deceptively accessible this is nonetheless as unique a dosage of extreme dementia as you could wish to encounter the promotional jargon stresses folk influences and the presence of acoustic guitars bass fiddle troll cittern cello banjo mandolin and piano as well as many spoken passages and the overall earthy vibe backs this up emphatically but another accurate description of drcs bewitching output as evidenced here might be unplugged black or acoustic black its i refer generally to the first six songs definitely got the cold dirty heart of black metal but without any emphasis on electrics pounding percussion or aggression leading to a bizarre mix of pagan tunes laid back sensibilities and naked angst delightfully understated and carefree opening shots the silence and january work subtly at the emotions setting a surreal tone that magnifies and amplifies the further we venture into the myriad chambers of smolkens mind though the waters are calm a sense of menace lurks close to the surface not unlike the movie deliverance and there is a foreboding feeling that all is genuinely not well closer to nick cave than darkthrone selenoclast wolves possesses a seedy slimy underbelly that erupts during the disturbing tyson inspired rant that ends the first movement of this release like iron mike in his physical prime this one will lay you out cold theres a clear change of tact for the nine bonus tracks which are even more subdued with abundant female vocals some of these songs remind me of pj harvey or bjork perhaps antimatter or the gathering even there are also strong hints of william blake era ulver perceptible in both male and female deliveries as the pace drops close to that of a snails funeral a multifaceted volume shows its two faces thats smolken for you quite the trickster

6650840 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6650841 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6650842 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6650843 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6650844 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice

6650846 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

6650868 now the old king is dead long live the king
6650869 wed love to be a lot more consistent theres no doubt about that
6650870 but i think if we had the answer as to why we wouldve done it already and wed be a lot higher up on the table
6650871 i think were renowned for the fact were going to try some things and things arent going to for us all that time
6650872 we just need to have the strength of mind to know to keep going and to keep building away
6650873 i think in the past weve made the mistake when things go against us we tend to try and play catch up footy and touch football rather than building the pressure and building a game again
6650874 its something we need to learn from and there s no bigger test than this week
6650875 its going to be a really tough test for us and well be able to see where were at and if were any chance of making this top eight
6650876 the army and police arrested a suspected bomber not far away from scene of the attack
6650877 they also recovered a suicide jacket from a nearby mosque and seized explosives
6650878 the army has killed hundreds of innocent people and we attacked it to teach it a lesson
6650879 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6650880 even if you have to sit together for a week
6650881 the threat that we are facing today has no precedent
6650882 our enemy lurks silently within our society this is our war
6650883 look we already said were going to get it and we will go get ice cream once you stop asking
6650884 really we are just going to back ourselves to play and whichever defenders on him just back him in to do the best job they can
6650885 we will have no emphasis on keeping it off him specifically or trying to change hawthorn in the way they want to play
6650886 if he kicks his 100th goal and were 18 goals to six up i think our boys wont be too fussed
6650887 id expect glassy will pick him up at the start
6650888 i think glassy can do a good job hes a good defender a very good player and thats why we back him in
6650889 it was a sad moment but it went quietly to sleep
6650890 he felt really lonely and he wanted to be with his mother and family
6650891 it was suffering extremely so weve had to make the very difficult decision
6650892 ive always tried to do what i can to let the guys see me as a quote unquote football player
6650893 guys see that i want to work just as hard as everybody else does the most important thing is when you step on the field are you somebody they can count on
6650894 when you stand around and watch practice which i do a lot of its amazing the talent level that weve been able to get to in such a short time
6650895 right now its easy for us as players to have that expectation level as high as it is because weve seen the work that weve done up to now
6650896 the outcome of a game often hangs on the performance of a player who is only slightly more involved with the team than the guy who drives the bus
6650897 im only out on the field for maybe 30 seconds 45 seconds
6650898 take that entire time and enjoy it enjoy every single second youre out there because thats why you play the game
6650899 a funny thing happened on the way to the forum

6650904 the minister has asked his department to explore the provenance of these objects and potential avenues for their acquisition
6650905 prime minister kevin rudd should use his relationship with british prime minister gordon brown to convince the uk government to purchase the boomerang and donate it to australia in a gesture of friendship and to mark our shared heritage
6650906 the boomerang should be returned to kurnell as a symbol of that first meeting and so all australians have the opportunity to see it
6650907 having the boomerang back in kurnell will be an historic symbol of harmony between our two cultures and will help teach young australians about the importance of aboriginal culture

6650910 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6650911 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6650912 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6650913 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

6650923 you actually have to talk with them to find out why they dropped out and i think thats the part the students like the most
6650924 my paycheck id buy an outfit and id be broke
6650925 but the other side is theyre going to have a life that goes with it
6650926 at 5ft 9in without her shoes carla already towers over her husband and with the eyes of the world upon her she had to choose her footwear tactfully so although nicolas sarkozy wore a pair of dressy shoes with a chunky heel the french first lady chose pumps he also stayed one step behind and above her as they stepped off the plane
6650927 sophie towered over jamie even though she was only wearing flip flops
6650928 height is one of those things you cant do a whole lot about its a bit like colour if my boyfriend was black i doubt very much there would have been such a vocal response to our coupling because thats out of bounds
6650929 oh dont be daft she can only be about 4ft 10in tall
6650930 find out who your true friends are have 2 close friends not 6 okay friends
6650931 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6650932 so far everything that has been received demonstrates we have no problem for the eligibility of the competitors
6650933 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6650934 it was an immensely stupid thing to have done and i regret it enormously i have never used any drugs before or since
6650935 i was walking to meet a friend and was approached as is not uncommon in any city and offered cannabis
6650936 normally i would ignore this and walk straight on but for some reason i foolishly and impulsively decided to stop and buy some cannabis when i was offered something else i have no explanation but i decided to buy something else as well
6650937 i put them in my bag and immediately regretted this
6650938 i had no intention of using the ecstasy and why i didnt immediately throw this away i have asked myself so many times one does not expect to find oneself in this kind of situation
6650939 we have carefully considered the circumstances surrounding the caution and your actions thereafter
6650940 you are a young doctor at the start of your career from the beginning you have been open and honest about the caution and the circumstances surrounding it
6650941 you have admitted to using a small amount of cannabis at the festival
6650942 you have told the panel that you had not used any of the mdma ecstasy and had no intention of doing so
6650943 it was an isolated incident occurring over one year ago
6650944 the number of seizures of counterfeit vodka is increasing but unfortunately it only touches on what is coming in through the back door
6650945 consumers dont tell us about them because they think theyre on to a bargain but it is a lose lose situation and i would urge people not to touch it
6650946 this stuff can be made for pennies and the people behind it put more money into the labelling than what is inside
6650947 since the european union expanded to the east last year we have seen a lot more coming into our region because once bottles are within eu borders they can travel through unhindered
6650948 thousands of people have been killed by consumption of this in russia and the former soviet bloc
6650949 the counterfeiters are always trying to keep one step ahead of us but were fighting back working with our partners and improving intelligence and i believe its a battle we can win
6650950 the magnitude of the improvement has been a little bit of a surprise
6650951 theyve broken through in some sports that we thought it would be very hard for them to win medals in
6650952 we better learn how to develop real teams in ping pong and badminton and some other sports where they dominate
6650953 they didnt know what the sport was 10 years ago
6650954 theyre taking it out of the hides of the rest of the world
6650955 in 10 years we have achieved what european and north american countries worked on for 40 to 50 years
6650956 its not as relaxed or as easy as you think
6650957 actually we worked very hard and trained very hard every day we train from morning to night
6650958 it got me so worked up so i guess this method worked
6650959 the thing i think you can see in the faces of chinese athletes is theyre having fun out there
6650960 if they break through in those medal opportunities in track and field and swimming where weve traditionally been dominant and relied on them for 50 to 60 of the medals for the united states team then well have a much more difficult time obviously to maintain the total medal count
6650961 can do everything the sport demands a lot of 6 9 guys can hit the snot out of the ball but they cant set like he does or have the great hands and skills he does
6650962 the only way youre going to get things done is have a target
6650963 were ready willing and able to work towards getting a development agreement done by oct 1 it will take a lot of work on both sides
6650964 i know what it was like to betrayed come let me heal you
6650965 its unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation anz chief executive mike smith said
6650966 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers
6650967 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down he said
6650968 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6650969 it amp squo s unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation amp squo amp squo anz chief executive mike smith said

6650972 the social stigma of the child being born outside marriage
6650973 officials will work very closely with federal and state agencies to investigate these claims
6650974 the minister has asked his department to explore the provenance of these objects and potential avenues for their acquisition mr garretts spokesman ben pratt said
6650975 the boomerang should be returned to kurnell as a symbol of that first meeting and so all australians have the opportunity to see it
6650976 having the boomerang back in kurnell will be an historic symbol of harmony between our two cultures and will help teach young australians about the importance of aboriginal culture he said
6650977 a defeat at that end of the world would be a defeat for french troops
6650978 everyone knows that terrorism is particularly fed by what is happening in afghanistan
6650979 i want the families to know everything they have that right
6650980 no french soldier during the incident came on the radio to complain that they were taking friendly fire
6650981 no french soldier after the incident has reported through the chain of command that might have been the case none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordinance
6650982 because the forces were very interlocked the taliban insurgents and the french forces there would have of course been collateral damage if the bombs had been deployed
6650983 schools are asking for more and its gone beyond the absurd i just think somebody needs to stop it or its going to get worse
6650984 these are more suggestions than mandates and our principals are totally flexible about it
6650985 its like your sending your kid to private school with the cost of uniforms supplies and packs of notebook paper
6650986 you hear people grumbling about it every year all you have to do is go to wal mart and stand at the end of the supply aisle
6650987 does the supply monster come in and eat them up
6650988 you dont have to go out and buy everything new
6650989 southwest airlines has the best deals this year for sure
6650990 the key task for policy makers going forward is to ensure that older people can increasingly play an active role in our ageing society
6650991 the days of assuming older people are dependants must now come to an end
6650992 we want to receive input from as many south carolinians as possible
6650993 we are committed to continuing an open dialogue with communities across the state
6650994 i do think that to be changing in the middle of the stream can be very inconvenient not only for the institutions but for the students
6650995 we dont have all the deadlines we dont know how this is going to come through with insurance and fema
6650996 de wildwalstraat is onderdeel van de centrumbuurt een buurt die doelbewust met smalle straten is ingericht om de snelheid van autos te temperen en kinderen zo veilig mogelijk te kunnen laten spelen naar wij hebben begrepen staat de gemeente nu voor dat de autos vanaf de frankhuizerallee op de wildwalstraat terecht komen daar de kinderen uit of in laten stappen en dat deze autos vervolgens via de schaapskooistraat en de houtwalstraat weer de frankhuizerallee op rijden
6650997 naar aanleiding van de ons inziens terechte zorgen van de bewoners de ogenschijnlijk simpele manier waarop die zorgen kunnen worden weggenomen en het bij de wijkbewoners opkomende gevoel dat de gemeente onverkort star zal vasthouden aan de gemaakte keus wil het cda het college de volgende vragen voorleggen 1
6650998 every single one of these patients were into end of life issues
6650999 we did a detailed review of every death we had we did not find any care issues
6651000 its information but you have to be careful with that information
6651001 it makes me question the data of the whole region
6651002 heart failure is the no 1 disease among medicare recipients
6651003 its about keeping john mccain from sweeping the south thats the key
6651004 the economy and national security are neck and neck for me
6651005 in fact im not even sure they are separate issues
6651006 i just havent really understood what mccains position is on that but it needs to be controlled
6651007 senator obama has a great deal of work to do if he plans to turn the southern states in his favor
6651008 for older americans i think color is still an issue
6651009 i am pleased the executive board took this opportunity to finally do the right thing regarding the program
6651010 there is no need to rehash what wasnt done to protect the program by the board that is evident
6651011 businesses do it families do it we think governments should do it that way
6651012 i think theres certainly some within the caucus who would prefer us to go back and do more measured cuts
6651013 if we go back well probably get smacked around for going back in
6651014 theres nothing here but a few two by fours attached to a massive expanse of drywall then i see it a small white plaque with black lettering that reads jackson pollock american 1912 1956
6651015 it is a rare practice for a university to list its company secretarys address what more it is registered in the british virgin islands
6651016 it was a very tough day and i had various injuries but it is the olympics and you have to give it everything and go for gold i gave it everything ive fallen off gotten back up fallen off and got back up again i gave it my best shot i am 19 and there is so much more to come im hurting
6651017 it was a very tough day for shanaze but she will learn and come back even stronger
6651018 we always aim for gold and try do what it takes and occasionally it will backfire on us but shanaze is a fantastic talent and at only 19 has at least three olympics ahead of her in bmx and on the track there was a lot of pressure and expectation on her this time and she will have learned a lot
6651019 i know for sure what jesus would not do would be to sweep into a community gather up large numbers of people separate them from one another and deport them to another country in my own mind in my own conscience thats crystal clear jesus would not do that

6651023 the university of iowa museum of art likely will never return to its flood damaged home on the iowa rivers west bank ui president sally mason said
6651024 now that the waters have receded ui vice provost tom rocklin said if the museum has to move it might come down to money a big concern is where the funding is going to come from he said at this point the university has made no plans on funding because of that and other concerns rocklin said officials have not made a formal decision yet on whether the museum will be relocated first we need to get a full understanding of risks at the current location he said if the move is found to be the best outcome interim art museum director pamela white said fundraising will be required she believes though that keeping the art safe trumps cost effectiveness
6651025 with the ui museum of art having faced so much destruction in the flood the best move it can make is to move

6651035 the holocaust is not merely a story of destruction and loss it is a remarkable story of the human spirit and the life that flourished before the holocaust struggled during its darkest hours and ultimately prevailed as survivors rebuilt their lives

6651039 youre not half as good as you think you are
6651040 a lot of the young players in australia strut around with the attitude that theyre as good as mark viduka and harry kewell when in reality they might only have played a handful of a league games
6651041 confidence is a good thing but it has to be founded on something tangible
6651042 you can have all the potential in the world but whats the point if youre not prepared to put in the hard work
6651043 many australian boys think they are the complete package when they cant even duplicate what damian mori managed with a goal every other game in the national competition
6651044 and remember mori wasnt good enough to make it overseas
6651045 newcastles joel griffiths is a great player for the a league but he couldnt play as a striker for either neuchatel or leeds people have to appreciate the differences between here and europe
6651046 our youngsters need to take on the board the saying the harder i work the luckier i get because a lot of them dont know what hard work is
6651047 before the 2004 olympics frank farina said to me in one of the most accurate statements ive heard from anybody bern the biggest problem with the young boys coming through is they act like theyve won the world cup champions league and premier league and they have done nothing
6651048 they give kids the impression they are superstars in the making and everything is inevitable for them
6651049 the idea of having a dismal failure like arnold in charge is a nonsense especially when he and other ex players have self interest at heart
6651050 its a myth so why would you tell a nathan byrnes or a bruce djite that thank god neither listened and instead got themselves decent deals in greece and turkey
6651051 players performances are sometimes as good as the team selections of the coach if he screws up then the team is unbalanced and players can be make to look far less good than what they are but you have to say they were very disappointing some of them seemed to go backwards
6651052 the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
6651053 will review the fact and the circumstances surrounding the case along with the medical evidence to determine if additional charges are appropriate
6651054 its really nice especially after youve come from summerville high school of 3 400 students and all of a sudden youre down to 850 its utopia
6651055 were full tilt everythings ready absolutely everythings ready everythings working now dont jinx me everything is working at this moment
6651056 to be able to come here and see the halls not so packed as they are at summerville and fort dorchester says that we did the right thing that we certainly needed another high school badly
6651057 enjoy these numbers now because in just a matter of two years from now this place will be packed like the rest of them because they keep coming
6651058 we would love to be able to have classes not packed to the gills
6651059 none of us is as good as all of us

6651067 it is easier to control the poor than control the happily wealthy
6651068 mind is creative and conditions environment and all experiences in life are the result of our habitual or predominant mental attitude
6651069 the attitude of mind necessarily depends upon what we think therefore the secret of all power all achievement and all possession depends upon our mode of thought
6651070 there is a world within a world of thought and feeling and power of light and life and beauty and although invisible its forces are mighty
6651071 the world within is governed by mind when we discover this world we shall find the solution for every problem the cause for every effect and since the world within is subject to our control all laws of power and possession are also within our control
6651072 every thought therefore is a cause and every condition an effect for this reason it is absolutely essential that you control your thoughts so as to bring forth only desirable conditions
6651073 you cant have a universe without mind entering into it the mind is actually shaping the very thing that is being perceived
6651074 there is no virtue in poverty no beauty in self denial

6651132 hes not there yet as compared with where he was when he was with us early in the year but thats to be expected because he hasnt been out there that many times he just looked crisp to me
6651133 he was throwing pitches on both sides of the plate for strikes
6651134 he was very confident with his pitches threw a lot of pitches for strikes and came right after the hitters
6651135 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6651136 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6651137 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6651138 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6651139 the army and police arrested a suspected bomber not far away from scene of the attack
6651140 they also recovered a suicide jacket from a nearby mosque and seized explosives
6651141 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6651142 we shut the factory for a day to mourn this tragedy in which 67 people died
6651143 the army has killed hundreds of innocent people and we attacked it to teach it a lesson
6651144 even if you have to sit together for a week
6651145 the threat that we are facing today has no precedent
6651146 our enemy lurks silently within our society this is our war

6651148 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6651149 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6651150 bsp winning seats in municipal elections last year has not affected our strength they have not won any seats reserved for dalits they won some seats in the mcd because we were a little weak then
6651151 i see no threat from bsp and we are not disturbed by their rise they will not be able to pose any threat to our traditional vote bank
6651152 this is not going to help bsp i am confident that we will emerge victorious for the third consecutive term in the polls
6651153 it does not mean that bsp is powerful the fact was that congress was weak at that time now our party has strengthened itself
6651154 dont you have a class now are you working how old are you where did you study
6651155 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective

6651159 chris understood that his continuing presence in the office would be a distraction
6651160 i did not reach this decision lightly chris has been a loyal and effective city employee for many years he deserves the presumption of innocence unless and until the courts find otherwise
6651161 should chris be exonerated of all charges i would welcome him back as chief of staff and do whatever is necessary to see that he receives full back pay
6651162 with sadness i announce that i have requested a leave of absence from my duties as chief of staff for councilman jack kelly i have taken this action because it is in the councilmans best interest and the best interests of the citizens of philadelphia i have requested that my leave begin immediately and extend until after the trial of the charges against me

6651193 i have great concerns about petitioners habitual consumption of prescription painkillers ambien sleeping pills and rum or vodka each night and during the day
6651194 when i have expressed my grave concern to petitioner about her combining ambien with alcohol she flew into a rage and attempted to justify her addiction by claiming she has debilitating migraines and shoulder pain
6651195 i have observed petitioner wake up on many mornings in a stupor from her nightly cocktail
6651196 petitioner is in no condition to drive in the morning i have seen petitioner be drowsy and dizzy with difficulties in coordination
6651197 i have warned petitioner on numerous occasions to refrain from transporting our children in the car when she is in such a state
6651198 petitioner has confessed to me that she has memory blackouts
6651199 petitioner has rarely been alone with our children and when she is alone with them she is constantly checking her blackberry
6651200 petitioner has never been without the help of her nannies she cannot tolerate the presence of all three children at once
6651201 she does not know how to handle them and is easily irritated and annoyed by them
6651202 its a fantastic co star to have in the film but also a strong opponent
6651203 but hopefully its been a bigger co star than opponent and i think it will be in the end
6651204 when we did bond i wasnt in the exotic locations everyone went to the bahamas except me
6651205 this is a little less warm and there are a couple more insects but to me this is very exotic
6651206 but the midges are a nightmare its been like this all the time weve been shooting
6651207 scots are great fun its very natural for us to work here and the people are very similar so its very easy for us to get on have a pint and get the craic
6651208 i think we have the same way of talking and share the same sense of irony and sarcasm nothing would stop me coming back here to make another film this has been a fantastic experience
6651209 to be honest i hadnt seen any bond films before i did that one
6651210 ive seen them all now because i have a box set but i did not have a great relationship to bond at all and i didnt go back and see the other movies before making casino royale
6651211 the reception the film got was well deserved it was about time to move bond into the new millennium
6651212 there is nothing wrong with the other ones they were perfect for their time but this script was fairly radical for a lot of people and we had to catch up
6651213 im very proud to have been a part of it
6651214 daniel craig was excellent he is a fantastic actor and a great guy to work with
6651215 we were a very tight unit making bond and i didnt think about the size of it that much when i did it
6651216 but the aftermath was bigger than making it with all the premieres and interviews im definitely looking forward to seeing the new one
6651217 i was offered quite afew villain roles after bond and a surprising number of dramas in europe and the us so it opened up the market a bit more for me i sometimes get recognised from that if i sit still long enough but i now have long hair and a beard
6651218 its great to bring a project of this calibre to scotland
6651219 in years gone by major films such as braveheart went elsewhere to find the facilities they required
6651220 so its incredibly satisfying to convince a major european director that not only can scotland work as scotland but can pass for a whole other continent too
6651221 we started out together so its very natural for us and nice to do something again but this is very different from the kind of things weve done before
6651222 i have filmed in scotland before and there is a good cast here
6651223 martin has been fantastic to work with he is a natural talent and is one in a million
6651224 he has the talent to do whatever he wants in acting there are no limits and its now up to him what he does
6651225 its a big big honour to play with those guys
6651226 they have a team that does charity games with celebrities
6651227 the last time i played was last year but they get quite a crowd and its awesome
6651228 i see brian a lot i play cards with him and his wife and hes still top of his game on the pitch
6651229 i know he was very famous here i missed him when he played a pre season friendly for clyde against rangers
6651230 but hes still in very good shape and i think they would love to get him back

6651233 i thought about what i could do in three minutes that would capture the essence of all of these ships and i decided to use a list or a parade of ships which is something that is often done in these harbors so i thought i would try to do that musically

6651241 these actions would ensure that low power auxiliary operations do not cause harmful interference to new public safety and commercial wireless services in the band

6651243 it didnt matter if it was the olympics the world championships the feeling is the same i was very cool and concentrated

6651247 while hillcrest labs has a great deal of respect for nintendo and the wii hillcrest labs believes that nintendo is in clear violation of its patents and has taken this action to protect its intellectual property rights
6651248 we have not been served with any lawsuit or other action by hillcrest and therefore have no comment
6651249 it could happen but the stakes would be so high that nintendo wouldnt let it happen
6651250 the reality of it is one of two things is going to happen either theres no merit to hillcrests suit and theyll lose or nintendo will settle
6651251 you can describe multiple products in your patent application and the fact that you dont describe the exact same product thats not the key

6651262 its time for the state to step up and properly fund education and not allow the divisiveness weve had among our school districts to continue where we take money from some and give it to others

6651410 the removable shock absorbing rubber paws fit over the metal tips for use on hard surfaces such as asphalt and pavements the paws effectively absorbs the poles impact when walking on hard surfaces it is also recommended that you use the rubber paws on the end of the poles so there is no danger of damage to the lawn and pathways a hard bodied paw is not very good for nordic walking in which more elastic paws are preferred
6651411 i found out that naturally i am walking with poles when they are not
6651412 now if i will replace between the left hand pole and the right hand pole the paws will each day be worn on a different side this will equalize the wear and give a longer life to your walking poles paws how will i know which pole was yesterday in my left hand and in the right hand of course by the different colors of the poles another good reason not use nordic walking poles with special left and right gloves

6651423 work has commenced on building a brewery in the yarra valley an hour from the centre of melbourne
6651424 the minister has asked his department to explore the provenance of these objects and potential avenues for their acquisition
6651425 prime minister kevin rudd should use his relationship with british prime minister gordon brown to convince the uk government to purchase the boomerang and donate it to australia in a gesture of friendship and to mark our shared heritage
6651426 the boomerang should be returned to kurnell as a symbol of that first meeting and so all australians have the opportunity to see it
6651427 having the boomerang back in kurnell will be an historic symbol of harmony between our two cultures and will help teach young australians about the importance of aboriginal culture
6651428 the army and police arrested a suspected bomber not far away from scene of the attack
6651429 they also recovered a suicide jacket from a nearby mosque and seized explosives
6651430 the army has killed hundreds of innocent people and we attacked it to teach it a lesson
6651431 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6651432 even if you have to sit together for a week
6651433 the threat that we are facing today has no precedent
6651434 our enemy lurks silently within our society this is our war
6651435 given the lack of statistical significance in the black youth unemployment rates the department of labor does not disseminate those rates we dont publish statistically insignificant results only significant results
6651436 really we are just going to back ourselves to play and whichever defenders on him just back him in to do the best job they can
6651437 we will have no emphasis on keeping it off him specifically or trying to change hawthorn in the way they want to play
6651438 if he kicks his 100th goal and were 18 goals to six up i think our boys wont be too fussed
6651439 id expect glassy will pick him up at the start
6651440 it was a sad moment but it went quietly to sleep
6651441 he felt really lonely and he wanted to be with his mother and family
6651442 it was suffering extremely so weve had to make the very difficult decision
6651443 wed love to be a lot more consistent theres no doubt about that
6651444 but i think if we had the answer as to why we wouldve done it already and wed be a lot higher up on the table
6651445 i think were renowned for the fact were going to try some things and things arent going to for us all that time
6651446 we just need to have the strength of mind to know to keep going and to keep building away
6651447 i think in the past weve made the mistake when things go against us we tend to try and play catch up footy and touch football rather than building the pressure and building a game again
6651448 its something we need to learn from and there s no bigger test than this week
6651449 its going to be a really tough test for us and well be able to see where were at and if were any chance of making this top eight
6651450 well its modelling and the government will be doing its own modelling
6651451 thats the whole point of having a green paper going through this process talking to the community not only the business community but households as well
6651452 theyre suggesting there are a large number of jobs on the line
6651453 at the end of the day weve got to understand there is not a bottomless pit of money here
6651454 unfortunately some of the big polluting industries and corporations dont want to take responsibility for reducing their emissions and are seeking exemptions from the carbon pollution reduction scheme
6651455 it is a selfish and short sighted approach on their part
6651456 were concerned that there is no responsible business voice out there
6651457 weve seen a lot of special pleading from business but weve seen no plan about how they want to be here in 20 years time with a low carbon output
6651458 some of the businesses have genuine trade exposure and they will get assistance
6651459 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6651460 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6651461 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to ensure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6651462 freedom of speech for every person and every idea is one of the bedrock principles on which america was founded
6651463 censorship reflects a deep lack of faith in the american system and it teaches students exactly the wrong lesson on what america is about
6651464 we are thrilled that the court in this case made the importance of students first amendment rights so completely clear
6651465 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6651466 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes

6651469 sadly it seems that certain roman officials in poland are not aware of the position or policies of their own church
6651470 yes we understand that religious zealots and fanatical politicians will seek to deny the validity of this church by frightening the faithful about our unconditional acceptance of people who are gay bisexual transgendered divorced remarried questioning or any other artificial and irrelevant barrier or label used by the church to separate people from god
6651471 unlike some traditional churches we welcome all people to the table of the lord saint and sinner alike with no judgment so that they may equally share in the most holy sacraments of the church
6651472 most importantly we welcome and embrace those people whom the church has harmed through a regular and intentional pattern of ignorance prejudice discrimination or worse yet indifference
6651473 a true church is a place where the spirit of god fills the hearts of the people and inspires them on to great works of mercy charity and love
6651474 like many other communities of faith the reformed catholic church is seeking to be the living hands and feet of our lord

6651482 when every single member country of the nsg has signed the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ctbt why should india get a free pass
6651483 pakistan has warned that carving out a huge exemption for india increases the risk of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent why should we allow india to vastly increase its nuclear weapons programme
6651484 as the end of his term nears president bush seeks to grant india a proliferation pardon excusing its past violations of arms control norms
6651485 the us today delivered to the nsg a draft rule change for india that undermines the entire international framework to limit spread of nuclear weapons bushs proposal contains no nonproliferation controls whatsoever
6651486 nuri will be rather close to hong kong this afternoon and tonight with a chance of a direct hit
6651487 soo the us track and field team just laid a big fat egg over at the birds nest
6651488 there was nothing whatsoever to suggest he would do something like this
6651489 whatever the outcome i will never believe he intended to take his own life it was a tragic accident
6651490 as far as we can tell these two tragic events were not connected
6651491 whatever the background we send our warmest sympathy to everyone who knew them
6651492 all young people have a right to stay safe be healthy and be informed about managing successful relationships and making a positive contribution to society
6651493 young queers in cornwall regularly tell our helpline that their local school or their mates can be very hostile or just horribly ignorant about these things
6651494 they say its very difficult to get access to sensible useful information or to find out about where they can turn for information and help when they need it
6651495 schools and other mainstream agencies need to get the relevant information out there for their lgbt service users and make skilled support available
6651496 above all they need to challenge the stigmas and the silly myths around the perfectly normal fact that some people in cornwall do naturally grow up gay lesbian or bisexual and have a right to be respected on a level of absolute equality with their peers
6651497 waiting in vain is kind of about temptation and redemption and the varying ways you can view these things
6651498 i hope when you find what youre looking for youre not too blind to see it
6651499 now if we set this apple down it would become spoiled within a few days but if we take a bite of it like this it becomes part of us forever and we can take it with us
6651500 if you love something set it free and if comes back to you it was meant to be and if it doesnt then it wasnt yours to begin with
6651501 they are senior advocates and did not tender either conditional or unconditional apology for their conduct in the bmw case
6651502 they have forfeited their right to enjoy the honour conferred on them by this court of being designated as senior advocates
6651503 usurping the powers of the bar council of delhi in imposing a ban on the two senior lawyers for four months from practising in the high court and all other subordinate courts and tribunals coming under the supervisory powers of the high court
6651504 at least you still have the journey concert to look forward to
6651505 i saw my ex boyfriend the other day while pumping gas and my heart jumped right down to my throat
6651506 the social stigma of the child being born outside marriage
6651507 officials will work very closely with federal and state agencies to investigate these claims
6651508 it was like we got hit with a baseball bat
6651509 unfortunately that end of the house was already well alight
6651510 the flames were so intense they burnt trees around the property the entire home was fully involved very quickly and totally destroyed
6651511 we have a couple of theories as to how the blaze started but we wont speculate at this stage
6651512 the arson squad is investigating but there dont appear to be any suspicious circumstances
6651513 we still encourage people to come out and enjoy local food
6651514 the base on both sides is locked in and i think will come home to them
6651515 this will really be determined by the independents who really arent paying too much attention right now
6651516 that county each cycle is becoming more and more purple
6651517 when i started polling nevada that was a pretty solidly conservative county the fact that it is tied now means it is a true swing county
6651518 i think the independents will decide the race as they often do
6651519 the washoe numbers need to improve for senator mccain but theres plenty of time for that to take place
6651520 obama has not proven to have benefited from those registration gains
6651521 one is hes getting his policy message out and two we had a tough tough tough primary and we are putting back together the democratic coalition
6651522 right now no one ive talked to in the obama campaign has any concerns with any of the polling
6651523 we expect nevada to be very close and we expect it to be competitive
6651524 well be continuing our outreach to women and hispanics those two constituencies are important and well campaign very heavily with them
6651525 from the moment this began we told them that this was the wrong person he was not there the evening of the event
6651526 we are delighted that indians are making their mark in various disciplines in the ongoing olympics
6651527 sportsmen like sushil kumar and abhinav bindra olympics gold medal winner for air rifle shooting have paved the path for more success to follow
6651528 advani powered by other hindu extremists in the sangh parivar wants to be the next prime minister of india and he is exploiting the situation to come to power by giving a communal tone to the amarnath land row
6651529 has been going on for more than a century and a half
6651530 why do we suddenly need land transfer in the name of the shrine board
6651531 is a muslim legacy and shouldnt have been tampered with
6651532 was being used to enable hindu pilgrims camp and muslims would dutifully offer their services for the peaceful conclusion of the pilgrimage
6651533 new delhi is adamant to overlook the writing on the wall kashmiris are fighting for their rights and their identity
6651534 from a conflict paradigm not just through the prism of statecraft
6651535 i had warned india and pakistan that the anger in kashmiris has not died it was hidden there and now it has erupted like a volcano
6651536 mistook the silence in kashmir as a return of peace
6651537 india and pakistan sooner or later will have to talk to the kashmiris and solve the dispute our aspirations have to be taken into consideration
6651538 my client is willing to sit alone with mukesh at whatever time and place he suggests
6651539 we are willing to let the brothers sit with any expert or their mother to resolve the issue
6651540 i appear for ril and mukesh ambani is not a party to the court proceedings i will have to take instructions
6651541 why dont you go back to your mother both parties should settle its not a family dispute its a matter of national importance and a resolution will be in the public interest since natural gas is a national asset
6651542 clearly it failed in its intent to amuse and that is why we took the decision to withdraw it
6651543 heinz is off to a strong start in the fiscal year with excellent growth in first quarter sales
6651544 we achieved record organic sales growth reflecting the strength of our top 15 brands dynamic growth in our emerging markets higher marketing investments and benefits from increased focus on products for healthier lifestyles
6651545 and most recognise other states cps but civil partners do not necessarily get the treatment that they would in their country of origin
6651546 for example in france people with uk cps are not recognised as their partners next of kin in terms of tax
6651547 i raised this issue with the french justice minister rachida dati in june on a personal level i have also written to her about it
6651548 additionally i have drafted a written declaration with the participation of the international lesbian and gay association ilga europe which will formally raise the matter in the european parliament
6651549 member states with existing same sex partnership legislation to recognise the arrangements of other member states that have also made provisions for same sex partnerships
6651550 calls upon the commission to draw up guidelines for such mutual recognition by member states with existing same sex partnership legislation
6651551 the declaration will be launched in the next few weeks
6651552 and we are hoping for organisations to join the campaign and put pressure on meps to sign up
6651553 we are optimistic because lots of declarations do move on in policy terms
6651554 we aim to have the french do something about this issue this year as this is the year of their presidency
6651555 we are also planning to gain some cross party support and support from meps from other eu states to obtain the best results
6651556 our british civil partnerhsip is not recognised in france at all and we have no legal rights as a couple over in france
6651557 we thought the solution would be to have a pacs over here but we were refused from doing this because we were already in a cp in the u k
6651558 the registrar in france required the british embassy to issue a certificate de coutume to say that we are not in a legal civil partnership in the u k obviously we are
6651559 it seems that the tribunal recognises our civil partnership but not the french tax authorities or the french legal system
6651560 it seems really discriminating to british nationals since the french have a same sex partnership called the pacs and they also give gay dutch married couples full legal recognition
6651561 couples with a pac have 0 inheritance tax whilst we are still subject to 60 inheritance tax
6651562 obviously this would be a huge bill for us and would mean that we would have to sell our home to pay the tax bill
6651563 even life insurance would be subject to 60 taxes and because of the laws of succession it is almost impossible to leave it to your partner
6651564 a french couple with a pac living in the u k has always been able to benefit from the uk system in the same way as married or civil partners can and have no difficulty in leaving their estate to their partners and pay 0 inheritance tax
6651565 they also benefit from all other legal aspects of a british civil partnership
6651566 this is grossly unfair why should british gay couples be treated so badly in france when the uk give all the same benefits to french gay couples that they do to their own nationals
6651567 what is also unfair is that for french nationals living in the uk who already have a cp with their british partner and who now want a pac with their british partner presumably to safeguard their assets in france are allowed to do this
6651568 youre talking about a gangland style execution because he was gay

6651573 i have tried to assure him that trinamool congress have assured us that there will be no lawlessness during the aug 24 demonstration at the tata motors factory site in singur
6651574 i hope all the parties even those in the opposition should think before taking any action so that these kinds of projects in west bengal can go through peacefully
6651575 they have invested for this project they dont want to pull out until and unless they are forced to do so
6651576 we had to go in twice because of the lightning and rain but came out refocused both times and were able to get some stuff done

6651583 should the potential miss south africa participant have a south african female identity document it means that the state considers her to be a woman
6651584 in south africa it would be very clearly illegal to discriminate against such a woman who has transitioned from male
6651585 it would be nice to see the pageant do the right thing though it could be a wonderful learning experience for all involved
6651586 were delighted to celebrate all those people both gay and gay friendly whove made an inspirational contribution to equality in britain today

6651761 she has umpteen houses so i dont know how she can say this if she hasnt got a flat then where does she stay
6651762 if it were true then most muslims would be living on the streets which is not the case
6651763 there is no problem for muslims renting or buying houses here whether they are film stars or working class
6651764 it is the case that in certain communities you have to respect the culture such as jains who would not allow a non vegetarian to stay in the association and one has to respect that however giving it a communal colour is what we object to

6651812 we have to remember those who died the tragic death from georgian aggression
6651813 there are cases of putting on fire houses by the georgian special command
6651814 that is their word as you know georgians are very good at provocations
6651815 the georgians or anyone who would do this are not human
6651816 i only have one favor to ask everyone who comes here
6651817 do not leave even one georgian kitten living among us because the day after it will become a tiger
6651818 after they blew everything up they shouted come out and raise your hands and we wont hurt you
6651819 this is for the heroes killed on their own land by the bloody aggressors
6651820 our battle for independence comes to its logical end before we thought we might have peaceful negotiation with the regime of georgia after august 8 it was clear this was impossible

6651823 a bride who was good in studies adds to family prestige but if women work who will look after the household they should make use of their education to teach their children instead after all the husband who is working cant be expected to help with the childrens homework
6651824 when i married my wife there was a considerable difference in the level of education between us however this was not based on ability to learn but on her opportunity for education our marriage rests on a mutual understanding of more basic human qualities i was able to let her go to college which she did with considerable success this does not mean there are no problems her field is very different from mine so we have very little in common professionally to talk about which i do miss and i guess she does as well it is important to have that common basis of human quality and values that underlie everything else
6651825 sunil not so educated married to sushma highly educated were having a difficult time because sunil was insecure that sushma would be the dominant partner consequently he started aggressively finding fault with her cooking to make his wife feel low i worked with sunil to make him secure with whatever education he had once he felt secure he got over his insecurity and stopped finding faults with her
6651826 the only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn and change
6651827 one is health problems living so close to the site i have a concern about that
6651828 i dont expect somebody who lives on the battery or daniel island to understand what im asking for

6651835 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6651836 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
6651837 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
6651838 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
6651839 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
6651840 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
6651841 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
6651842 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
6651843 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
6651844 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
6651845 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

6651867 as a result of this crime a young man has lost his life many other lives have been devastated and the borough of shenandoah has been filled with tensions between many ethnic groups

6651922 a relic of the cold war of the age of ideology
6651923 with the splitting and eclipse of christianity man began to worship a new deity the nation the nation became a mystical object claiming mans love and loyalty the nation state along with the doctrine of national sovereignty fragmented humanity it could not provide a rational framework within which the relations between nations could develop

6651926 although stalinism may have been a needless tragedy for both the russian people and communism as an ideal there is the intellectually tantalizing possibility that for the world at large it was a blessing in disguise

6651938 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6651939 i shall dream of a world where crapatacularone is more than just a human search engine or a free online spell checker
6651940 it was a sad moment but it went quietly to sleep

6651942 it was suffering extremely so weve had to make the very difficult decision
6651943 true facts and humorous stories about lima and allen county
6651944 it was a lot different a lot of changes have taken place
6651945 my dad took me to a tractor pull when i was 9 years old at least thats the first time i remember and ive been going ever since
6651946 im really into the tractors and i like rooting for the john deere
6651947 its unbelievable the horsepower they get out of them you follow a tractor down the road and you know how slow they are

6651955 or else confused customers will simply bail out and not complete their purchase
6651956 dont forget that online casinos affiliate programs are a great way to drive customers towards your site
6651957 you may have to pay up to 25 for an affiliate lead but in the long run youre making a hell of a lot more money than you would without affiliate traffic youll find that the top 20 of your affiliates count for nearly 80 of all your income so be sure to take care of your business partners
6651958 fancy drop down menus and fast moving flash graphics are great for catching the users eye but when you want to get down to business make sure your site presents an easy navigation menu and map this will allow most online casinos users to get what they are after and at the same time be wowed by your graphical presentations
6651959 and the old adage you have to spend money to make money applies dont go cheap on your websites checkout process or navigational menus instead save money by using simple content generation software and ready made blog software these steps will ensure quality at the right price
6651960 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
6651961 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay on for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
6651962 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible

6651982 i pick a location and i photograph that location and then i try to figure out what the actual presence means in terms of spirits or ghosts
6651983 usually the places that i pick are places of either great spiritual presence or really intense almost horror like some act of genocide happened there i need to come to terms with that to understand it better and the only way i can do that is by approaching it and then incorporating it into my work
6651984 a family pet dies a farm animal dies and its not clear why
6651985 closer to trying to understand what death means what war means
6651986 i allow myself access to physical and emotional spaces that i otherwise wouldnt have i need to be in those spaces physically in order to understand them and to do what i want to do
6651987 being in an environment that you create yourself from a kind of artistic perspective allows you to hear messages from whats around you from the objects images and ideas you choose to surround yourself with
6651988 even if you are not looking for them thats the most extraordinary thing once you have tuned into something no matter where you go you see things you know
6651989 the perception held by a lot of young people is that a career in technology means a career as a programmer
6651990 we intend to dispel this myth by introducing them to all kinds of interesting people in all areas of the industry and also showing them the cool technology they could be working with
6651991 we also hope to show their teachers who will attend all the sessions the types of cool technology they could be teaching in schools and how easy it is to use
6651992 this is a worrying trend and is causing concern not for only microsoft but all technology companies in ireland and throughout the western world where uptake on technology courses is steadily declining
6651993 there may be any number of reasons for this but were hopeful digiteenz will help play a part in reversing this trend by educating and inspiring teenagers while breaking down the stereotypes typically associated with careers in technology
6651994 like a lot of students finishing second level i was completely confused about the next step i should take all i was certain of was that i had a passion for technology
6651995 this suited perfectly as they were able to place me into a role that combined the two
6651996 the troughton era presented many a feminist role in the supporting cast yet the companions of the time were some of the most notable screamers in the series history
6651997 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6651998 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6651999 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6652000 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6652001 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6652002 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6652003 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement
6652004 a team of policemen in mufti came to the college campus on thursday and went through the records of some former and current medical students

6652019 her enthusiasm for just about anything life has to offer is undimmed
6652020 she couldnt cope anymore any conversation i had with her was about how she wanted to take care of her kids and she probably felt she couldnt do that anymore
6652021 she was so concerned about her daughters what would happen to them who would take care of them i know this sounds paradoxical but she felt that her daughters were suffering because she was failing to provide for them
6652022 we are all so upset because it happened to one of ours its a very tragic thing
6652023 i dont know what would prompt a mother to do that to her own children

6652039 informed sources tell us that top level officials in the mccain campaign have been calling certain state party chairmen to find out what they think the reaction of republican voters would be in the event that john mccain chooses a pro abortion choice running mate
6652040 why would they do that unless mccain is seriously considering someone like pennsylvanias tom ridge or even a liberal democrat like joe lieberman
6652041 will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies thats my commitment
6652042 he has made that commitment the expectation on the part of many pro life and pro family conservatives is that john mccain if elected president would nominate pro life judges to the federal courts and the supreme court would be totally dashed if he chooses a running mate who is not pro life
6652043 it is our position that a vp nominee who is not pro life is unacceptable it would be a slap in the face to the base of the party and would most likely cost mccain and the republican party the election

6652065 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6652066 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6652067 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6652068 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
6652069 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
6652070 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6652071 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6652072 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
6652073 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
6652074 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
6652075 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
6652076 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
6652077 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that

6652086 initially scanning electron microscopy sem conducted at another laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude that the spores were a weaponized form says kotula
6652087 the possible misinterpretation of the sem results arose because microanalysis in the sem is not a surface sensitive tool
6652088 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
6652089 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized
6652090 were trying to force feed austin and see where he is at mentally
6652091 it is good to see the indians make a bold statement by winning the second one day internationals at dambulla because a defeat there would have certainly left the tourists gasping and it would have been a near impossible task for them to comeback into the series
6652092 mendis is no doubt a very good bowler and has impressed everyone as an intelligent bowler but having said that the best way to tame him would be to have a positive mind set like s badrinath and the skipper himself mahendra singh dhoni showed with a match winning partnership
6652093 the problem with the indian batsmen at the moment seems to be they are too tensed up while playing the sri lankan spinners and it is quite understandable when the opposition has a bowler of murali s muttiah muralitharan stature
6652094 if they can go out and play both murali and mendis freely like they have been playing some of the other top spinners in the world then they will surely produce better results
6652095 gambhir and virender sehwag were in very good form during the test series and it is unfortunate that sehwag who handled both murali and mendis very well had to pull out of the odi series while gambhir had to sit out at dambulla it is a huge set back when two of your in form batsmen are injured but then that is cricket and one has to make use of the resources that is available

6652101 theyve done a really good job here and we can hold our heads high when you rank us up against the rest of the world
6652102 were well ahead of countries like canada and south africa and were up there with the likes of spain and holland
6652103 thats exciting for us and a great reflection of the work that people like the academy of sport and our whole high performance system do
6652104 we have limited money compared to a lot of countries and its what we extract out of that i like to think that it gives us confidence that our system works
6652105 we can do better we have to do better more in terms of the return we get for the amount of money we put in
6652106 the purpose of our job up here part of it is observing our athletes
6652107 weve seen them in an intense situation thats one element that helps us talk knowledgeably with sports when it gets down to the debrief process
6652108 a lot of countries are making comments about us and congratulating us i guess with an element of surprise that weve done so well for a small nation and that our conversion rate is so high

6652131 he is absolutely amazing hes our spiritual guide ive never met anyone who works so hard to spread buddhist teaching in the west and to help overcome everyday western problems his whole life is dedicated to helping other people
6652132 the inability of western students to assess the significance or proportionality of this issue or of any issue is closely linked to a tradition of extreme literalism that is fostered by some forms of protestant culture as for example among fundamentalist evangelicals these westerners in the nkt take their teacher literally as a buddha and apparently have absolute obedience to his beliefs so the particular problem here is that a tibetan ultra traditionalist has found a number of like minded westerners with a literalist view of religion almost certainly learnt from the protestant tradition
6652133 the transferring of this debate to the mass media has made the issue more extreme sensational confrontational and intractable
6652134 this protector of the doctrine is extremely important for holding tsongkhapas tradition without mixing and corrupting it with confusions due to the great violence and the speed of the force of his actions which fall like lightning to punish violently all those beings who have wronged the yellow hat tradition whether they are high or low this protector is also particularly significant with respect to the fact that many from our own side monks or lay people high or low are not content with tsongkhapas tradition which is like pure gold and have mixed and corrupted this tradition with the mistaken views and practices from other schools which are tenet systems that are reputed to be incredibly profound and amazingly fast but are in reality mistakes among mistakes faulty dangerous and misleading paths in regard to this situation this protector of the doctrine this witness manifests his own form or a variety of unbearable manifestations of terrifying and frightening wrathful and fierce appearances due to that a variety of events some of them having happened or happening some of which have been heard or seen seem to have taken place some people become unhinged and mad some have a heart attack and suddenly die some see through a variety of inauspicious signs their wealth accumulated possessions and descendants disappear without leaving any trace like a pond whose feeding river has ceased whereas some find it difficult to achieve anything in successive lifetimes
6652135 praise to you the protector of the yellow hat tradition you destroy like a pile of dust great adepts high officials and ordinary people who defile and corrupt the gelug order with this quotation from the praise to dorje shugden kyabje yongzin trijang dorje chang told me some highly interesting accounts which he had not written for publication as is clear from the above mentioned praise the protector has punished those who corrupted the gelug order the symptoms were clear with various episodes of punishments from the king entanglement with the law and untimely death for many powerful lama regents incarnate tulkus highly adept scholars high officials and rich and powerful people while being followers of lama tsongkhapa tradition they have corrupted it with other tenets and traditions since kyabje rinpoche told me about these with great compassion it is very precious for me with these accounts as the basis i compiled other reliable material and added to the ocean of praise to the protector

6652171 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve

6652173 we are here so that the world will know the truth
6652174 we have to remember those who died the tragic death from georgian aggression
6652175 there are cases of putting on fire houses by the georgian special command
6652176 that is their word as you know georgians are very good at provocations
6652177 the georgians or anyone who would do this are not human

6652179 do not leave even one georgian kitten living among us because the day after it will become a tiger

6652239 everything had a lounging listless madhouse air which was very painful the moping idiot cowering down with long dishevelled hair the gibbering maniac with his hideous laugh and pointed finger the vacant eye the fierce wild face the gloomy picking of the hands and lips and munching of the nails there they were all without disguise in naked ugliness and horror

6652393 knowledge in martial arts actually means self knowledge a martial artist has to take responsibility for himself and accept the consequences of his own doing the understanding of jeet kune do is through personal feeling from movement to movement in the mirror of the relationship and not through a process of isolation to be is to be related to isolate is death to me ultimately martial arts means honestly expressing yourself now it is very difficult to do it has always been very easy for me to put on a show and be cocky and be flooded with a cocky feeling and feel pretty cool and all that i can make all kinds of phoney things blinded by it or i can show some really fancy movement but to experience oneself honestly not lying to oneself and to express myself honestly now that is very hard to do

6652410 more than measuring quality the u s news theology and political thought converging at lipscomb in june this ranking is another sign of our increasing global engagement and leadership

6652424 i am convinced with all my heart that god almighty gave us this land and capacity to survive because we had elevated human life what a magnificent elevation and celebration of the human spirit

6652437 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6652438 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6652439 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6652440 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6652441 the idea is by tomorrow night all those forces will move to within that perimeter the peacekeeping perimeter
6652442 by the end of the 22nd we will pull back to the checkpoints line
6652443 some military commanders think it might take 10 days for that withdrawal to take place

6652449 many people have died because of russias use of cluster munitions in georgia even as moscow denied it had used this barbaric weapon

6652473 once we realized that with the prospect of another series going forward and sg 1 movies going forward this was the right way for the partnership between mgm and us and sci fi to go forward
6652474 if they werent in complete agreement on where to go next if it wasnt a joint decision there wouldnt be a movie deal already in place
6652475 the show was doing well but you dont wait until the show isnt doing well before you try to launch movies if you are going to go do movies when the show has still got life left in it thats a good time
6652476 riding one horse until its tired is not going to make it evolve into movies
6652477 and you know sg 1 owes atlantis a debt in that sense it helped revive the franchise for sg 1 and i think thats how its going to proceed between atlantis sg 1 and universe and the game thats going to help too
6652478 it will wear out when we stop making good shows that people want to see
6652479 and as long as we are putting our hearts and our effort into making the upcoming series and upcoming movie as good as they can be and as long as we still feel theyre vital i think its going to keep going strong
6652480 damn thats where i was headed but hes using ballads

6652489 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6652490 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6652491 if we apply the estimates of abuse to the over 74 000 disabled women in westchester the frightening result is that thousands and thousands of disabled women could be trapped in an abusive situation
6652492 i know from experience that people with disabilities accept all kinds of hardships in their daily lives
6652493 but domestic abuse is not a hardship its a crime that needs to be stopped

6652508 our guys did not find any powder there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample
6652509 the time has come now is the time to act on the word because in this place right now is the holy spirit who garnished the whole world
6652510 you will carry the anointing with you when you go back
6652511 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out
6652512 there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample
6652513 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6652514 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6652515 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6652516 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6652517 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6652518 this is the first day we can actually see the tops of the roads
6652519 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6652520 i still think we all need to stay on our toes

6652525 i said what the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6652526 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6652527 this storm is going to be with us for a while
6652528 it needs to come and get gone so we can get back to what we were doing
6652529 im ready to get back to work this is insane itll drive you nuts being stuck like this
6652530 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6652531 a partner with me in strengthening this economy for the middle class and working families
6652532 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6652533 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6652534 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6652535 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6652536 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6652537 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6652538 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6652539 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6652540 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6652541 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6652542 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6652543 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6652544 i know for sure what jesus would not do would be to sweep into a community gather up large numbers of people separate them from one another and deport them to another country in my own mind in my own conscience thats crystal clear jesus would not do that
6652545 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive
6652546 we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection
6652547 would be better served by helping individuals to comply with the law or working to change those laws rather than asking not to enforce it
6652548 thats what you do you dont want to do that then dont become a law enforcement officer
6652549 i think its an interesting idea because from our reports a lot of these raids have really impacted families and individuals and really terrorized communities
6652550 it should be logical that some agents think that tactic is too harsh and might not want to participate
6652551 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6652552 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6652553 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6652554 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6652555 we dont know why the chinese government has blocked itunes but it seems the most logical explanation is that it is because of us
6652556 one side of my brain says it must be the other side is just incredulous that our simple non violent action could have caused this
6652557 we spread the word around the athletes before the games that we were offering it to them for free
6652558 certainly we did intend the downloads to be a subtle form of protest for the athletes as well as an act of solidarity for the tibetan people
6652559 itunes is just an innocent bystander the album is being sold in hundreds of other stores it would have been stranger if itunes had not taken our album then that would have been a major political issue
6652560 weve seen the situation but cant offer any more information
6652561 it is unbelievable in there everyone is totally crazy once they are out of their competitions god knows what it is going to be like this weekend it is like a world within a world
6652562 the swimmers finished earlier in the week and it was like there was an eruption
6652563 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6652564 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6652565 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6652566 i will proclaim your name to my brethren i will sing your praise
6652567 participants in last springs workshops praised everything from the camaraderie between participants and the instructor to the creation of a fertile evocative space in which to write

6652569 i told him last night you know joe i cant stand john mccain
6652570 all my close votes hes always with me whether its the budget or energy issues
6652571 no matter what it is hes always with us he just does not vote right on iraq why would i want to throw away a good vote
6652572 i have a good relationship with joe biden i have great respect for joe
6652573 he was driven into some of the positions hes in because the far left took him on in the primary ive done a lot to protect joe biden
6652574 you could take all 100 senators democrats and republicans and i think they would all agree that the most knowledgeable person on foreign affairs is joe biden
6652575 i know the press thinks theyve narrowed it down to kaine bayh and biden but i think there are other people in the running and i think we could be surprised
6652576 i really dont know whos going to be the vice president
6652577 i have talked to obama on quite a few occasions mostly telling him who i didnt want
6652578 we the undersigned urge you to declare a moratorium on immigration raids in the state of rhode island until our nation can implement a comprehensive and just reform of our immigration laws
6652579 it is our hope that such reform will make immigration raids obsolete
6652580 i wanted to tell the story of the women around muhammad and to honor them and him as well
6652581 what i see as the islam muhammad envisioned has in crucial ways been changed i wanted to show people especially in the west about early islam
6652582 you can press on keep running he is real he is beautiful and he is worth it dont be afraid to let suffering have its way in your life that it may produce endurance character and a hope that will never disappoint you dont give up keep coming to the god whose love even the grave cannot contain keep running child for god is with you
6652583 so we do not have the strength we should have and jesus commandments become overwhelmingly burdensome to us in fact many christians cannot even believe he actually intended for us to carry them out so what is the result
6652584 christianity has not so much been tried and found wanting as it has been found difficult and left untried
6652585 the spirit of the disciplines is nothing but the love of jesus with its resolute will to be like him whom we love
6652586 you see i am not so bad there are things about me to enjoy
6652587 your demands are too severe i am not ready to experience you directly please keep your distance
6652588 yes i know and jesus is yahweh he created all things
6652589 yahweh created with jesus he was beside him as a master craftsmen but yahweh is jehovah
6652590 he is yahweh philippians 2 says that he has been given the name above every name and that at the name of jesus every knee will bow and every tongue confess that he is lord that he is yahweh
6652591 weve said from the beginning our bars and restaurants shouldnt be at a disadvantage with those across the river so we want to make sure we have a level playing field
6652592 this still provides the opportunity for our local hospitality community to have some economic activity associated with this event
6652593 i just figured its a once in a lifetime thing here for the town so lets see what happens
6652594 i dont want it to be something that we put on the shoulders of st paul taxpayers and i dont think its something we should use as a profit driver for the city
6652595 whats so hard for me to follow on this is that we have been working on this since june im not sure why people think the landscape is changing
6652596 my vote wasnt based on what the city of minneapolis was doing i dont want to create policy based on what other guys are doing
6652597 kita berharap mereka jadi mawas dirilah bahwa kecelakan itu dapat menimpa siapa saja

6652601 they can just come into the bank with 1 million make the deposit get one statement and they dont have to run around to different financial institutions
6652602 once these options have been explained usually customers feel more comfortable with what they have and that any additional types of insurance arent necessary
6652603 this painting was first inspired by a song that i heard one day i started to contemplate the awesome privilege that mary was given being able to hold god in her arms but also keeping in mind that he was still her baby this cute little child whom she bore was also god in the flesh and yet she cuddled and kissed him just as all mothers do with their babies this thought propelled me right into this painting which i wanted to be a very human representation of divinity my prayer is that the viewer will be struck as i am with the amazing way that god chose to send his son into this world in pure humility
6652604 is it ok that all i wanna do is be with you to gaze upon you to sing my songs of love and adoration straight to you cuz i really dont want any other job than that
6652605 i wish i had seven houses i want to elect this sucessful man to be president because he will help me afford seven houses too
6652606 i will stand with them muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
6652607 he just finished paying back his student loans so he cant be elitist
6652608 but obama said he wouldnt be mean he he said it i heard it
6652609 ask my wife she owns em all shes the one with the money too i have to work for my living just like any other american
6652610 sen mccain himself does not own any of the properties theyre all owned by cindy mccain her dependent children and the trusts and companies they control

6652632 he tried one card it failed then another it failed again after much faffing he sent an aide out to get cash
6652633 he apologised profusely and paid when his aide turned up with the money
6652634 no 2 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view
6652635 if you want it for art and decoration thats fine but for achieving any kind of power thats useful its not a very good idea and i dont know of anywhere thats done it very successfully
6652636 they can help just like biofuels can help just like tides can help in the end it is conservation that is the main thing you and i can do and that we can do in this city

6652686 theyre such a high level team that they force us to play better
6652687 were putting all of our emotion out there into these matches
6652688 i just have to sit on the bench and not worry too much when we are playing like that
6652689 this area is seeing historic levels of rain with totals in excess of 20 inches already
6652690 additional rainfall of eight to fifteen inches is possible through saturday
6652691 this storm is turning into a serious catastrophic flooding event particularly in southern brevard county
6652692 the weather forecast tells us that some areas could receive rainfall as much as 30 inches
6652693 we have removed alligators we have removed snakes and weve removed all kinds of wildlife
6652694 our animal services and enforcement officers have been doing this all over the county for the last three days
6652695 if it doesnt come out to the open water that is actually better for everyone as long as we can shut the rain off in southern brevard county
6652696 we have talked about it being an agonizing run through florida
6652697 the agonizing run is on it is only drifting north at 3 mph basically it has come undone
6652698 it has stayed over land longer than anticipated and it has weakened quite a bit and that is great news
6652699 even though flooding looks nasty it is great news that it is not getting stronger
6652700 i saw the swirling and stuff and there was a lot of debris and everything
6652701 as quick as it came in it looked like it went right back up it looks like part of a house or part of a roof and a couple of carports and a lot of aluminum and insulation and construction barricades from mico road

6652703 i had no idea what it looked like out there until today
6652704 it pretty much came up to my ears and chin
6652705 i saw this little kid coming toward me so i grabbed him and swam him back to the shore line and went back for the other two guys
6652706 theyre probably areas of the state that found the rains very beneficial

6652715 coach rick neuheisel himself gave me a tour of the campus and showed me around its a beautiful campus and i love the area coach neuheisel is great when i first met him i felt like i had known him for a while hes easy to talk to and i like how serious he is about getting things going there
6652716 i lived there for about six years and i grew up following them
6652717 i liked watching them play and they have a solid defense i liked how they used shawn merriman and they talked about using me that way
6652718 coach rick neuheisel himself gave me a tour of the campus and showed me around its a beautiful campus and i love the area
6652719 they have a good engineering program and the engineering department is conveniently located next to the practice field
6652720 when i first met him i felt like i had known him for a while hes easy to talk to and i like how serious he is about getting things going there
6652721 i think within the next few years ucla will be real good and will be able to challenge usc
6652722 with offensive coordinator coach norm chow there too that definitely gives ucla a better chance to compete against usc
6652723 i normally watch college football any way but this year its gonna be different
6652724 ill be watching these teams and thinking about where i want to go
6652725 i really want to see how ucla does because i think they can have a pretty good year even with some of their injury issues
6652726 i went to usc for the spring game and it was awesome
6652727 the players are so good and it really showed me the level they are at and how hard they worked it was eye opening
6652728 but at ucla all the different coaches are involved and coach neuheisel is very involved and sends me personal notes too theyve made me feel like they really want me
6652729 they have great tradition and a great defense they are also recruiting me real hard and i could tell the coaches are sincere and want to go there and see what its like
6652730 theyve been after me hard and i wanted to show them the same respect and decided to take a visit there
6652731 i like colorado because they have great coaches and they are still a young team
6652732 it was just awesome when i got back from michigan i really thought that maybe they were number one and even above ucla but i was just acting in the moment and decided to take time and let everything settle down
6652733 coach rich rodriguez told me about all the renovations they are making to the stadium and facilities its going to be even better
6652734 i want to take all five of my visits and probably wont decide until late december
6652735 hopefully the trips will open my eyes even more and ill be able to find what im looking for i want more than a good football program i want to feel at home and be happy where im living
6652736 thats my number one thing i shoot the gaps well and do stunts well i have a great pass rush and a good move off the edge i love getting after the quarterback on third and long
6652737 but i still want to improve my moves and not rely on my speed so much
6652738 i think he would do for senator obama what lyndon johnson did for john kennedy hes got serious foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time
6652739 not something that lends itself to on the job training
6652740 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
6652741 i made it clear to him and everybody else i never worked for anybody in my life
6652742 i got here when i was 29 i never had a boss i dont know how id handle it
6652743 all bets off 15 percent respecting couples incoming the u
6652744 theres unquestionably the uk well being business lamb a half starved incise on horseback assisted incipiency in any event the natural collision is that kind of plentiful cases re uncreativeness thunder mug continue helped effortlessly back super trim and savoring

6652747 auto refresh features on web sites i e when a web site page reloads automatically does not increase the number of sessions
6652748 if we are not willing to provide the troops necessary for victory however victory itself will be impossible
6652749 john recognized early on that more troops would be needed in order to achieve the security necessary for the iraqis to make the political progress were seeing now
6652750 he supported that action even though many said it would hurt his campaign for president he didnt care about popularity he cared about success for our troops and our country and now that the surge has worked it proves that johns judgment was correct
6652751 granted unprecedented access this year revealing vast landholdings including 3 493 acres in bangkok
6652752 as a group the worlds 15 richest royals have increased their total wealth to 131b up from 95b last year
6652753 the view in the room was decidedly hardline in sending a clear message to the interim fijian government with a clear distinction that when it comes to the people of fiji that the mood of this family of nations and democracies in the wider pacific region is that wed like them back as soon as possible
6652754 youre talking about massive youth unemployment in east timor of more than 50 per cent of young people
6652755 global economic factors are starting to affect australias car industry
6652756 we expect there to be a notable softening in new car sales for the rest of the year and were taking these actions to strategically position our business to match our production to market demand
6652757 what weve seen in recent times is that the price of the australian sedans has increased by about au8 500 as a result of currency movements whereas the tariff is worth about 600
6652758 its quite clear that there are much larger issues at stake here than the tariff
6652759 again unfortunately this is a koala thats been bashed to death and then after its death they removed its leg
6652760 there were 58 allegations relating to the security forces and joint command during the state of siege
6652761 most of those violations were involving ill treatment and beatings of citizens
6652762 some of them involved death threats in fact there were six death threats
6652763 i think there are two obstacles one is one of process and the other one of will
6652764 the one of process involves ensuring the proper mechanisms exist within the security forces to ensure that people are held accountable for violations
6652765 in the case of the pntl those mechanisms are in place on paper
6652766 maybe it is too early to judge but it has been a significant period of time already and we think it is legitimate to ask for those results and we have not yet seen those results
6652767 it would be easy to take the wrong road and it would also be relatively achievable and realistic to take the right road
6652768 the government is very careful as they are doing this as a restoration in light of their failure to lift the case in the supreme court
6652769 it is strange that this should be an object of judicial decision because it is premature
6652770 there was supposed to be a signing of memorandum of agreement last august 5 in kuala lumpur
6652771 that did not happen because it was overtaken by a temporary restraining order issued by our supreme court
6652772 la verdad no fue f cil me prepar para ser el mejor s pilotear aviones y desmantelar bombas at micas s bucear y hablar ruso

6652775 who would pretend to have cancer it seemed implausible it seemed too bad taste

6652787 as children grow we educate them from the waist up and then just the head with a focus on one side of it
6652788 education takes us into a future we know nothing about
6652789 dont open your mouth if all you can do is put your foot into it

6652795 the withdrawal needs to take place and needs to take place now
6652796 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6652797 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day
6652798 moving around in the city and looking and searching in different places
6652799 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6652800 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6652801 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6652802 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6652803 we anticipate staying as long as there is need and helping to set up the economy because its very important that the economy begins to take on its normal aspects but it depends on our ability to do full assessments throughout georgia
6652804 dont make fun of the geeks they may grow up to be your boss
6652805 in addition to gauging a phrases appearance on a web page as other engines did it assessed relevance by counting the number and importance of other pages that linked to that page
6652806 i have been enormously impressed with the business and market position that larry and sergey have established with google and i am thrilled by the opportunity to work alongside them as we advance google to its next phase of growth
6652807 in the short time that eric has chaired our board of directors he has provided decisive leadership and has demonstrated a deep understanding of our technology and business
6652808 we feel extremely fortunate to have someone of erics stature leading our management team
6652809 we dont have as many managers as we should but we would rather have too few than too many
6652810 the downside employees have complained is bottlenecks and the appearance of an autocratic management
6652811 we want to be bold we want to make a big difference
6652812 a company filled with cutting edge ideas rigorous accountability and relentless attention to detail
6652813 these are people who think they are creating something thats the best in the world
6652814 googlers may relish their shot at impossible wealth they appear driven more by the quest for impossible perfection
6652815 but we think that flexibility gives you a better product are we right i think were right more important thats the sort of company i want to work for
6652816 if your actions inspire others to dream more learn more do more and become more you are a leader
6652817 we should take care not to make the intellect our god it has of course powerful muscles but no personality it cannot lead it can only serve
6652818 the very essence of leadership is that you have to have a vision its got to be a vision you articulate clearly and forcefully on every occasion
6652819 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
6652820 it is the mental picture that people conjure up when your name is mentioned
6652821 as long as you keep on doing the same thing you will keep on getting the same results
6652822 everyone has a chance to stand out everyone has a chance to learn improve and build up his or her skills everyone has a chance to be a brand worthy of remark
6652823 always be true to yourself and your vision it sounds obvious but really in my opinion it is the designers who stick to their beliefs and aesthetic that becomes successful if you bend with the wind if you slavishly follow trends then no one will know what you stand for and if you have passion be proud of it nurture it never give it up
6652824 google is not a conventional company we do not intend to become one
6652825 when you create a compelling brand you attract people who want the promise of your brand which you deliver
6652826 if you wish for anything very eagerly the whole world will conspire to give you that
6652827 our mind is our greatest friend and it is our greatest enemy
6652828 if people get down there on the floor and want to start blowing kazoos and making a scene we want to make sure weve got people who stand in front of them with obama signs
6652829 is it typical for a losing candidate to have their own whip team no but its also not usual for a losing candidate to get 18 million votes either
6652830 we have been and are working closely with the obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention
6652831 our delegate whips along with the obama delegate whips are a part of a team that will be on the floor of the convention to make sure delegates have everything they need whether thats answering questions or passing out signs during hillarys speech the whips are a traditional part of every conventions floor operations
6652832 does anyone believe this anyone hillary is going to do everything in her power to make sure barack loses this election you all know it
6652833 hillary almost won so just keep the faith till 2012 when she wins
6652834 id much rather have 4 bad mccain years followed by 8 good clinton years than obama as president at all its that simple and there are more than enough of us to decide this election
6652835 we thinking voters refuse to support obama because he is unfit to be potus because of a poor work ethic confused thinking process and immature damaged character
6652836 oh its not about race or patriotism its about judgement
6652837 it really never occurs to you that it is not hillarys fault that we thinking voters refuse to support obama because he is unfit to be potus because of a poor work ethic confused thinking process and immature damaged character
6652838 john mccain has done more to address climate change than any other republican
6652839 at least if hillary wins well have two candidates who love their country
6652840 of course not i mean you know there is no basis for that i take him on the basis of what he says you know there isnt any reason to doubt that
6652841 you said you take sen obama at his word that hes not you dont believe that hes
6652842 no no theres nothing to base that on as far as i know
6652843 look i have been the target of so many ridiculous rumors that i have a great deal of sympathy for anybody who gets you know smeared with the kind of rumors that go on all the time
6652844 of course not i mean you know there is no basis for that i take him on the basis of what he says you know there isnt any reason to doubt that
6652845 you said you take sen obama at his word that hes not you dont believe that hes
6652846 no no theres nothing to base that on as far as i know
6652847 look i have been the target of so many ridiculous rumors that i have a great deal of sympathy for anybody who gets you know smeared with the kind of rumors that go on all the time
6652848 im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore
6652849 flashback from the past wrote sieg heil sieg heil sieg heil or is it obama obama obama not a lot of difference from what i can see
6652850 if i blow myself up screaming allah is great ill go to heaven and finally get laid by 13 virgins
6652851 this is the most improper use of defence facilities for political purposes
6652852 and i heard lee is back in kl today why couldnt he najib have presented it here today why did he have to give it there
6652853 why does he najib use the air force base when he goes campaigning if he uses the international airport then it is alright
6652854 he najib represents the government i also represent the penang government but when i go to permatang pauh to campaign i use my private car rather than my official car
6652855 we have to draw the line between public purpose and private purpose if we cannot make that decision we are just encouraging money politics
6652856 wir d rfen eltern nicht daf r bestrafen dass sie kinder haben
6652857 meine vier kinder sind aus dem haus was brauch ich das noch
6652858 viele verzichten auf ein kind weil das geld einfach nicht reicht
6652859 wenn es berhaupt einen sinn im leben gibt dann sind es kinder
6652860 wie ich das geld ausgebe das ist eine frage der priorit ten und wir investieren halt in unsere kinder
6652861 denn eltern geben das weiter was sie selbst erlebt haben
6652862 ich w rde ihnen zustimmen wenn sichergestellt w re dass das geld bei den kindern ankommt
6652863 bei einer erzieherin plus zwei hilfskr fte auf 15 anderthalbj hrige da kann man nicht mehr von guter erziehung sprechen
6652864 finanzielle f rderung ohne gleichzeitige weiterbildung der eltern ist rausgeschmissenes geld
6652865 people have jumped to the conclusion that its because of the economy
6652866 it was a flight from singapore to siem reap it was a very rainy day
6652867 when staff did a go around of the aircraft after landing they discovered that one of the left hand tyres wasnt fully deflated but it obviously had some cuts on it and there was mud on the aircraft
6652868 there was not permanent damage to the aircraft and no injury to passengers
6652869 because there was only damage to the left hand wheels it would be incorrect to say that the aircraft totally left the runway there was nothing wrong with the right hand wheels
6652870 left the runway and blew a tyre and scraped the ground
6652871 weve been told that technical difficulties in siem reap have caused the cancellation for a full 24 hours
6652872 there continues to be reports that american servicemen are not being allowed to wear american flag patches on their uniforms there continues to be restrictions by the saudis on religious materials
6652873 ive discussed this with our commanding general h norman schwarzkopf and i am satisfied that our young men and women over there will be able to do what every other american family will be doing thanking god for our many blessings at christmas
6652874 when my forward commander radioed that they had reached the euphrates river i waited general he said ive got to tell you about the casualties i braced myself one man was slightly wounded thats when i knew god was with us
6652875 backfired a nation born for religious tolerance no longer tolerates religion
6652876 we know from experience that photojournalists love macs and that our software is used by a huge segment of this industry
6652877 our goal is to get them to fall in love with aperture but were perfectly happy to have them using other tools as well
6652878 these guys are working under incredibly tight deadlines and there are situations where theyre panicking
6652879 we can really say weve made significant inroads in this segment
6652880 particularly in delivering a quick editing workflow that can truly keep up with these guys
6652881 you see what these guys really need and what they go through and as a product manager its been amazing to spend that much time absorbing how people respond to our current product its worth more than a big stack of market research papers just to be able to work with these photographers
6652882 they have not been able to locate it on the premises and a letter drop has been done with the neighbours in the area
6652883 weve never felt this issue was something that would affect our long term business in the sense that were a policy enforcement platform that can comply with a wide range of policy directions and or regulations as it relates to what are reasonable and unreasonable policies
6652884 this order probably eliminates some of the uncertainty about what service providers might want to do
6652885 is oriented toward identifying the sources of congestion in a non applicaton specific way and applies policies to address that congestion to ensure fair use and fair access to network resources by a broad mix of users
6652886 weve always said it the delay would be a matter of minutes
6652887 our solution is not simply a single function single operation device it can be used in a variety of fashions
6652888 this incident does not appear to be related to them

6652890 this bill will put pressure on mr rudd to fully fund to support the local communities the local the local farms tourists operators the environment local programs that are being run to support the environment in what is an unfolding environmental economic tragedy he said
6652891 its extremely important that we get mr rudds attention while mr rudd is focused on what is happening overseas its important that he knows how bad this situation here is
6652892 jamie briggs is going the length and breadth of this community talking to small business people farmers local communities everyone who is concerned about the environment he is working tirelessly to see what the community wants to see the money spend on
6652893 everything from water carting to the preservation of turtles to the compensation of businesses to the lifting of boats that are stuck in mud to dealing in a financial way with the anguish that is felt by this community
6652894 that is not heard by mr rudd who seems indifferent to all of it the 50 million must be invested on those things the community itself see as important
6652895 either kevin rudd and penny wong support the bill or they demonstrate that they dont care about the people of the lower lakes
6652896 i think it would be really useful for our businesses which have been forgotten in this whole equation
6652897 if somebody called and said i can only come in on sunday hed open the store
6652898 he was very accommodating we only lived five doors down from the store at the time
6652899 the meat grinder sausage grinder bolted to the kitchen table

6652903 half of the elementary schools are in the middle of neighborhoods
6652904 this is an extremely innovative way to control the costs for the school and promote renewable energy in the state
6652905 they will put the pressure on their legislators with campaign contributions
6652906 they will mount a campaign against us like no tomorrow
6652907 comed is opposed to the bill and that opposition is based on the fact that it would allow some customers free access to the transmission and distribution system
6652908 comed would still be able to charge them for maintenance
6652909 im willing to amend the bill if we need to address that issue
6652910 we tried with comed and it didnt work out so were going to go this route
6652911 im going to do whatever i can to make sure this gets out of the house
6652912 now we just put our boxing gloves on and go at it
6652913 not only are you going to save on energy costs governments should be allowed to reduce enough electricity to cover all the costs of government administrative costs as well
6652914 when you have the economics of this behind you victory is all but inevitable
6652915 once the darn thing is paid for were looking at a reduction to our operating cost
6652916 its a positive way for school districts to reduce their operating expenses so less money goes to electricity and more money goes to education
6652917 you actually have to talk with them to find out why they dropped out and i think thats the part the students like the most
6652918 my paycheck id buy an outfit and id be broke
6652919 but the other side is theyre going to have a life that goes with it

6652924 my father earned the trust of democratic and republican governors senators and representatives
6652925 he was a player who was on a first name basis with top politicians he met presidents carter reagan and clinton
6652926 he told us what it was like to be in a submarine dodging mines in the pacific sea of japan and china sea
6652927 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
6652928 everything that has been received so far shows we have no problem of eligibility for these competitors
6652929 since asian bodies are not the same as westerners there have been questions but there shouldnt be
6652930 we make contact with residents towns we are spraying in person or by leaving a door hanger with information
6652931 thats why we want people to remain vigilant and continue to take precautions

6652939 we heard some brilliant misquotes during our research that had us in stitches
6652940 however theres a serious side to the survey as it highlights the sad fact that in the uk alone there is an estimate nine million people classed as deaf or hard of hearing and four million of those are not receiving any form of treatment at all
6652941 its alright its okay you make love the other way

6652957 quite simply the house bill will reward goliath by starving david
6652958 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
6652959 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
6652960 writing on our wall even more serious than the bloody riots of the last two weeks
6652961 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
6652962 if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their money first by inflation and then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered
6652963 then they dragged it to a closed tent and all the while they dragged it it was flapping its tail blowing out of its head and moving and trying to get away
6652964 it was so upsetting because euthanasia is meant to be an easy death and that whale did not have an easy death at all
6652965 that was the best way it could have been done
6652966 its a tragic end to a program that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6652967 it was a sad moment but it went quietly to sleep
6652968 vets who euthanased the animal said it was a smooth operation and the sedated animal remained stress free and calm throughout
6652969 i dont understand why they didnt let it die quietly
6652970 it was obviously distressed im 41 years old and almost collapsed
6652971 after this comedy of errors of the past few days i thought that they would euthanase it with some dignity
6652972 for gods sake its a baby its been through hell it was separated from its mother its been starved and confused
6652973 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin
6652974 that was a scene that we witnessed and then they towed the whale behind their national parks and wildlife boat it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat
6652975 we need to get the united nations involved here we have to do something
6652976 but there is no question that the public has to decide
6652977 this is the most promising thing ive seen in a while
6652978 whether they are going to threaten microsoft much less google thats another story
6652979 if it turns out that they have good relevancy i could see that the word of mouth
6652980 we are moving to a google that knows more about you
6652981 he was also a member of ibms strategy team for storage systems strategy worldwide and drove the development of the companys homeland security strategy
6652982 opettajat eiv t koskaan valittaneet liian suuria opetusryhmi mutta he kaipasivat tarvittaessa avustajia luokkiin jotta pystyv t keskittym n opettamiseen
6652983 these moms are worried but theyre just so proud of their kids who are willing to fight for their country it brings a sense of pride not many can understand
6652984 i havent done it before and ive been training to do it for the last 10 years the hardest part of deployment is leaving your family
6652985 rhondas been through deployments before she handles them pretty well
6652986 we want to let them know were behind the group 100 percent
6652987 were just there to help out and be available if families need help
6652988 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
6652989 a city that was not bound by morals or religion
6652990 dont drink the water they put something in it to make you forget i dont even remember how i got here
6652991 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
6652992 im doing what jesus did telling parables to explain gods word and ways to my kids
6652993 if we dont reinstitute the draft i dont thing we will have anybody to chase bin laden to the gates of hell
6652994 amy poehler about his unique revolutionary get out of debt program
6652995 when every single member country of the nsg has signed the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ctbt why should india get a free pass
6652996 pakistan has warned that carving out a huge exemption for india increases the risk of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent why should we allow india to vastly increase its nuclear weapons programme
6652997 as the end of his term nears president bush seeks to grant india a proliferation pardon excusing its past violations of arms control norms
6652998 the us today delivered to the nsg a draft rule change for india that undermines the entire international framework to limit spread of nuclear weapons bushs proposal contains no non proliferation controls whatsoever
6652999 since nsg can only change its rules by consensus every member has veto power over this disastrous attempt if these countries do not demand real non proliferation conditions on the proposed nuclear agreement with india the nsg may as well be voting itself out of existence

6653019 i felt like id do a lot better than this
6653020 when you practice and youre out there by yourself and you just want to turn it on and go you just go
6653021 im really disappointed in how flat i was in the last 200 meters
6653022 a lot of people dont understand that in running you practice different things just like a basketball team practices different plays you practice different segments of a race i really practiced closing it didnt work out well
6653023 ive got nothing else going on so i might as well
6653024 the other girls were just more ready to go it might just be one bad race its a shame it had to come at the olympics

6653029 ive got nothing else going on so i might as well
6653030 the other girls were just more ready to go it might just be one bad race its a shame it had to come at the olympics
6653031 aside from the disappointment of not making it and being under pressure for two weeks it was an amazing experience
6653032 we can look back and kick ourselves for the things we didnt do
6653033 but youve got to give them credit for the things they did do
6653034 we can look back and kick ourselves for the things we didnt do
6653035 but youve got to give them credit for the things they did do
6653036 everything was just kind of clicking i had a great start silver im psyched
6653037 we got three medals out of six thats pretty damn good
6653038 everything was just kind of clicking i had a great start silver im psyched
6653039 we got three medals out of six thats pretty damn good
6653040 i thought it was going to be a few girls from the gym and a few coaches so its a big surprise im still in shock that my dreams have come true its been a long month and i am really happy to be back in dallas
6653041 when i texted her that night she won all around i told her she would be doing interviews for hours but to call me when she can
6653042 we try to do things away from the gym and have girl nights
6653043 im going to probably keep them in my purse for now
6653044 between the two of us we have nine olympic medals so thats pretty amazing
6653045 i thought it was going to be a few girls from the gym and a few coaches so its a big surprise im still in shock that my dreams have come true its been a long month and i am really happy to be back in dallas
6653046 when i texted her that night she won all around i told her she would be doing interviews for hours but to call me when she can
6653047 we try to do things away from the gym and have girl nights

6653050 por essa raz o que a oi assinou o requerimento anatel solicitando que seja assegurado o prazo necess rio para que os testes sejam efetuados de maneira tecnicamente consistente
6653051 as operadoras sejam alvo de reclama es sobre a qualidade de seu servi o
6653052 esse um projeto grande que vai mudar toda a forma de encaminhamento das chamadas
6653053 n o adianta uma empresa estar preparada e outra para qual o cliente quer migrar n o
6653054 its like the city jobs you hear about where people show up and do no actual work
6653055 there is nothing comparable to living with a phenomenon when the phenomenon is you and you observe yourself with a cool intelligence your own and yet are trapped in the cruelest pit of the narcissist you not only are more interested in yourself than in anyone else alive but suffer from the likely suspicion that this may be justified you could be more interesting than anyone youve encountered
6653056 the night comes down with an incredibly heavy small town finality
6653057 we are establishing the wicell bank to grow test store and distribute cell lines that the national stem cell bank currently is unable to offer since it is limited to the 21 human embryonic stem cell lines approved for federal funding
6653058 we will follow methods protocols and quality control standards at the wicell bank similar to those weve developed and refined over the past three years for the national stem cell bank
6653059 its clear that they dont care what my opinion is
6653060 theres a great deal of concern among the public about destroying human embryos for research and those opinions should at the very least be respected and not ignored
6653061 all public polling has shown that the majority of people favor stem cell research in particular if you are talking about using excess embryos left over from in vitro fertilization i think in 10 years there will be three or four major research centers in the country that are on the cutting edge of stem cell research the question is is one of those going to be in wisconsin
6653062 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6653063 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6653064 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6653065 if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6653066 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6653067 la d cision du joueur et rappelle quil ne la
6653068 il na pas mis son veto lorsque pape diouf lui a demand son avis
6653069 jai voulu savoir aupr s du coach sil consid rait que ce d part cr ait un trou nous avons convenu que djibril pouvait partir avec lid e que dici la fin du mercato nous verrions comment reconfigurer notre effectif

6653071 je pensais quil reviendrait dans cette quipe que dans cet effectif largi il
6653072 il aurait jou dans les jours qui viennent confirme lentra neur il avait montr auparavant quil tait capable de surmonter de plus grands probl mes et s tait comport en vrai pro jesp rais quil se battrait jusquau bout il avait du mal accepter de ne pas commencer les deux derniers matches
6653073 a pose probl me car nous sommes en pleine comp tition mamad a parfois besoin de souffler des blessures peuvent arriver
6653074 ce ne sont pas les circonstances qui dicteront notre conduite nous ne recruterons que si notre conviction nous pousse le faire si nos techniciens ont le sentiment quil faut renforcer leffectif pour atteindre nos objectifs
6653075 nous verrons apr s d lib ration avec les techniciens nous avons des atouts offensifs mais avons nous tous les joueurs dont nous avons besoin un joueur au profil de djibril est il n cessaire doit il tre confirm ou jeune un joueur de rupture un joueur de profondeur nous nous posons les questions sereinement
6653076 notre philosophie est de prendre des joueurs qui connaissent le championnat de france nous avons rencontr un taux d chec plus important dans notre recrutement avec des joueurs qui ne connaissaient pas la ligue 1
6653077 the creative genius behind these works is inspiring and 1800 is thrilled to share these designs with the public
6653078 we hope the essential artists campaign will encourage other artists to make their dreams a reality
6653079 weve gotta get these kids ready to read by kindergarten the ones that cant read when 3rd grade starts end up across the street
6653080 im captain of this team and i want so badly to win gold
6653081 if theres anything i know about lauren its that if she could suck it up and play and finish the wnba season she would
6653082 that tells you something about the severity of the injury she cant walk and play without getting a shot
6653083 in india the product doesnt come with contract whereas in the us the product comes with contract where the phone is first subsidized and over the contract period the money is recovered from the user companies here usually dont encourage hand in subsidy
6653084 spybot search amp destroy to download it this is a free program
6653085 finding a replacement for dr rieck that brought all of his strengths will be difficult but were glad that he is willing to work with us in searching for his replacement
6653086 the board has made a lot of changes in the past four years
6653087 weve implemented schedule changes tightened and toughened up policies on cell phones electronic devices and attendance and we are looking for a leader who can hit the ground running
6653088 i think in any district youd be in theres more than enough work to be done and this district is no exception
6653089 there have been very few days where i havent looked forward to going to work
6653090 the two that we chose were heavily involved in the community they both had very strong interpersonal skills and shared a passion for activism
6653091 i rode a metra train today and it was overcrowded and everyone was inconvenienced
6653092 as a board im not sure this is the right time to do this
6653093 theres no question in my mind we need additional office space but before going forward with a boardroom it ought to be as plain and simple and inexpensive as can be
6653094 this isnt a research based decision its a budget based one
6653095 pulling our aides is opening the door for the district to keep taking from this successful program
6653096 as we were looking through our budget processes and staffing reviews we saw that this did not meet the standard of a 27 to 1 student teacher ratio for bilingual programs
6653097 i asked the county board to give me an opportunity to build a domestic violence court facility that is centrally located and that separates victims from perpetrators the minute they get to the courthouse
6653098 were interested in getting the word out that theyre not going to be standing alone
6653099 re examine operations at 555 w harrison street to ensure that the circuit court of cook county remains on the cutting edge in providing a safe and secure environment for the hearing of domestic violence matters
6653100 if i have to ask for more money ill do that
6653101 we are saddened that planned parenthood will be preying upon the vulnerable youth of dubuque sic as well as the tri state area all for the almighty dollar it is only appropriate that they are opening on a dark and dreary day
6653102 our politics have become so embedded and so partisan with so many special interests that they require a massive effort from the public telling them we want something done
6653103 the prospects of being born in the united states are still better than being born anyplace else in the world
6653104 it has not paid to sell america short since 1776 and the time to start is not in 2008
6653105 what we have to do is to recognize and reward elected officials democrats republicans independents whatever who tell the truth and who stand up and try to help make tough choices sooner rather than later to make sure that americas future is better than its past and reject the b s and the nothing types of solutions and platitudes that we hear from so many politicians today
6653106 i wish to know the truth whom should i date
6653107 therapy dogs are an aid in that they help to fill needs that cannot be met in other ways
6653108 they are a source of unconditional love and concentrated attention that provides relief a stimulus for exercise and also gives much pleasure to patients
6653109 this incident does not appear to be related to them
6653110 my mom couldnt control me i had so much energy that my parents decided to take me to this school
6653111 she is the real deal and she is wonderful to work with
6653112 we are a more technically driven school at state street she brings it exactly where ive always wanted it to go
6653113 most kids they just do it for fun but even if you do it for fun i think its important that you know what youre doing and that you know it well
6653114 every night wed see this woman tremendously beautiful in her 60s with a slash of scarlet lipstick and shed ride past us on a bicycle cigarette in one hand leaving a trail of smoke behind her i was fascinated by her who was she and more to the point what was she doing cycling along the beach at midnight and i decided to use that image as the basis for nan
6653115 we need to remember that this is in no way the be all and end all
6653116 our roads werent designed to accommodate trams if we occupy say two to three lanes with a tram where is there space for commuters who will invariably still use cars
6653117 the gold coast needs a public transport system that actually meets the needs of a community that is sprawled across 425 square metres of the length of the coast
6653118 people will not abandon the convenience of their car unless they can access efficient public transport within walking distance of their front gate
6653119 currently only 4 per cent or 65 000 trips are made by the coast community on public transport and with rapid transit it is projected to grow to 10 per cent by 2026
6653120 by making public transport faster more efficient and more reliable this project is estimated to take up to 40 000 car trips off the roads that will have a significant effect on future congestion and avoiding gridlock
6653121 get well and stay well while you are in the hospital
6653122 jason continues to recover maybe even better than what was expected
6653123 theres a history of housing segregation in illinois that has created a pattern of minorities living together in poorer areas and whites living together in wealthier areas
6653124 the process of school funding reform must be undertaken in a legislative forum rather than in the courts
6653125 there are new approaches that can be taken which is what i believe the chicago urban league is trying to do
6653126 its better of course for the elected representatives of the people to bring about this change but many courts around the country have done it
6653127 the tax swap proposals weve seen so far look like they would cause us to lose resources
6653128 now you want to win and saying it doesn t make it so
6653129 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say let s toss the bums out toss the bums out we re starting from scratch we re starting over this is not working
6653130 he threw a lot of strikes got deep into the game
6653131 he was a nice kid a friendly guy he didnt get into trouble he was at home most of the time he always helped people out if he could
6653132 maybe he was too nice he kept himself to himself he didnt get involved in trouble
6653133 almost every one of them will transfer to somewhere else
6653134 i feel so bad for these families that are going to be faced with these kinds of decisions what do you do
6653135 the best available option for the department at this time is to close pontiac
6653136 pontiac and this state have had a wonderful partnership for more than 130 years
6653137 i look around and see everything that we do have
6653138 you know weve worked hard the last 20 years how would we ever start over
6653139 i dont look at what blagojevich says any more i look at what he does
6653140 the only thing that can save the prison right now is when the guy signs the piece of paper that says its no longer going to close
6653141 half of the elementary schools are in the middle of neighborhoods
6653142 this is an extremely innovative way to control the costs for the school and promote renewable energy in the state
6653143 they will put the pressure on their legislators with campaign contributions
6653144 they will mount a campaign against us like no tomorrow
6653145 comed is opposed to the bill and that opposition is based on the fact that it would allow some customers free access to the transmission and distribution system
6653146 comed would still be able to charge them for maintenance
6653147 im willing to amend the bill if we need to address that issue
6653148 we tried with comed and it didnt work out so were going to go this route
6653149 im going to do whatever i can to make sure this gets out of the house
6653150 now we just put our boxing gloves on and go at it
6653151 not only are you going to save on energy costs governments should be allowed to reduce enough electricity to cover all the costs of government administrative costs as well
6653152 when you have the economics of this behind you victory is all but inevitable
6653153 once the darn thing is paid for were looking at a reduction to our operating cost
6653154 its a positive way for school districts to reduce their operating expenses so less money goes to electricity and more money goes to education
6653155 he was very forward thinking and he really worked to build community
6653156 he was really dynamic and so invested in the building faith campaign
6653157 he had so much energy and this great sense of humor that he drew people to him
6653158 through the sacraments of baptism and all the marriages and funerals he will be greatly missed
6653159 these moms are worried but theyre just so proud of their kids who are willing to fight for their country it brings a sense of pride not many can understand
6653160 i havent done it before and ive been training to do it for the last 10 years the hardest part of deployment is leaving your family
6653161 rhondas been through deployments before she handles them pretty well
6653162 we want to let them know were behind the group 100 percent
6653163 were just there to help out and be available if families need help
6653164 it gives us a chance to have fun together an important component of being a family of faith
6653165 we like to welcome everyone it enriches who we are and lets them know about who we are
6653166 the pharaoh is an elvis impersonator ive never done that in my life
6653167 i get to use a french accent and im sure im butchering it terribly
6653168 theyve noticed im probably a ham and could pull it off
6653169 get to know the students of welch elementary school and assist staff and parents in meeting the needs of the students
6653170 i am a sixth generation napervillian i enjoy serving the community in which i grew up
6653171 my goal is to facilitate the academic emotional and behavioral growth of all students
6653172 i am a die hard cubs fan the first game i ever saw was ken holtzmans no hitter in 1969 and i have enjoyed displaying my cubs w flag many times during the course of the season
6653173 my goal for the year is to help our teaching staff develop excellence in every endeavor with our students if you drive by wvhs you will notice the green and gold banner at the entrance reminding everyone to do work for excellence
6653174 i helped my parents on our hog farm in franklin grove if i get a free couple of days i will spend it on an ocean beach and would love to be a professional beach bum we moved back to illinois because our families are here five children five grandchildren four sisters one brother a multitude of cousins and my parents yes we know the winters are rough but it is worth it to be home
6653175 my goal is to make sure mvhs is up and running by august 2009
6653176 i greatly enjoyed experiencing communities in cape town south africa in early june with the wvhs mosaic choir
6653177 ive had a blast i wasnt afraid or anything im so glad i was able to embark on this journey
6653178 just another way to help them out and just another way for me to follow my passions
6653179 acabar con las barreras que impiden a la gente a conectarse
6653180 in general we appreciate tsa support for security of aircraft
6653181 but its quite obvious this inspector was not properly trained
6653182 its fortunate for him the aircraft had not recently been operating
6653183 there has been an increase in the number of affluent consumers compared to before
6653184 we target the new rich who have enough money to keep using the cream at this price on a long term basis
6653185 as we stand here i still absolutely believe that my client is innocent
6653186 why is it that every child that comes into contact with him is broken
6653187 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children
6653188 i thought things would go the justice way but justice is fickle i guess
6653189 i honestly dont know why it went the way it did this is the first time ive heard all this stuff that the d a is putting out that is not my child
6653190 quello che basta quando mi sveglio mi alzo delle volte dormo di pi e delle volte di meno quando mi sveglio e mi sento bene mi alzo trovo il sonno come una morte desidero vedere il pi possibile avr molto tempo per dormire
6653191 during the process of the last album i had a fear the band was losing its way
6653192 we had eight months of sitting around we finished that record and i hated it michael and mike couldnt make up their minds
6653193 i kept saying look how great we are live we need to get some of that into a record but no one would agree with me no one came out and loved that record
6653194 when we finished that record i really felt wed made a really great record
6653195 but you can never count on peoples responses i dont know how we would have responded if people had hated it but everyone i played it to gave me a great response it restored my faith
6653196 its just a positive to be around as long as we have been but this is our fourteenth album and to make an album that people think is among our best at this stage is really rewarding
6653197 man sized wreath was supposed to be a b side but people wrote to us and said please put it on the album a lot of the tempos were picked up and the arrangements got tightened
6653198 but theyre not all good the secret is being able to edit yourself
6653199 you have to write the bad ones to get to the great ones and knowing that difference is the main thing
6653200 people are still upset by iraq by the terror threat the lack of effort to clean up after hurricane katrina
6653201 im fairly pessimistic i could see how the democrats could blow it and the fear factor could make people vote for the republican party
6653202 a recent poll said that 81 per cent of americans think the country is going in the wrong direction i cant claim to be an authority on american politics but america is a big country it should be able to make things happen
6653203 it all started when i was six years old it was the beatles they changed my life and put me on this path
6653204 there were other artists from that period like the lovin spoonful and then i heard punk rock and that changed my life in ways you wouldnt believe patti smith the ramones television and then more recently ive been listening to the new albums by the black keys nick cave and portishead
6653205 they were getting to the stage where theyd heard all my music
6653206 i wanted them to hear more so i put all sorts of music on there new and old theyre really proud of me but they make a point of behaving like dads not super cool im pleased about that though
6653207 ill have my year off when im 80 or something
6653208 the kane county health department will be conducting an on site inspection of the walter paytons roundhouse after several complaints about flies within the meals

6653215 while i sent the e mail from my city of aurora e mail address during the workday i did not act as a city employee in doing so and did not intend to make it appear that way i sent the e mail as an individual and the thoughts and words of the message are mine alone
6653216 no one at the city gave me permission to send the e mail and i did not receive permission after the fact for sending it i apologize if it appeared that the city issued a health warning for the roundhouse because i did not intend for that to happen
6653217 i cant believe hes still employed but as long as the city keeps him on im going to assume they endorse his actions
6653218 walter paytons name is on this restaurant and we keep it there with as much respect as it deserves for this guy to talk about walter paytons roundhouse like that thats where i draw the line
6653219 my attorneys are involved and i intend to pursue this as far as i can
6653220 i think the guy didnt like the barbecue sauce dressing combination he created on the salad and tried to give it back so we comped it
6653221 but he became rude and made quite a scene when we wouldnt refund him for the burger that he finished
6653222 the inspectors notes found fewer than 10 fruit flies in the bar area and confirmed the establishment has regular pest control services
6653223 ultimately the roundhouse received a score of 90 which is considered a very good score
6653224 when it was first put to me in the spring or summer of 2007
6653225 i was told that eurostar wanted to make a feature film about kids possibly in paris or possibly in london places that the eurostar went to when i heard it was a feature film with commercial backing i thought its not really my cup of tea
6653226 my worry was that it was going to be shots of blokes in trains smiling patting kids on the head and saying have a nice day on the eurostar i couldnt quite understand why theyd asked me so i pulled out of the project
6653227 then i said they should speak to paul fraser the guy id co written with because hes worked on a couple of kids feature film scripts that are currently in development
6653228 so i was really happy read the script and it was fantastic i was quite baffled that they were going to give me carte blanche to make it as if it was my own film
6653229 i fell in love with it when i saw the relationship between the two boys
6653230 this idea of this rough renegade kid from the midlands and this sweet artistic lad from poland whos quite lonely they get forced together and fall in love with this french waitress it reminded me of a lot of new wave french cinema and i thought id like to have a go at it
6653231 we laid out this 10 day shoot and a couple of days rehearsal and when we started to rehearse things started to expand the father and son piotr and ireneusz were from poland and they gelled really quickly
6653232 the additional freedom that i had from eurostar sponsoring it was that it didnt matter how long or short it was so when i cut it i was able to simply make it work at the perfect length for the story in its own right
6653233 i decided to take a year off after this is england to take stock and look at doing a bigger project in my year off which was meant to be my quietest year
6653234 i made somers town then i made another film with paddy considine called le donk which was meant to be a short but turned into a feature
6653235 out of all of them somers town was the biggest surprise to me
6653236 i have a lot of good memories of creamfields over the years
6653237 the one that springs to mind now however is just daft i remember being slotted to dj after the gorillaz in one of the tents a few years back and heading towards the stage to make sure i was in good time for the end of their set
6653238 of course the gorillaz were playing behind a huge screen as part of the show so no one could see what they were doing
6653239 i couldnt get away with just putting on a bad hawaiian shirt and playing some records
6653240 ive done some music with iggy pop on one of the tracks
6653241 also jack penate david byrne dizzee rascal and martha wainwright as well as justin robertson and ashley beedle
6653242 its a shadowy set up that we revisit now and again truth be told i actually forgot id done it until recently when my engineer dug up the tapes in the studio and told me it was really good
6653243 that means the bus can travel as far as gurnee and libertyville for people who have doctor appointments there
6653244 it was such a great deal that we just couldnt pass it up
6653245 we are planning on putting in a schedule of sorts where the bus will head to condell medical center in libertyville one day then to northern illinois medical center in mchenry one day to help out the seniors who need to go to the doctor
6653246 we are also looking for and applying for grants to offset the cost of operating the bus five days a week rather than just three days
6653247 basically if the fox lake shuttle service goes to dominicks or jewel for groceries then theres no reason why we should follow the same route
6653248 but there are plenty of places to go in the township that other buses do not go
6653249 its just another way for residents in need of transportation in the township to get around
6653250 you get to the point where you feel youve done pretty much everything in europe in the name of promotion
6653251 though i think singing murder on the dancefloor in holland on a podium in the middle of an ice rink with skaters going around me was a highlight it was just me and leo sayer on that show
6653252 i had to do most of my christmas shopping there
6653253 we had a couple of really good christmas parties she recalls
6653254 my favourite was the one where we all had to do a turn gary and his wife did magic tricks and we all did a pantomime
6653255 it was a version of blind date and i played a cross between cilla black and the fairy godmother
6653256 to be honest i mostly go out to gay clubs
6653257 i think most women prefer them because the atmosphere is much better and all the blokes dance with you
6653258 im quite a good barometer because if were in a disco im more likely to dance than he is hell try and play a really cool soulwax remix of you cant always get what you want by the rolling stones and im more into classics like toni basils mickey
6653259 its a dark little fairytale about a boy whos made a pig and goes around this little town stealing womens high heeled shoes its quite fantastical
6653260 well nothing serious i think i can kind of relate to that katy perry thing you know
6653261 its something most girls can relate to when youre 15 or 16 but ive never taken a girl home to meet my mum famed blue peter milf janet ellis if thats what you mean
6653262 and its a great song and its by cathy dennis who really can do no wrong
6653263 its not just in you its in every choice you make
6653264 but the thing is ive never asked chris to mention the bingo show if anything the shouldnt really be mentioning it because they are bbc and were itv he just took it upon himself and its just snowballed from there really his support means so much
6653265 the wedding date has changed three times so has the location but its all definitely taking shape now its crept up on us so quickly
6653266 since ive had nicole as long as she is happy and healthy i dont really care about anything else when youre young its all about you but now its all for her shes the best job ive ever had
6653267 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6653268 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6653269 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6653270 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6653271 it could go back for miles and miles and theres no real mechanism to stop it
6653272 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6653273 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6653274 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6653275 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6653276 apparent strategy was to put more of a focus on gaming for the 2008 edition
6653277 hopefully a bigger and stronger digitallife will return in 2009
6653278 i have never lived in zion have never taught school in zion and i most certainly have never coached soccer in zion
6653279 there may be some sports i would be capable of coaching but soccer is not one of them
6653280 the withdrawal is not happening very quickly if it in fact has begun
6653281 the withdrawal needs to take place and needs to take place now
6653282 there will be no buffer zones we will never live with any buffer zones well never allow anything like this
6653283 it is truly tragic that pakistan has fallen repeatedly into the hands of leaders unable to put their own interests on the backburner and place those of the country at the forefront
6653284 we continue to put ourselves in position day in and day out to win games
6653285 we have a good team we have good chemistry a lot of things are really working in our favor right now
6653286 it was a big win for us were really confident weve been able to find a way to win ballgames that is something we werent doing early in the year
6653287 i didnt feel like i had to pitch around anything

6653292 we feel like both of them have had great camps but kevins going to take the first snaps and well see how it goes from there
6653293 nate will play in the game i dont know exactly when but kevin will start
6653294 you actually have to talk with them to find out why they dropped out and i think thats the part the students like the most
6653295 my paycheck id buy an outfit and id be broke
6653296 but the other side is theyre going to have a life that goes with it

6653298 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6653299 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6653300 be open to the miracles that life throws at you
6653301 i was teaching in california and somehow i fell into administration it seemed quite natural
6653302 i took a deep breath when i was offered this position
6653303 i would love hawaiianuiakea to be seen not only in hawaii but internationally as a leader in indigenous knowledge a leader in creating healthy strong and vibrant communities and a leader in language and culture
6653304 for hawaiians we go back to maoli our stories that can tell us where we came from and what we value if you can go back to that source collectively then the answers and direction become clear
6653305 when i moved to michigan state university i was the only female of color and the only junior professor i sat around the table with white men who were all full professors with long careers
6653306 i had to learn how to approach each of them from who i am i am a kanaka maoli woman a scholar a wife they had to learn that
6653307 the same is true for when i come back home i need to take time to tell people who i am and what i believe in
6653308 i believe she will be able to bring all that she has learned from those experiences and enrich our school
6653309 she is very balanced in both cultural and spiritual matters as well as in academics and administration
6653310 i always think that you stand on the shoulders of those who have come before you and you better hope like hell that you do well because they are watching you
6653311 so many wonderful people such as haunani kay trask lilikala kameeleihiwa and jon osorio have really shaped our school
6653312 they are pioneers in hawaiian studies they have created an environment in which we can not only learn about our hawaiian culture but we can see it smell it taste it touch it hear it and live it the collective leadership framework a workbook for cultivating and sustaining community change
6653313 if we ever go to finland after the kids are grown youre going to have to try a
6653314 i am not eating any dukey and thats that even in finland thats where i draw the line
6653315 its a tutti its the best ice cream youll ever eat
6653316 we havent done this before and we recognize that as a council and so were trying to do our due diligence that we do dot our is and cross all our ts
6653317 i think the pros just so heavily outweigh the cons that the action we need to take is really clear
6653318 it sounds like the city council wants to be certain that theyre getting what they are buying
6653319 wij analyseren onafgebroken al onze kostenplaatsen we gaan na hoe we kunnen besparen zonder daarbij de kwaliteit van onze productie uit het oog te verliezen
6653320 er werden tal van klachten van overlast genoteerd van omwonenden n van voorbijgangers die lastig werden gevallen onlangs nog werd een gehandicapte de weg versperd en lastig gevallen
6653321 this is really the result of two years of very hard work
6653322 she tried too hard and tackled that turn just a little bit too tight i knew i had to take it wider not to lose speed in the final stretch
6653323 its a challenge for the batsmen theres no point playing on flat tracks and scoring 300 runs all the time
6653324 from a players point of view this is a great challenge you need to play on these kind of wickets it does a bit with the new ball for a while and then settles in once you get in its a very good wicket to bat on the ball is coming nicely to the bat and theres a bit of bounce you cant ask for flat tracks where you can score 300 runs all the time it is great one day cricket
6653325 this was a very deceptive wicket i thought there was less grass and perhaps it wouldnt assist the seamers
6653326 but there was some help for the fast bowlers consistently
6653327 its really tough for the bowlers in sri lanka most of the time in sri lanka its not a bowlers paradise
6653328 dambulla gives assistance to the fast bowlers but otherwise its tough conditions hot and humid after the initial overs you have to bend your back to even get seam movement i dont think theyll get these kinds of wickets in the coming three games
6653329 i think were free to play if it happens but personally i cant see it happening weve been called to pakistan recently to fill in for the aussies and well do it again if we get invited
6653330 if we play good cricket we can definitely beat you
6653331 i was part of the dressing room once and sachin tendulkar was pulling my leg and making me feel at home i wanted to experience that feeling again
6653332 he is very talented thats why he is here he has performed well in the domestic circuit and has been a part of every india a tour this was his first game and he was under pressure especially playing against murali and mendis but i thought he negotiated them really well
6653333 he took up the challenge and responsibility to score those runs that was a good effort by the youngster and its good to have him in the side
6653334 he badrinath certainly had the pressure of scoring those runs that will give him more confidence and more experience you dont have to play 100 games to get experience the more you are in these situations the more comfortable you are in dealing with them in future a lapse of concentration against good bowlers will get you out
6653335 the credit should go to the fast bowlers especially bowling in tough hot and humid conditions zaheer particular bowled well he has been consistent for the last four years i have seen him bowl like this for sometime now he is always there he has moved way ahead even when it comes to his fielding even in england he bowled really well
6653336 whenever you give him the ball he will give more than 100 percent its really good to have a bowler like him
6653337 no doubt that mendis performance in the on going india sri lanka series is very good but media has highlighted him a bit too prominently it is too early to say if he will continue to perform like this for long
6653338 so far mendis has done extraordinary well and launched his cricket career in a marvellous way but indian batsmen are capable enough to tackle his bowling
6653339 government should concentrate to all sports if india likes to improve its tally in the medal list of olympic
6653340 i have no policy to revoke his passport or doing anything on that
6653341 given that derivatives markets have become a vital component of the financial system the bank believes that the expert panel should consider the regulation of these markets
6653342 ive done things this year that i havent done in 10 years
6653343 sellers are thinking last year buyers are thinking next year
6653344 the challenge for many sellers is determining the right price for todays market conditions
6653345 i say to them wow im not sure thats going to happen
6653346 ive actually turned down more listings this year than ive ever done because sellers are way up there
6653347 i just dont need my for sale sign on the lawn if it doesnt sell
6653348 once kids are back in school the buyers are out people love coming out in the fall
6653349 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6653350 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6653351 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6653352 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6653353 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6653354 rbc is committed to addressing the problem of retail clients who hold auction rate securities
6653355 we have expressed our willingness to work with regulators to develop and implement a program to provide liquidity to certain individual clients and small businesses and charities
6653356 hes not one of them he never was one of them
6653357 in my view hes never been accepted by the horsey set
6653358 he was absolutely suicidal we were so scared we were losing him
6653359 we want it known that we disagree strongly disagree with the selection we want the public the media and our sponsors to know weve done all we could to not accept him
6653360 i worked from the bottom up as a groom it was a lot of years of hard work thats where the tears on the medal podium come from
6653361 hes turned his life around and no one knows how
6653362 but the sports establishment came down so hard on him its great to sit in judgment
6653363 im so impressed with his character his strength and his discipline
6653364 he stops and says you know i really want to win for canada i want to win for my country erics a proud guy he was just driven by this
6653365 who showed me great support at a time when that was not so easy

6653382 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6653383 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6653384 sikandar is from an impoverished family in jharkhand but he has immense talent and a sharp mind
6653385 i saw him in a bengali film called shadows of time directed by german director florian gallenberger no one knew what happened to sikandar after the movie but i knew he was the right face and personality to play my johnny
6653386 she rediscovered sikandar as a camera assistant in one of the dingy studios of kolkata sikandar has lived up to all my expectations in tera kya hoga johnny now hes my responsibility
6653387 ideally id have liked to adopt sikandar legally but at 17 hes too old for adoption so ive given him everything that i would have as an adoptive parent he lives in my place permanently and all his expenses are borne by me now that the film is over i intend to put him in a college and see him educated
6653388 those who saw the movie told the authorities they were shocked to find that bachchan played the role of god
6653389 such films should not be released anywhere in the world because they are not only against islamic teachings but are against the teachings of all heavenly religions
6653390 i am urging people to watch my film because the idea and its treatment is very fresh it is a very out of the box comedy
6653391 if people dont watch and encourage such films filmmakers will use the same old formulas of nri films and boy meets girl kind of scripts
6653392 my film is a satire a black comedy it has all the madness a comedy has and is also packed with moral values
6653393 the theatre company performs this play titled mughal e azam in which characters perform multiple roles the performances are interactive it is genuinely a fresh comedy
6653394 not really i signed rahul first and never thought mallika will agree because i thought both would be doing pyaar ke side effects 2 but after a point i took a chance and she agreed
6653395 ive not treated the film in jaane bhi do yaaro style but my approach to maan gaye was similar to the former film
6653396 itll be an intense love story shot in english there are only two characters father and son ill play the fathers role and for the sons role i will be sign a big star or a trained actor who is good at english
6653397 the rest of the cast will be from the country where it will be shot be it germany scotland or france
6653398 i have done everything this film is for my growth lets see how this international project works out
6653399 when i was in america i came to know that norah jones is pt ravi shankars daughter immediately the thought struck my mind that an american girl born of indian musician father wins grammy awards on her own will make a great story
6653400 i stayed there for two months to meet various people and gathered all the relevant information then i completed the script
6653401 it is not a biography on pt ravi shankar i met him there and explained that i am not making a biography on him otherwise i would have taken his permission
6653402 the thought or the idea inspired me and so i have written the script from it
6653403 im delighted by how good mallika is at comedy i play the guy who tries to get her attention right under her husband paresh rawals nose
6653404 mallika is part of the theatre repertory in the film in fact all the principal actors mallika paresh who plays her husband kay kay menon and zakir hussain are part of the theatre group
6653405 im not part of the theatre group im a raw agent who needs to save the world by taking the help of the theatre company containing probably the worlds worst actors so the worlds worst theatre group is helping me to save the world
6653406 the only thing that this theatre group can do effectively on stage is a rendition of k asifs film mughall e azam thats where my salim act with anarkali comes in im only fantasising about being on stage with mallika
6653407 it has been a great learning experience to work with the little girl as i have never acted with a child before unlike adults children are natural actors and they dont care about practicalities of life
6653408 she is a perfect actor and i even learnt from her how to give a shot watching her act was really a treat
6653409 i play aarti who is superstitious and also believes in god my role in the film is close to what i am in real life because i believe in good and evil spirits
6653410 i have not planned anything whatever plans ramuji has for me i accept it as of now he has not approached me for any other film but if he offers anything i will be glad to accept it
6653411 i dont even want to talk about her but i was very hurt i really like rakhi why was she talking this way about me without knowing the facts how does she know the facts about how contestants were chosen i dont think its right for anyone to shoot off her mouth in this way you may have an outspoken image that youre always eager to uphold but please dont flaunt that image at my cost
6653412 its the channels prerogative to select or reject a candidate until two days prior to the show i didnt even know who was going the format doesnt allow the host to know the contestants mr athavle claims he was dropped on discriminatory grounds because he was a dalit and sanjay nirupam was taken instead
6653413 why was i being blamed if a candidate didnt make it into big boss why were they throwing stones at the channel colors office and burning my effigy they even held a dharna in lonavla in front of the big boss house why me every time im associated with something people try to use my name for their own purposes please leave me alone
6653414 i think i should take all this attention as a compliment but somewhere it does take its toll on my mental equilibrium we all need to be more responsible about our duties as a citizen my phone went ballistic on tuesday im in the midst of a dozen things and then to be badgered like this im human and i dont like my name being constantly used dont hit where it hurts the most i think they should start auctioning my effigies
6653415 but really rakhi sawant takes the cake what authority does she have to make such charges against me id have rakhi know that its the channels prerogative to decide the participants im hired by the channel to do a job my jurisdiction is to go on stage and host the show
6653416 his cousin said vincent was playing in the ditch and he was going to go back to call his friends to where he was playing
6653417 it doesnt appear she was speeding and she didnt have a stop sign

6653419 i will be working with shah rukh khan for don 2 we will begin shooting for it in the second half of next year
6653420 my office will have a selection process that is open and transparent and i will carefully review and research the qualifications and experience that each panelist could bring to the missouri supreme court
6653421 despite its reputation for sunny hot and muggy weather august actually is the second wettest month of the year in galveston county it turns out that the heavy rains weve seen over the past couple of weeks are not that rare for this time of year
6653422 that depends on how big fannie and freddie blow up
6653423 some hit is going to come from existing preferred shareholders
6653424 theres not protection for shareholders of common or preferred shares
6653425 i was so angered by their sneakiness that i paid off and terminated my citicard account immediately
6653426 less risky borrowers will have to absorb the costs posed by riskier borrowers if issuers cant price everyone based on the risk they pose
6653427 instead of teasing people with low introductory rates giving cards to anyone who breathes and then hitting them with fees and penalties on the back end lenders can still price for risk they just have to do it on the front end

6653443 the economy has really shown one sign after another of weakening
6653444 while were well along in the credit crunch were in the peak of its impact on the economy
6653445 demand remains weak enough that its going to maintain pressure on manufacturing for some time
6653446 despite the continued weakness in the economy and in the mens apparel business we saw an improvement in our sales performance trends this past quarter
6653447 although overall store traffic continues to be down our conversion rates and average sales transactions are up which indicate to us we are executing well in this difficult retail environment
6653448 you really dont want to be pushing too much higher on price
6653449 if you go much higher than three percent then consumers start to revolt even at a fast food store
6653450 the closer examination of sales will reveal that even in this soft retail environment across america the book business is stubbornly holding up

6653472 in modern day football its not who is the starting tailback who is the starting fullback other than the quarterback and the offensive line who are a little more traditional in that sense for everybody else its hey were going to put them in where theyre going to be used best well slide them around and move them around depending on what their skill sets are

6653487 its very important to get started early go out there and establish ourselves in the run game passing game all of the above
6653488 we want to get off to a good start from the first drive on just to establish something so that when we get to the first regular season game it will be more natural for us its still preseason so its basically like a glorified practice but we want to be better than we were last week a lot better
6653489 if we can stay free of the injury bug then we should be ok

6653492 on the defensive side of the football we were just completely disappointed with the entire effort
6653493 there was a lot at stake out there tonight and we wanted to come out and show what type of defense were going to be for the season
6653494 if we play like that obviously were going to be a pretty bad defense its going to be a replay of how we were last year 28th 29th in the league very disappointing
6653495 aduh gmn ya kyknya ga bisa deh tanggal segitu gw ada pesta untuk merayakan bisul gw yang akhirnya sembuh
6653496 the information held by the foreign secretary is not merely necessary but essential if binyam mohamed is to have his case fairly considered
6653497 we believe there will be information helping to corroborate binyan mohameds story
6653498 he says it was during this time that he was tortured and this will obviously affect his case

6653512 we are delighted that indians are making their mark in various disciplines in the ongoing olympics
6653513 sportsmen like sushil kumar and abhinav bindra olympics gold medal winner for air rifle shooting have paved the path for more success to follow
6653514 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6653515 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6653516 the russian georgia conflict has disrupted supplies and it looks like it will drag on and create a lot of uncertainty
6653517 there is a real need for strengthening the capacity of countries particularly in africa in coping with such climate shocks
6653518 the negotiations need to speed up and become more concrete if governments are to meet the deadline they set for themselves
6653519 there has been no single country that has spoken against
6653520 they would like to see it implemented in different ways but nobody has tried to kill the proposal off everyone wants it to happen
6653521 agreeing to halve emissions by 2050 is one thing we must have midterm targets

6653523 doddering old mcsame is so rich he cant even count his houses
6653524 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6653525 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6653526 the deterioration of the business environment at a national level has forced many companies to cancel their official registration and shifted their business underground for tax evasion
6653527 might well have misjudged what was appropriate physical expression especially given the atmosphere of adult child contacts in our society at present
6653528 our work brings us into intimate contact with peoples lives
6653529 in a time when the exchange of simple affection within the most intimate of circles has become a rare commodity our associations with others run the grave risk of being misunderstood by all parties including perhaps the priest himself
6653530 i began to live a duel life by day i investigated the local dioceses dug up documents in courthouses talked with a seemingly endless string of victims and interviewed bishops their aides attorneys and priests in my off hours i put in my final months of training to become a catholic

6653539 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6653540 this negative campaign ad is clearly express advocacy and under a federal law passed in 2003 the bi partisan campaign reform act known colloquially as mccain feingold it cannot legally be paid for with corporate money including those of a non profit
6653541 the ad indisputably concerns an election takes a position on the character and fitness for office of a candidate and raises no legislative issue even this highly skeptical supreme court would turn up its noses at the foul odor emitted by this clear abuse of federal election law
6653542 in november 2003 secretary rumsfeld and senator mccain had one of a number of conversations that ended with the two in agreement on the need to win in iraq
6653543 senator mccain may prefer to characterize their meeting as a showdown at the ok corral but thats not straight talk its a fairy tale
6653544 i had breakfast with senator mccain he said the answer may not be more troops in iraq but the answer is not the status quo i agree with him
6653545 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it

6653547 what does it mean for us to love not the world both individually and communally
6653548 were doing everything we can to get these turbines up and spinning in massachusetts
6653549 if nobody else steps up to the plate theres still a good chance of us getting them
6653550 if they do sell them its not a big loss
6653551 we kind of told the mtc that very early into september were going to order the other turbines
6653552 its not something we are proud of that happened but its a fact
6653553 it has become a mystery that enthralls people and to that extent id love to see businesses here take advantage of that
6653554 about 600 000 tourists come to salem looking for the dark side of history
6653555 the majority of the people that are walking past our door have no idea even what state the borden murders took place much less what city
6653556 by us explaining to them the place that the murders happened is only 80 miles south of here its going to drive traffic to fall river
6653557 the bottom line is that air gun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
6653558 the study has greatly contributed to our knowledge of sperm whales but its also raised new questions we need to know more about such as their feeding and breeding patterns
6653559 theres still a lot we dont know about these huge creatures
6653560 if you want programs to continue and grow instead of being cut back the only way to make that happen is to get more revenue

6653563 the indian market has discerning buyers who are prepared to pay for luxury provided the quality and overall experience is superior
6653564 there are possibilities that the group will tie up with banks in india
6653565 we are working out the details for india which will be completed this year
6653566 oil prices are influenced by the us dollars retreat and diplomatic tensions between the us and russia
6653567 its extremely bittersweet im thrilled that it passed and i hope and believe that my daughter had something to do with it
6653568 it makes her passing stand for something and that gives us some solace
6653569 massachusetts has been a leader in expanding health insurance for all of its citizens and now we are focused on meeting the needs of every child
6653570 there are too many children in the commonwealth who go undiagnosed or untreated for mental illness
6653571 this new law will help seal the cracks in our system
6653572 in both cases it was important that the crews had vhf radios aboard their vessels and made us aware of the problems they were having
6653573 the early notice allowed us to assess the situation and make plans accordingly
6653574 five ways to get more fruit and veg world cancer research fund
6653575 i know for sure what jesus would not do would be to sweep into a community gather up large numbers of people separate them from one another and deport them to another country in my own mind in my own conscience thats crystal clear jesus would not do that
6653576 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive
6653577 we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection
6653578 would be better served by helping individuals to comply with the law or working to change those laws rather than asking law enforcement agents not to enforce it
6653579 if you choose to become a law enforcement officer you swear to uphold the laws of the state and the nation
6653580 thats what you do you dont want to do that then dont become a law enforcement officer
6653581 i think its an interesting idea because from our reports a lot of these raids have really impacted families and individuals and really terrorized communities
6653582 it should be logical that some agents think that tactic is too harsh and might not want to participate
6653583 anything on roadways and lawns will get washed into the water
6653584 we have our fingers crossed on the test result coming in favorably
6653585 de sidste to r har vi ekspanderet med omkring syv butikker om ret for halvandet r siden havde vi ni butikker nu har vi 23
6653586 det g r hurtigt og derfor var det en absolut n dvendighed at f et centralt styret system ind da vi har haft travlt med at ekspandere har konomisystemet m ske v ret nedprioriteret fordi vi ikke har haft tid det var vigtigere at f produceret og solgt is
6653587 det var planen at vi skulle have m nedsrapportering fra hver enkelt butik men det kom aldrig rigtigt til at fungere butikkerne havde sv rt ved at fremsende balancer og s videre hver m ned de sendte balancer som pdf filer eller excel regneark hvilket bet d at vi fik en masse manuelt arbejde det var alt alt for tungt
6653588 et af vores krav var at systemet skulle v re internetbaseret s alle franchisetagere kunne g p og f adgang til systemet
6653589 jeg har v ret revisor i 10 r og set en del konomisystemer de kan ekstremt meget men samtidigt er de k mpestore og komplekse de rigtig gamle konomisystemer som pcplus var s simple at enhver med bare lidt kendskab til regnskab kunne betjene systemerne det var ret afg rende at vores kommende system var s enkelt at bruge at man ikke skulle p tre dages kursus inden man kom i gang
6653590 e conomic kan lige n jagtigt de grundl ggende ting og s kan man tilknytte ekstra ting hvis man vil vores konomisupporter der er revisor har v ret p introkursus i tre timer nu er han helt fortrolig med systemet
6653591 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6653592 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6653593 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6653594 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6653595 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6653596 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6653597 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6653598 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6653599 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6653600 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6653601 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
6653602 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6653603 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6653604 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6653605 that depends on how big fannie and freddie blow up
6653606 some hit is going to come from existing preferred shareholders
6653607 theres no protection for shareholders of common or preferred shares
6653608 while some companies will probably have some writedowns i dont think theres a widespread effect on the whole industry
6653609 from the beginning of the year until the end of the year
6653610 israel is a land that hashem your god seeks out the eyes of hashem your god are always upon it from the beginning of the year until the end of the year
6653611 its unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation anz chief executive mike smith said
6653612 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers
6653613 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down he said
6653614 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6653615 danny is studying to take the exams if he is successful it is my intention to make him commissioner

6653618 by 4pm yesterday we had received dozens of responses to our ets greens org nz account this morning it is over 300 and they are still arriving faster than we can read them
6653619 as we stand here i still absolutely believe that my client is innocent
6653620 why is it that every child that comes into contact with him is broken
6653621 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children
6653622 i thought things would go the justice way but justice is fickle i guess
6653623 i honestly dont know why it went the way it did this is the first time ive heard all this stuff that the d a is putting out that is not my child
6653624 when our request was included in the draft that was winning the battle
6653625 with sen edward m kennedys persistence in getting this into the final guidelines weve now won the war
6653626 what we thought was missing was kind of a street level understanding of how public safety works
6653627 i could run a marathon in heels and wake up the next day and run another one
6653628 speaking from many years of experience people are not going to slow down for a flag man as they would for a police officer
6653629 in order for this to be effective the state government needs to take a hard look at the prevailing wage law
6653630 until that is rectified i dont think it will have any real effect
6653631 with the prevailing wage taken into account we believe there will be substantial significant savings over a period of time with civilian flaggers
6653632 in general these regulations were intended to strike a thoughtful balance that preserves public safety while at the same time seeking cost savings
6653633 its hard to put a price tag on public safety
6653634 ultimately for a few dollars more an hour you get a police officer instead of flag man
6653635 a lot of people have talked about this in theory for some time but it was fascinating to actually identify the chemicals
6653636 our hope is that by changing the sequence we can get sensors that respond differently to chemicals they are exposed to
6653637 out of dozens and dozens of other signals that are floating around
6653638 doesnt know in advance what it is going to encounter
6653639 it doesnt matter if they were or werent involved in an attack today yesterday or on sept 11 2001 we seek out terrorists and we will give them the option to be captured or killed or possibly flee
6653640 we have no information allowing us to consider that french soldiers were killed under fire of nato planes
6653641 people are finally realizing that this russian situation has the potential to be bad for a very long time
6653642 the russians have shown evidence that theyre willing to cut off energy supplies to advance their aims there is concern that they are now going to be much more assertive in that area
6653643 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6653644 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6653645 the slide in the dollar has taken some of the wind out of the bears sail in the energy complex
6653646 terrified of allowing western countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainable economic levels
6653647 we dont have a choice we will have to make the space
6653648 assuming they have a spot available in randolph then well have to bear the expense because there are vacancies we have to fill
6653649 we dont have the funding to run an in service training facility
6653650 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6653651 even if you have to sit together for a week
6653652 the threat that we are facing today has no precedent
6653653 our enemy lurks silently within our society this is our war
6653654 reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6653655 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6653656 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6653657 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
6653658 im big and beautiful and doing my best to keep my stress levels down so i can stay healthy
6653659 thats big not lazy not a glutton and certainly not deserving of the pompous poisonous disrespect served up daily to those of us with more bounce to the ounce
6653660 the state will feel good about itself for offering something and the person of size will end up paying 300 a year for the bad luck of having a chronic disease his her state sponsored insurance program failed to cover in an appropriate and meaningful fashion
6653661 i think we can talk about acushnet locally nationally and internationally
6653662 a promotion is a viable idea given the towns heritage and its agricultural attractions
6653663 now up to thanksgiving what we have here ill match with any other town
6653664 green tourism tourism related to the outdoors apples peaches cider pumpkins think about the agrarian roots of the town the things that townspeople have remained tied to lets promote them lets explore that history include acushnet in new and creative ways
6653665 if people are noisy enough im hopeful well be called back into session
6653666 if 21 or more members say to senate president therese murray that we want to come back in session its going to get done
6653667 i dont want to point fingers but somebody should be fired over it if they cant answer the question why
6653668 first and foremost we would have to see legislation we havent seen anything in detail we could act on
6653669 our financial aid people sensed this coming for a while they were counseling students and parents and preparing them that this might not be an option
6653670 in the past they were a bread and butter loan option one of the mainstays of state opportunities it was a popular and useful lending product but i think everyone scrambled early this year unless we get flooded the day before school starts so far it hasnt been a huge issue
6653671 we were already on top of that by the end of spring weve worked with most students counseling them on different loan programs
6653672 if a kid has the opportunity to get into a four year university there should never be a time when finance prevents it if anyone says we in the commonwealth cant afford it theyre not telling the truth

6653686 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
6653687 all things to all people so i may by all means save some
6653688 dont believe her i watch her every day she doesnt live like she is telling you
6653689 the purpose of the blog is to have real conversations with the curriculums end users the teachers
6653690 my posts arent earth shattering they are based on the lesson in the study materials for that week im not re teaching the lesson but sharing personal stories of what god has been teaching me that relates to that weeks lesson
6653691 coming from the outside lifeway world i know what it is like to have no personal connection with lifeway
6653692 on the blog i hope i come across as being authentic while building credibility by putting myself out there
6653693 we used a few short term bible studies first from threads then migrated to lifematters
6653694 i visit the threads website often just for information and articles about teaching young adults and i just accidentally found this particular blog now that ive found it i rely on it each week
6653695 it makes me feel better to have another piece of material to pull from another example or illustration to talk about
6653696 sometimes i read the whole blog word for word to the class other times i just paraphrase or work it into my normal teaching
6653697 i e mail my class about twice a week with tidbits of information about the lesson or just life and i frequently use the blog material or parts of it in my e mail i like that its real life stuff that these young people can relate to even me at 40 something years old
6653698 this is the third quarter we are using the material and our study sessions have become ripe with meaningful discussions and connecting gods word to our young adults everyday lives
6653699 i check it out weekly to see what insights have been added regarding that weeks bible study
6653700 it gives some unique insight as i prepare for each weeks bible study the comments oftentimes clarify what it is god really wants us to get out of the material for that week
6653701 i like most the interaction between other users of lifematters and the editor who posts on the blog
6653702 it is great to see how god is working with people involved in the study and how that interacts with the people who designed and wrote the material
6653703 first and foremost the blog helps explain the very complex set of products services and events that make up the lifeway worship project
6653704 second it aggregates worship talk on the web pointing people to posts on other blogs and news sites regarding worship
6653705 the intent is to actively demonstrate that our section of lifeway isnt only interested in making resources
6653706 were interested in the dialogue that is occurring about the practice and theology of worship in the 21st century
6653707 the benefit of the blog is keeping the church informed about trends and preserving the integrity of worship in a changing world
6653708 the result is an informed group of worship leadership that can take new ideas and apply them to their congregations to equip their worshippers and ultimately grow the kingdom of god
6653709 we give tips on how to improve your marriage offer movie reviews provide updates on lifeways marriage events information on marriage resources to use in small group settings as well as experiential thoughts and research
6653710 i think people gravitate toward this type of interaction because its a different form of interaction its real and authentic
6653711 sharing what god is revealing to you about himself and discussing cultural insights into things that are happening currently in the world around you is something everyone can participate in
6653712 yesterday afternoon we noticed more new movement in the slip and further fracturing then this morning a local resident heard a loud noise at about 6 30am

6653727 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6653728 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6653729 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6653730 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6653731 we anticipate staying as long as there is need and helping to set up the economy because its very important that the economy begins to take on its normal aspects but it depends on our ability to do full assessments throughout georgia

6653740 things change over the course of time and changed for the better
6653741 one thing was the rule of female sports you dont have to be best friends thats a big statement
6653742 theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves
6653743 by saying what i said i put a lot of pressure on myself right
6653744 we were very sure about it we dominated but we didnt make it
6653745 it is a very hard moment i am asking myself what happened
6653746 the geographic location drove the story and the characters came after it
6653747 right now the irony is that its revitalization thats getting everybodys attention the real estate has gone through the roof as opposed to what you saw in the early 1990s when it was probably the most dangerous area of manhattan in terms of crime drugs and violence giulianis law and order administration came in and real estate needed a place to go nothing defeats crime like real estate so whenever people read about the lower east side now its about this fabulous little restaurant or how many millions this small pied a terre is going for but you still have the chinese and the housing project life the black and hispanic culture and the orthodox jews who are a world unto themselves
6653748 i wanted to portray this eternal high low disparity that exists here
6653749 you might think this is disingenuous but i never thought of myself as a mystery writer or a thriller writer or any sort of genre writer i have a very complicated landscape but ive discovered that if i follow the course of an investigation its a very convenient horse to ride because the natural progression of an investigation will take you into all the worlds you want to touch in a very organized way i dont even care who did it its an excuse to get into the world i would rather say who did it in the first sentence and get it out of the way there are so many dead ends in this book so many things that go nowhere this thing solves itself almost out of spite
6653750 i dont consciously sit down to write about race or immigration
6653751 the stories that pop up lean towards these things because theyre on my mind so when i come up with ideas for books my mind gravitates towards stories that involve issues like race and class and the elements of urban america theres a lot of stuff like illegal immigration issues or whether were getting better or worse racially or whats happening to the middle class that i dont even fully explore or that frankly i dont care about in a bald way but somehow when something happens it all gels in a way that for me is very compelling without being lecture ish or full of conjecture
6653752 being from an immigrant background like most people in new york city this is where my family started out as did the family of everybody i grew up with we came from eastern european jews people fleeing european poverty kind of spilled off the boat into the lower east side whether they were jewish or catholic or whatever and then worked their way up and out from there over the generations so its kind of like the mother land
6653753 melting pot is such a pie in the sky phrase but if your father was making 4 000 bucks in 1950 they put you in the parkside projects whether you were black white chinese or a holocaust survivor i wasnt thinking of anybody as a character of course extreme behaviour could be exotic but the fact that somebody was a particular race was like so what but you also experience that dividing out suddenly youre nine and you notice that everybody is gravitating to their side of the divide i experienced growing into a race awareness that you dont have when youre little but some people never had that racial mix or separation to begin with
6653754 the best screenwriter would make a terrible novelist and would write the most superficial novel
6653755 the only time it trips me up as a screenwriter is when i start to rely too heavily on dialogue i like for people to talk but as soon as you watch a movie and its great you realize there are maybe 300 words of dialogue a movie isnt about who says what thats a play a screenplay is 120 words of story that you bang you and its all two dimensional books are four dimensional
6653756 when i was younger i used to listen to certain stuff to get in the mood be it old doo wop records or sixties rock n roll
6653757 its funny though for all the cultures and types of people living here i didnt listen to a single note of anything for lush life either im growing up or i have a harder time concentrating
6653758 i knew it was a billy strayhorn tune but i never read the lyrics
6653759 i didnt know it was about a bunch of old drunk ladies i never realized it was about one of that old third avenue lost weekend bars when i finished the book i downloaded all these old versions of the song and went oh no i just like the phrase because i was trying to write about the variety of cultures here i dont want to sound like the united nations but this place is like a riot of people so i was thinking of the word lush like you have loco weed next to american beauties next to crabgrass and redwood trees i didnt realize it meant bombed so i guess i kind of blew the title

6653774 how in the world can i justify even thinking about spending money on such a trivial item when the weight of others suffering pain and poverty cries out all around me
6653775 there is one thing i will never forget mother teresas feet each morning in mass i would stare at them i wondered if she had contracted leprosy but i wasnt going to ask of course one day a sister said to us have you noticed her feet we nodded curious she said her feet are deformed because we get just enough donated shoes for everyone and mother does not want anyone to get stuck with the worst pair so she digs through and finds them and years of doing that have deformed her feet years of loving her neighbor as herself deformed her feet
6653776 the reason for the collapse of world trade centre 7 is no longer a mystery
6653777 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6653778 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
6653779 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
6653780 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
6653781 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in
6653782 and how about the men why not bring in compulsory lycra bike pants instead of the baggy shorts many men wear currently
6653783 the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression

6653792 spansions expanded agreement with smic for leading edge mirrorbit production is a strategic move to increase spansions ability to serve our customer base with a richer range of solutions
6653793 the deepening of our relationship with smic also further expands our presence in china one of the fastest growing markets for flash memory
6653794 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin
6653795 that was a scene that we witnessed and then they towed the whale behind their national parks and wildlife boat it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat
6653796 that was the best way it could have been done
6653797 its a funny thing you dont know what you have until you have it everyone who saw the beginning the interviews that we had done they said whats the story whats the story i said you know i dont know the story i just find her captivating and im just going to keep working on it and i cant give you a reason except now at the end of it i can she exhibits life to its fullest you know and shes not a perfect person by any means she definitely has her faults but i like the fact that she just keeps moving through it all
6653798 you have to stop i mean mimi continues to work constantly
6653799 you have to learn how to stop because these people keep going and keep creating
6653800 and i think the hardest part for me was getting her to turn it off and the only way i did that was to keep the camera going when she didnt really think it was going
6653801 as my children have been growing up all these women including my own mom were not able to be there for their children in the way that the children felt they needed their mother to be there i think it helped me to understand and have a little bit of compassion for these people because i learned myself that once you become a mother you do have a lot more compassion for your own mothering
6653802 yeah i know im off center with these children i wanted them to be a little graceful theyre so earthbound they dont see the thread grace thats what it is you dance as you walk through life as you sail through life and furthermore it heightens your living as of the moment if you dont dance for heavens sake you can not aspire you do not lift up from this earth

6653820 many native texas plants like certain grasses tend to not look so good in 4 inch or 1 gallon pots at the nursery
6653821 most people dont want their garden to stick out as the only house on the block that looks radically different
6653822 my projects need to weave nicely into the residential style of austin
6653823 they have to be conventionally attractive and recognizable as a garden in the sense of their particular neighborhood
6653824 i used to hide behind the needs and desires of my clients in the interest of serving them
6653825 but now my starting point is the place the clients bought their property for a reason its up to me to uncover that reason and reveal it
6653826 sometimes it seems like people think that anything that was originally on their property must be vulgar or undesirable and needs to be replaced with something new
6653827 i find that as you focus your lens on the beauty of the local it becomes so much more potent
6653828 the fact that people often want the more exotic imported items a stone brought in from china can be cheaper to buy even with the shipping costs
6653829 it can be a challenge to keep your principles in the face of budget concerns
6653830 i find my clients really want to engage in a more meaningful way they want to think holistically about their property
6653831 ten years or so ago unless people were approaching a building project with a totally moral or ethical commitment they wouldnt have given the idea of green design a second thought
6653832 now we are in a completely different environment where everyone is thinking of these issues to some degree
6653833 they dont always know how to do it but they want to do things differently
6653834 people shouldnt have to make a choice between beauty and sustainability
6653835 our work is designed so that i am able to say to our clients during a presentation oh and by the way its also sustainable

6653839 however we prefer entry level online casino job applicants to be under 40 years of age
6653840 and we realize that as a result we provide new online casino business hirees with substantial benefits to stay onboard and grow their career with us
6653841 we believe this time gives us an opportunity to evaluate new hires and decide if we made the right decision in offering them work if they dont pass this temporary evaluation period we offer the job to anyone on our waiting list
6653842 with the recent boom in the online casino market were looking to hire 100 new employees in a range of different jobs
6653843 this new program has really helped our online casino company
6653844 and it also allows us to see what other firms are offering to new job applicants this helps get an edge on the competition and strengthens our human capital greatly
6653845 this test is not meant to scare off prospective hirees
6653846 but we want to see how they can apply the skills they have to the real life needs of written communication and critical thinking
6653847 its important for all our top hires to know individuals within the industry and individuals within our company this makes marketing and sales work much easier and more efficient so if your uncle bob at a major online casino firm offers you a job youre advised to take it
6653848 our hr department is by far the largest unit at geisel truslow inc
6653849 and rightly so with stock par values increasing by the month we need more and more hirees to satisfy our growing corportate needs

6653851 i would solve a lot of literary problems just thinking about a character in the subway where you cant do anything anyway
6653852 we are all excited for the game and we are anxious to play someone besides ourselves
6653853 player for player we are probably more talented than we have been in previous years but how those mesh together that remains to be seen but if i had to go on early indications i think we have got the talent to compete with anybody
6653854 the exciting thing is that lindsay parlee showed that she can step in and had a great year last year its just that she played behind a player of brynns caliber stephanie phillips comes from a program that is used to winning and being on a big stage so that competition has been fun to watch
6653855 wtf search for your own worth you want to know who you are you taking usamo just for the sake of taking it haha you are joking right
6653856 when i look in the mirror do i like what i see
6653857 what would i think of myself if i were someone else looking at who i am right now
6653858 its in that future that machines from intel will surpass human intelligence
6653859 and progress in next hundred years will be more like the progress of last 20 000 years of human history because of technology
6653860 well need new materials to improve transistor performance and new technologies like tri gate transistors trigate gives you more power lower leakage and better density
6653861 cmos will be the platform of the processor and then well have other things on top of that
6653862 wireless radios dont work together in fact they fight each other

6653895 die chinesische f hrung hat entgegen aller hoffnungen die olympische idee schamlos verraten entsetzt mussten wir mit ansehen wie w hrend der spiele alle internationalen standards der presse und meinungsfreiheit missachtet wurden
6653896 aber schlimmer als den aktivisten und journalisten von deren festnahme wir erfahren haben ergeht es den menschen in tibet deren schicksal weitgehend vor der welt verborgen wird dies waren wahre trauerspiele f r die freiheit
6653897 die welt darf deshalb auch nach den olympischen spielen die augen nicht verschlie en china muss endlich eine friedliche l sung f r tibet suchen und in einen konstruktiven dialog mit dem dalai lama treten darauf muss auch die bundesregierung immer wieder dr ngen

6653922 john mccain has been in the public eye for 25 years
6653923 this government is determined to support veterans and ex serving personnel who may suffer psychologically as a result of their service
6653924 however to do so we need a better understanding of the incidence and characteristics of suicide amongst this community
6653925 we know that war service can have both physical and mental impact on the lives of service personnel
6653926 physical impairment can be obvious psychological injury is less so
6653927 seriawan juga sering disebut ulcer luka karena merupakan peradangan di rongga mulut yang menimbulkan luka atau lesi
6653928 yang harus diwaspadai adalah kalau sudah berminggu minggu tapi seriawan tidak kunjung sembuh sebab kemungkinannya bisa mengarah pada gejala oral cancer
6653929 secara awam mungkin kita melihat semua bentuk seriawan sama saja cuma bintik putih biasa padahal kalau diperiksa bisa macam macam hasil diagnosisnya seriawan yang tak kunjung sembuh bisa dicurigai ke arah keganasan misalkan leukoplakia yang bisa merupakan para kanker dan dapat berkembang menjadi kanker
6653930 jadi kita patut berhati hati kalau menderita seriawan yang tidak sembuh juga terutama jika terjadi di area lidah

6653932 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
6653933 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6653934 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6653935 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6653936 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration

6653941 we conscientious objectors planned to go to prison together but the army has apparently learned its lesson and arrested udi as a preemptive measure
6653942 i cannot take part in the activities of an occupying army that regularly violates human rights as an israeli citizen and as a drafted teenager i feel that it is my duty to refuse to enter the circle of blood and add fuel to the fire of hatred that is raging in our fields
6653943 i refuse to join an army so as not to support the occupation and other acts that go against my most basic principles human rights democracy and every mans social responsibility towards his fellow man
6653944 deliberate attempt on the armys part to prevent our voices from being heard we were surprised by how quickly udi was arrested but we were prepared for such a scenario and knew that this was a price we were willing to pay
6653945 fortunately people are beginning to realize that the army is not a sacred cow and enlisting in it is not a must
6653946 if more and more people voice their objection to the occupation the governments policy will have to follow suit
6653947 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6653948 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6653949 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6653950 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6653951 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well

6653970 thats what they do every night and thats exactly the kind of show i want to put on for folks our show tends to have a lot of energy not a lot of ballads

6653977 garth brooks is another huge influence of mine he made me get how music could be magic he really made me see how it could touch folks lives
6653978 we will have more patrol officers out and will be trying to hit the school areas a little more heavily in the mornings and when the kids get out of school to try to make it safer but if we can educated the kids remind them i know its hard to remind a 5th and 6th grader since they know everything but try to remind the kids to also be safe

6653982 one of the things that make linux work as a development project is the fact that linus torvalds who is the final decision maker on the release of the kernel works at a place that is not one of the competitors that collaborates on the project
6653983 everyone just has a different approach and they cant agree on just one its really just an issue of discipline within the industry and the community

6653985 were getting pretty close to the zero balance in the old checkbook and for the next year with the cost of running the pool and stuff we need to keep it open and our programs to keep going
6653986 were just asking the farmers to donate a few bushels off the combine put it into our truck and in return from us we will deliver some burgers chips cookies and pop out to their field
6653987 farmers started calling and we got our first pick up on monday evening and tonight we have three other farmers to pick up and some bushels in the field and feed them supper we give the wives a break from cooking
6653988 its just for the park i dont want to see it move backwards and my daughter works there and my boy goes there swims there quite a little

6653997 are you willing to come from georgia and pick me up here
6653998 a mans steps are of the lord how then can a man understand his own way

6654000 however when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he will not speak on his own authority but whatever he hears he will speak and he will tell you things to come
6654001 these things i have spoken to you that in me you may have peace in the world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
6654002 peace i leave with you my peace i give to you not as the world gives do i give to you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid
6654003 but seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added to you

6654006 the first real stereo 3 d for the home will be via blu ray and for that you need a standard format
6654007 if everything goes perfectly this could happen in 2010 or 2011 but it never goes like that
6654008 what we expected to find is that the migration to ipv6 is slow
6654009 i dont think youd find anyone that expected there to be a significant ramp up in ipv6 usage what was surprising in what we found is that there is no migration
6654010 we saw a flat proportion of ipv4 to ipv6 over the course of the year
6654011 so although in aggregate ipv6 did grow its growing at about the same level that general internet traffic is growing
6654012 we have some monitoring in asia but we would like to see more there obviously iekel johnson admitted
6654013 its not quite as comprehensive as the european and north american measurements

6654032 the two new cyber shot phones that we have announced today share certain characteristics both phones place ease of use and best in class picture quality at the heart of their designs
6654033 yet both appeal to different audiences one is engineered to let you take more pictures in more places and the other is designed to look as stunning as the pictures it takes
6654034 our politics have become so embedded and so partisan with so many special interests that they require a massive effort from the public telling them we want something done

6654043 the little harp should bear a painting thats a copy of my painting on this big harp
6654044 giving popular schools the freedom to expand does not mean they will do so to the extent that a schools position in the league tables depends on the attainment of its intake schools may be unwilling to increase and potentially to dilute the quality of their student body
6654045 everyone knows that there is a strong association between social class and achievement and that this association works very much to the disadvantage of economically disadvantaged students
6654046 the california research however had the virtue of demonstrating that this disadvantage was exaggerated as school size increased
6654047 acts of mass murder intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat
6654048 will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbour them
6654049 to strike at the very heart of our national security system and our very democratic process
6654050 it is part of the argument that the u s can do whatever it wishes to another country but if that country dares to protect itself or tries to interfere with the process such as the miami five trying to stop terrorist attacks against their homeland then the us will deal with them most severely
6654051 protect our homeland and our friends and allies from ballistic missile attack
6654052 valid under venezuelas constitution as with any tool of democracy it depends how it is used
6654053 you will be more than guaranteed in the hands of the republic and you know the banking sector of venezuela is one of the most solid in the world
6654054 riot police used tear gas as they blocked hundreds of venezuelans protesting what they call new moves by president chavez to concentrate his power
6654055 blacklists barring key opposition candidates from elections and socialist decrees destroying whats left of their democracy
6654056 is acceptable in accordance with the laws that are given for reasons of general interest for the safety of others of society and for the common good in accordance with the provisions of articles 30 and 32 2 of the american convention on human rights this requirement is fully compatible with the provisions of articles 19 and 156 of the national constitution

6654058 support the right of the venezuelan people to determine their own future free from external intervention
6654059 conducted strictly on legal and administrative grounds carried out as part of the constitutional and legal obligations of the office of the comptroller general taken following
6654060 is using his decree powers to enact a set of socialist inspired measures that seem based on a package of constitutional changes
6654061 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
6654062 formalize socialist inspired policies on the margins of the formal economy like a measure declaring barter a legitimate system of payment
6654063 the coming regional elections have the potential to erode the presidents power base
6654064 to set up neighborhood based militias state control over agriculture
6654065 chavez enact ing aggressive new laws with an iron fist increasing the states power over the economy ahead of key regional elections
6654066 drive to create a socialist state significantly increase his power and resemble proposals included in a constitutional reform narrowly rejected by voters in a december referendum
6654067 up in arms over a raft of decree laws they say replicate constitutional reforms
6654068 typical of mr chavezs authoritarian streak and will let him expropriate private property without the need for the ans approval
6654069 ambitious decrees which formalize the creation of a popular militia and further consolidate state control over key areas of the economy such as agriculture and tourism
6654070 bypass ing congress in making laws and being back on the offensive after suffering a humiliating defeat in december that might have let him stay in power for life
6654071 accusations that mr chavez is evading the will of the people
6654072 we are in the presence of a dictatorial government which has given a coup detat to the constitution here we have no constitution no law and the president does exactly what he wants
6654073 everything hes doing is related to the upcoming election and its hard to imagine he doesnt see this as important in his efforts to keep power
6654074 put ting down all challengers to his power forcibly if necessary
6654075 get in the way of mr chavezs caudillo aspirations at your peril
6654076 forces of reaction with the aim of restoring the bourgeois system
6654077 we need order in our country the meetings in prague i e public discussions if they continue will have a negative effect on the democratisation process
6654078 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6654079 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people
6654080 the average household has its tv on for eight hours and 14 minutes daily thats a record
6654081 at some schools they choose to allow the child to eat and the school pays for the meal in other situations the school says no we cant afford to pay for that meal you will get an alternative meal that we provide to them which is a cheese sandwich and a carton of milk or in many situations at the high school level if you dont have money you dont eat that day
6654082 i dont know how kids could sit at school and learn if theyre not eating breakfast and lunch
6654083 you know so often you hear something on the news and you wish you could do something about it but its so far away or whatever the circumstances are you cant do anything but this i knew right away this was something i could do something about
6654084 and we have to be pretty aggressive at approaching parents and drawing them in and waving the forms and saying have you filled this out yet and if not theyre happy to fill it out because its much easier for them to just fill it out there than have to then remember to do it and then mail it in
6654085 the initial information went out with the school calendar that was mailed to the homes the last week of july so we have seen a very good response to that mailing of the applications
6654086 the parents have multiple issues that theyre dealing with and some parents dont know that its really as simple as filling out the form some people think its already been done because they did it last year and they dont realize they have to turn in the form every single year some people have literacy issues or children are living in more than one home there are a lot of different things that are happening
6654087 the only thing you could host that is bigger is the olympics
6654088 i am happy for myself but i am more happy for the players they deserve it its a players dream theyve worked hard for three or four years and cooperated well its not only these 12 players we had to cut players who have worked very hard so id like to celebrate with them as well

6654096 milwaukees libraries are dynamic they offer programs that meet the needs of the people where they are and although were not the only one to close a third or a fourth or any percentage of the libraries doesnt make sense we wouldnt stop collecting garbage or we wouldnt turn off sewer service or any other vital service why would we restrict library service
6654097 the little children that we saw when we came in here if they had to go downtown to access library services thatd be a hardship some of them were kind of small i didnt notice if any of them were on bicycles but i have seen kids ride their bikes to the library
6654098 we are looking at different staffing levels in libraries for example based on relative needs of the population and we certainly understand that libraries provide an important alternative for your people and the reason its on the table quite frankly is because there just isnt a lot of other positive alternatives to consider

6654148 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6654149 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6654150 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6654151 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6654152 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6654153 ball high is on the right track we have work to do no doubt but overall the staff is doing a good job

6654159 but barack obama had a crucial advantage over his rivals this year the support of the national media especially the three broadcast networks
6654160 at every step of his national political career network reporters showered the illinois senator with glowing media coverage building him up as a political celebrity and exhibiting little interest in investigating his past associations or exploring the controversies that could have threatened his campaign
6654161 when it mattered most as he debuted on the national scene
6654162 this study proves emphatically and without question that the big three networks had a horse in this years democratic primary race
6654163 were trying to establish who is the beneficiary of the funds raised at the dinner
6654164 we learned that quite some hundreds of millions of naira were raised
6654165 the dinner concert held on august 11 was a relaxed atmosphere designed to sensitise and mobilise africans worldwide and other eligible u s citizens to register and vote instead of passively watching history be made

6654176 now operate in drug trafficking kidnapping and money laundering among other things with no central control nor any one gang dominating in any of the criminal activities that is why kidnapping has grown more competitive with kidnappers using much more violence against each other and against the victims in a bid to gain territory markets or dominance

6654219 protest pens meant to segregate demonstrations a system that has been set in place to deflect criticism about the lack of freedom to protest the lack of freedom of assembly and demonstration in china
6654220 federal and local authorities are girding for huge protests mammoth traffic tie ups and civil disturbances
6654221 the city said they couldnt disclose information because the secret service wouldnt tell the city their plans but once we filed suit suddenly the started releasing information then the second phase of the suit was to challenge the constitutionality of the security arrangements which the judge of course upheld
6654222 mark cohen testified that the security conditions around the dnc will make demonstrators look like animals in a cage and that the delegates wont hear them he also said that the public demonstration zone is blocked by a media tent and other structures that limit sight and sound access to the delegates it is not the image of fellow citizens but rather prisoners in a cage with no clear connection to the purpose of their being there cohen said
6654223 before the trial started members of recreate 68 staged a quiet protest outside the u s district courthouse against the secret service and the city while wearing orange jail jumpsuits with the words dissent is not a crime yet they also placed silver duct tape over their mouths

6654231 the secret service the pentagon the federal bureau of investigation and scores of police departments are moving thousands of agents analysts officers and employees to denver for the aug 25 28 convention they will operate through a complex hierarchy of command centers steering committees and protocols to respond to disruptions the denver police department will nearly double in size according to federal officials involved in the planning the city is bringing in nearly 1 500 police officers from communities throughout colorado and beyond even inviting an eight person mounted unit from cheyenne wy
6654232 ignoring a city prohibition against the collection of first amendment related intelligence the denver police developed files on 208 organizations and 3 200 individuals the department appears to have continued its surveillance until the fall of 2002 despite the aclu lawsuit monitored groups included the american friends service committee a pacifist quaker group amnesty international and many others with no history of criminal activity documents obtained by the aclu describe how police intercepted e mails recorded the license plate numbers of vehicles at demonstrations and infiltrated advocacy group meetings
6654233 federal and state law enforcement officials in colorado plan to increase intelligence operations during the democratic national convention in denver and run a fusion center where intelligence analysts will collect and analyze reports of suspicious activity civil rights advocates fear the fusion center could enable unwarranted spying on protesters exercising their first amendment rights at the convention
6654234 these centers have very robust police powers and domestic intelligence collecting powers and what weve seen in the past is that when police agencies are given secret powers to spy they abuse those powers and where there is very unclear line of accountability the chances of something bad happening under that system were very high
6654235 meant to facilitate communications between federal state and local law enforcement agencies to share information about quote unquote suspicious activities which can include taking pictures or taking notes the definition is very broad when its defined by them
6654236 one of the precursor behaviors to terrorism thats identified in the order is taking video and we put in our report a couple of instances where people taking video were stopped by police officers simply for taking pictures or video and in some cases particularly where theyre taking photographs or video of police it actually resulted in arrests

6654293 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6654294 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6654295 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to
6654296 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6654297 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6654298 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6654299 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base

6654308 were in favor of dan and want dan to be elected but if we appoint a republican who is running for office in the perceptions of minds it creates unfairness and that doesnt help our candidate

6654342 wenige schaffen es dem druck zu widerstehen dem gruppendruck dem druck der autorit t faszinierend finde ich dass wir nie vorhersagen k nnen wer das sein wird ein wichtiger faktor ist das akzeptierte sozialverhalten in der gruppe was tun die anderen f r was wird man belohnt

6654346 the unprecedented importation of old computers into africa from developed countries to satisfy information technology need has resulted in electronic waste that adds to environmental pollution
6654347 i appeal on developed countries not to use africa as a dumping site for computers
6654348 this is the situation in most african cities where computer villages for selling old imported computers especially laptops are springing up

6654420 apart from their original purpose the unions must now learn to act deliberately as organizing centers of the working class in the broad interest of its complete emancipation they must aid every social and political movement tending in that direction considering themselves as acting as the champions of the whole working class they cannot fail to enlist the non society men the unorganized fg into their ranks they must look carefully after the interests of the worst paid trades such as agricultural laborers rendered powerless by exceptional circumstances they must convince the world at large that their efforts far from being narrow and selfish aim at the emancipation of the downtrodden millions

6654433 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6654434 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6654435 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6654436 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6654437 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

6654439 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

6654498 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6654499 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6654500 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6654501 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6654502 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6654503 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6654504 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6654505 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6654506 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6654507 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6654508 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6654509 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6654510 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6654511 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6654512 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6654513 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6654514 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6654515 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6654516 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6654517 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

6654521 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6654522 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6654523 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6654524 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6654525 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6654526 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6654527 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6654528 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6654529 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6654530 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6654531 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6654532 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6654533 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6654534 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6654535 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6654538 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6654539 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6654540 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6654541 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6654542 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6654543 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6654544 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6654545 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6654546 the government will acquire another 600 acres in future for the next phases

6654548 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6654549 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6654550 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6654551 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6654552 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6654553 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6654554 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6654555 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6654556 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6654557 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6654558 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6654559 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

6654561 i rode a metra train today and it was overcrowded and everyone was inconvenienced
6654562 as a board im not sure this is the right time to do this
6654563 theres no question in my mind we need additional office space but before going forward with a boardroom it ought to be as plain and simple and inexpensive as can be
6654564 hey our guest blog is due for the stiletto gang what should we write about
6654565 you cant be blank were writers creativity is supposed to flow from us
6654566 yeah well my flowing days are long gone i got nothing
6654567 except were not famous well perhaps less obscure were almost recognizable in the vast stygian swamp of authors and rich lets not go there too depressing
6654568 stygian swamps huh you like those murky metaphors okay there is a nancy drew thread happening on the site we could talk about that
6654569 es importante que en el congreso discutamos sobre las distintas implicancias de la industria del salm n ya que es un tema de inter s p blico que tiene altos impactos en la poblaci n
6654570 en chile se usan al menos 170 veces m s antibi ticos que en noruega primer productor del mundo el uso excesivo de estas sustancias debe ser limitado por una nueva normativa que fije los tipos y cantidades que se pueden usar para evitar los efectos nocivos que causan actualmente las buenas pr cticas pueden ser complementarias a las regulaciones pero en ning n caso reemplazan a una necesaria y nueva normativa
6654571 actualmente hay suficiente evidencia cient fica que muestra aumento de resistencia a los antibi ticos en las bacterias lo que en consecuencia disminuye su eficacia antibacteriana la resistencia a los antimicrobianos en la acuicultura debiera ser una prioridad en materia de investigaci n cient fica la oms ha calificado a este problema como una crisis a nivel mundial
6654572 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6654573 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6654574 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6654575 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6654576 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6654577 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6654578 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6654579 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6654580 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6654581 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6654582 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6654583 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6654584 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6654585 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6654586 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6654587 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6654588 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6654589 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6654590 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6654591 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6654592 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6654593 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6654594 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6654595 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6654596 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6654597 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6654598 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6654599 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6654600 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6654601 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6654602 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6654603 stoppa pirate bay fr n att sprida bandningar av os invigningen
6654604 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6654605 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6654606 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6654607 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6654608 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6654609 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6654610 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6654611 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6654612 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6654613 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6654614 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6654615 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6654616 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6654617 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6654618 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6654619 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6654620 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6654621 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6654622 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6654623 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market
6654624 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6654625 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market
6654626 all of it was spent on making her as big as she is now
6654627 take a bow was bought through her money the video was created with her money and so is her most recent video and single disturbia the label didnt even want to pay a dime for anything close to 750 000 was spent on those two songs alone and now she expects to see money in her account
6654628 her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he marc knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it
6654629 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6654630 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6654631 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6654632 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6654633 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6654634 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6654635 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6654636 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6654637 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6654638 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6654639 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6654640 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6654641 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6654642 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6654643 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6654644 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6654645 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6654646 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6654647 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6654648 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6654649 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6654650 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6654651 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6654652 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6654653 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6654654 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6654655 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6654656 ach ich habe mir so gew nscht du ziehst mir zuliebe das kleine schwarze an
6654657 my sister in law has eyes like that and shes black
6654658 yeah she just had twins one of them came out black and the other came out white
6654659 this is my sister in law you know what im saying shes married to my brother obviously hes black
6654660 oh right but thats weird that she would have a white baby
6654661 not really her momma was white so i guess it came down that way but it is strange to see them together a little black baby with dark eyes and dark skin and a little white baby with brown hair and green eyes
6654662 stanley i think i hear my cell phone ringing gotta catch that call
6654663 wie immer die welt entstanden ist wenn sie da ist bleibt nur die evolution um ihre komplexit t zu garantieren
6654664 wer heute noch glaubt dass sportliche h chstleistungen allein durch neue trainingsmethoden und fettarme milch m glich sind der glaubt wohl auch noch an den weihnachtsmann
6654665 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6654666 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6654667 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6654668 you train your whole life and you want to win you dont expect to lose
6654669 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do
6654670 with shea smith its hes been here for a while i think it helps being a senior at the academy i just think you figure out a little bit the daily routine with academics with things that you have to do within your squadron and i think hes got a real good grasp of what we do offensively eric runs quite well and you can see hes got some flashes of being able to do some things a little bit more dynamic
6654671 we have an ongoing process of writing down and raising fresh capital that is going to be demanding for a very very long time
6654672 consumers are borrowed to the hilt and the banking sector is no longer able to provide the consumer with credit unless they want to see a major collapse in the financial sector the government will have to fund the difference and borrow a lot more
6654673 el precio del acero deber a normalizarse a mediano plazo
6654674 a mediano plazo veo una normalizaci n de precios en el acero pero de ninguna manera vamos a volver a valores comparables a lo que vimos en el pasado tales como 400 500 o 600 d lares
6654675 su crecimiento determinar el destino del mercado en las pr ximas d cadas
6654676 the ruling is basically giving processors giving those who deal with providing fresh or minimally processed spinach or lettuce to consumers an additional tool another technology to reduce the level of microorganisms that are of concern
6654677 having irradiation of foods provides a disincentive for animal factories and other food production facilities to clean up their act
6654678 its a good initial first step for products that have been considered high risk
6654679 my mom couldnt control me i had so much energy that my parents decided to take me to this school
6654680 she is the real deal and she is wonderful to work with
6654681 we are a more technically driven school at state street she brings it exactly where ive always wanted it to go
6654682 most kids they just do it for fun but even if you do it for fun i think its important that you know what youre doing and that you know it well
6654683 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6654684 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6654685 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6654686 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6654687 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6654688 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6654689 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6654690 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6654691 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6654692 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6654693 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6654694 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6654695 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6654696 well ekg test was on your chart you mustve had one
6654697 i do need a gas modulator in my trunk otherwise my brakes will snap fair enough
6654698 oh you dont remember when we gave you triple bypass surgery
6654699 surely you remember when you got the bionic legs youve been walking with for the past four months
6654700 i dont plan on buying anything until i know exactly what i need
6654701 it really acts as a tax break for back to school and other clothes
6654702 obviously the economy is so difficult and prices seem to be going up in food and fuel i can imagine people would have to cut back
6654703 i am honored to have the opportunity to address the democratic convention and speak to my vision to partner with senator obama and make washington work for working families again
6654704 oregonians are ready for the kind of change senator obama will bring to washington

6654910 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6654911 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6654912 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6654913 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed
6654914 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6654915 i thought the scores werent going to be as low
6654916 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6654917 there are tournaments where ill shoot 6 or 7 under and thats as good as i can play and the winner is 21 under and im thinking how did they do that
6654918 i know its difficult out there and the rough is tough but that was just bad play
6654919 when he gets hot he does do some crazy stuff
6654920 if you drive the ball well you have some birdie chances and if you dont you struggle to break par

6654923 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6654924 it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now but people have got to understand that this will happen
6654925 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment
6654926 all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6654927 hi how is everybody doing today i am tommy and this is sheri
6654928 we have got about 12 to 14 properties we are going to see today we are going to try to keep moving very quickly
6654929 i had no idea that in such a nice location i could get a house for a price that is half of what it was just three years back
6654930 a lot of these foreclosures dont even have signs up saying that they are foreclosures and they are gone in a day
6654931 so its difficult to find them and when we do its hard to work with the banks to get our contracts approved so we decided that if it was that hard for us to do how hard it was for everybody else to do it
6654932 they make it very organized and its kind of fun you know to go on the buses to see all the properties
6654933 it does save me a lot of time instead of actually contacting all the agents to go through these properties
6654934 if you put it into a light where you look at this house and you say somebody used to live there and they lost their home and they lost everything its really hard
6654935 but we want to make it an enjoyable experience and fun and a great opportunity for new people to have a home themselves that maybe couldnt afford a home three years ago
6654936 its very rarely that i open us weekly and see myself in it and thats the way i like it
6654937 my parents are exactly who you think theyre very straightforward they are highly blunt they say exactly what theyre thinking in terms of their public image versus the reality at home i dont think there is that much of a divide
6654938 the line is designed off my personality and my aesthetic its feminine but with a modern twist on old hollywood
6654939 getting group of friends together and trying trying is the operative word to cook them dinner i rarely go past midnight i get up between 5 45 and 6am and ride my beach cruiser bike around the loop in central park for exercise its cathartic
6654940 im not looking to get married now i have a lot on my plate i would love to have children but i am certainly in no rush
6654941 ive had a lot of water now its just time to relax a bit
6654942 omg this is like where carrie and samantha and miranda and charlotte got cupcakes omg we have to go omg theyre open late omg
6654943 right now their lives are divided their relationship isnt on shaky ground but things definitely arent perfect
6654944 we need to talk to the people on campus that are experts that deal day to day with some of the issues that relate to alcohol and underage drinking before taking a stance on the issue
6654945 there are more than 50 studies that have been done in the states that have moved between the ages of 18 and 21 over the years
6654946 in all of them the data clearly shows that when the drinking age goes up the number of deaths and highway fatalities drop significantly across the board
6654947 what students want is only one of many issues that we have to keep in mind
6654948 as a result of the expansion of our product offerings for the current generation of consoles mad catz reached an important inflection point in the first quarter of 2008 as sales for the current generation of consoles surpassed those of the prior generation for the first time
6654949 during the first quarter mad catz also made significant progress in extending our geographic reach and product diversification by leveraging our acquisition of leading pc peripherals provider saitek
6654950 we believe we can significantly reduce sg amp a as a percentage of net sales from the levels recorded in the first quarter and we remain focused on effecting further cost management initiatives to improve our operating efficiency
6654951 consistent with our initiative to further strengthen our portfolio of globally recognized brand licenses during the first quarter mad catz entered into several agreements to align our products with some of the most popular and recognizable franchises worldwide our new manchester united liverpool and arsenal football club licenses should help leverage the increased penetration our products are gaining throughout europe while our rayman raving rabbids and petz licenses should help broaden our portfolio of products appealing to a younger demographic these recent agreements add further depth to what we consider to an impressive portfolio of brand licenses and we expect our licensed product lines to be an important driver of sales for mad catz for the upcoming holiday season and through this fiscal year
6654952 while there is still progress to be made mad catz has proven its ability to successfully execute upon its goals to gain traction on the current generation of consoles diversify its product lines expand its geographic presence and achieve improved gross margins as a result we are poised to enter the holiday season with a broad suite of products and deep portfolio of entertaining brand licenses which we believe favorably positions mad catz to capitalize upon the success of our products and the strength of the interactive entertainment industry and generate shareholder value
6654953 the dead included women and children as most of the fatalities occurred due to the incidents of houses collapsing
6654954 two girls were buried alive as their mud house fell on them

6654957 by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6654958 i guess if you think being rich is you have to make 5 million a year and you have to think about how many houses you have then you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6654959 i think uh ill have my staff get to you
6654960 i cant tell you condominiums ill have them get to you
6654961 i consider this a mistake on my part and i regret it
6654962 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses

6654973 i cant believe anyone in the republic would be crazy enough to deliberately send another programmed assassin after me especially after releasing the aforesaid assassin from prison and providing her with transportation home i think they must have a pretty shrewd notion of how elizabeth would react to that
6654974 i think mostly they picked me because im beths cousin they figured shed have to listen to a message from me and i imagine they hoped the fact that theyd given me back to her would at least tempt her to listen seriously to what they had to say
6654975 which is or is it privileged information you cant share with me
6654976 but i was specifically told i could share it with you since it also concerns you
6654977 if you dont come clean with me and quit tossing out tidbits im going to choke it out of you you do realize that dont you
6654978 home less than an hour and already threatened with physical violence
6654979 its not really a laughing matter i suppose but put most simply pritchart is using me as her messenger to suggest to beth that the two of them meet in a face to face summit to discuss a negotiated settlement
6654980 thats a very interesting offer do you think she really means it
6654981 oh i think she definitely wants to meet with beth just what she intends to offer is another matter on that front i wish youd been the one talking to her
6654982 basically she left it wide open obviously she wants a peace treaty but she didnt list any specific set of terms apparently shes willing to throw everything into the melting pot if beth will agree to negotiate with her one on one
6654983 thats a significant change from their previous stance at least as i understand it
6654984 i hate to say it but youre probably in a better position to know that than i am
6654985 ive been trying to pay more attention to politics since you tore a strip off me but its still not really a primary interest of mine
6654986 its probably a good thing you are more interested in politics and diplomacy than i am

6654995 hes in jail i have heard that they want to castrate him neuter him
6654996 those were the humans in the first habitat howard saved my life he cared for me and i brought him here to face a fate worse than death
6654997 a male might see it like that i suppose well wed better spring him then hes good at making friends i had a call from his mistress a few minutes ago which is why i knew where he was she wanted me to intervene because he has unique genetic material its true enough but she didnt like it when i pointed out that all i could justify was a few cc of cell sample her comments on my suggestion that she collect a sperm sample and freeze it were an education to me that girl can swear
6654998 and then i must try to move as fast as possible to rescue abret and then we can return to our spacecraft and selna are you still determined to accompanying me
6654999 we just need to go quietly if we can just get to howard
6655000 no we were just about to go and try and see what could be done for him but you need help right now come then lets see what can be done about him and you
6655001 they claimed hed escaped i i didnt believe them i beat a couple of people up trying to find out where theyd taken him to i think he really has run hes got no more sense than a child
6655002 we were just planning to go and break him out of the cell well try looking for him with you
6655003 if youll just hold still and let me finish stitching first
6655004 you were going to help him escape i thought about it but i decided that they couldnt possibly convict me i havent done anything wrong well i hadnt before i went in and found he was missing im afraid theyre looking for me too now
6655005 i have a small personal car i can hide kretz in that i need to change your appearance and then i think we can search in reasonable safety
6655006 if we listen in on the police channel on your communicator we may get some idea where he is or if hes been caught or killed
6655007 i thought id try blond once upon a time fortunately im terrible at throwing stuff away
6655008 president saddam hussein has recently told the head of the palestinian political office faroq al kaddoumi his decision to raise the sum granted to each family of the martyrs of the palestinian uprising to 25 000 instead of 10 000
6655009 one of those no room at the inn situations we should have thought ahead its been in all the papers after all henry dreesons little motorcade arrived early this afternoon all the bright lights and would be bright lights of buchenland county have crammed themselves into town
6655010 theres not any place to hang by your fingernails the way it looks wed better plan on going to the next village and hope someone has a spot i sort of feel like we should try to say hello to henry but i dont think we could get anywhere near him
6655011 that probably means that his tour is a big success i hope it is you can say hello to him when he gets back to grantville to ronnie and him both has anybody heard anything about the abbot yet
6655012 oh well too bad we dont have an atv wed be getting home a lot sooner than we will riding these poor beaten down rental horses
6655013 were not going on past fulda hoping to find an inn with space somewhere further along its already late and were worn out all of us by the time we get around the city the places on the other side will already be full with people coming from the other direction who know there wont be places to stay in fulda itself and pulled over early everybody turn around well backtrack a little
6655014 its obvious when you think about it all those orange uniforms out guarding vips means a whole batch of empty bunks in the barracks
6655015 the obligation of hospitality down timers take it seriously just let me nose around and find someone i knew before we left for venice last winter leave it to stone the golden tongued or whatever some poet in a heroic epic might call me if i didnt learn anything else from sandrart actually to be honest i learned quite a bit from him he really improved my schmooze quotient
6655016 hell if that doesnt look like an old west general store whats it doing in barracktown hold up everyone
6655017 were in luck its the sutlers cabin the new guy remodeled everybody left in barracktown seems to be shopping reverend jones may i have the privilege of presenting to you antonia kruger shes married to sergeant johnny furbee who goes to your church in grantville
6655018 if freiherr von schlitz wasnt in jail again for plotting against the government of the sotf hed hate this absolutely hate it
6655019 yup henrys holding up real well rip roarin job of stumping god what a stroke of luck that we managed to get constantin ableidinger to come at the same time the newspapers are eating it up handing on the torch aint that how the magdeburg paper put it ive got to say that jason waters in frankfurt has been earning his keep too
6655020 what do they call it what the kastenmayer boy is doing
6655021 they do it from one language to another too gets the words out in the second language while the audience can still hang onto the tone of voice that the speaker was using when he said them in the first language
6655022 then when henry gets tired ableidinger booms at them for a while
6655023 we ought to get some great publicity when henry goes down to frankfurt to meet ronnie
6655024 if we dont wes wasted a lot of money on flyers wackernagel wangled the printing contract for his brother in law jason waters promised to get it into the frankfurt papers well send a messenger down when the motorcade reaches gelnhausen were pacing ourselves mainz is going to radio through when ronnie gets onto the main barge there so we can stage an impressive reunion
6655025 sort of but i dont think there were any reporters at that one
6655026 at least ones bound to have been there it wouldnt be so famous if someone hadnt covered it
6655027 im worried about them both lenore and chandra bryant holloway was never the man id have picked for lenore at all not that i had anything to say about it at the time and nathans been so standoffish lately like for the past year at least from what i can pick up from her letters theyre both out of town all the time its hard on a young woman to have to bring up her children alone to be mother and father both
6655028 you cant live their lives for them especially not at ten oclock in the evening when you are in fulda and they are in grantville
6655029 think about the good things how well your idea for the speaking tour is working out
6655030 i didnt really expect people to be quite so impressed with henry after all hes just a small town mayor not some dramatic or charismatic political figure
6655031 the people who come to hear him are village and small town mayors and councilmen too mostly and their wives or ordinary people who arent even on the councils almost all of them its important that he isnt some remarkable and alien hero what you would call a superman hes average size short and a little scrawny for an up timer but average size for the seventeenth century he isnt as young as he used to be he walks with a cane he faces a lot of the same problems that they do such as tight budgets and people who constantly complain to the point that theres no pleasing them he doesnt pretend that he has all the answers he just says that he does his best and keeps on trying
6655032 for people like these mike stearns or hans richter may be an inspiration yes constantin ableidinger is an inspiration too but mr dreeson is a comfort they know most of them in their own hearts that they will never be heroes he shows them that they dont have to be to be good citizens to be a valuable part of the use that were trying to build
6655033 he doesnt glorify what he has done in grantville he doesnt say anything about being part of a great miracle he just talks about local government says that he was mayor before the ring of fire and hes kept on being mayor doing the same job to the best of his ability nothing fancy nothing new and special the same man doing the same job that is what he shows them

6655071 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6655072 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6655073 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6655074 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6655075 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6655076 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6655077 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6655078 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6655079 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6655080 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6655081 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6655082 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6655083 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6655084 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6655085 responsibility for the success or failure of a nonprofit like the autism society rests dually with management and with the board of directors
6655086 in this case the board did not appear to be engaged to the point of asking appropriate questions and following up on issues related to the societys financial condition
6655087 as your review notes one of the major causes of the deficit was providing services that were not funded but were consistent with the mission of the organization
6655088 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6655089 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6655090 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest

6655093 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6655094 theyve been cooperating with us and weve been working together trying to get to the bottom of it
6655095 we want to get to the bottom of this and weve taken steps to double check our procedures and reviewed our hand washing with employees just the basics to prevent this from happening again

6655102 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6655103 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6655104 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

6655108 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6655109 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

6655121 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6655122 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6655123 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6655124 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6655125 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6655126 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6655127 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6655128 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6655129 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6655130 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6655131 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6655132 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6655133 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6655134 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6655135 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6655136 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6655137 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6655138 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6655139 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6655140 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6655141 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6655142 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6655143 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6655144 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6655145 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6655146 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6655147 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6655148 dna evidence and photo evidence of the creature will be presented
6655149 gt harry knopp you can track this story using the links to the groups webs
6655150 i dont think that anything is going to change the associated press http ap
6655151 i dont think you ever get used to seeing that type of talent
6655152 if he stays healthy the next two years his numbers are going to be crazy
6655153 she told me if i didnt make as and bs i couldnt play sports
6655154 shes on top of things shes kept tabs on him and made him do right hes a smart kid hes done great in school and we havent had one problem with him its yes sir and no sir with him you can tell hes been raised right
6655155 to show our intelligence we were going to play armanti at wide receiver his junior year
6655156 armanti was willing to do that and he would have been great at that but the kid we were going to play at quarterback got hurt in the first game so armanti became our quarterback
6655157 i didnt know anything about appalachian but i liked it
6655158 it was my first time being in the mountains we dont have mountains in greenwood
6655159 when armanti and coco came in we were thinking coco was going to be the guy
6655160 we liked armanti and thought he was a very good player but we had no idea that he was going to have the stuff that he has the savvy and the poise and all that
6655161 theres always hindsight but i think history shows some people missed on him
6655162 but that miss was appalachians gain its been a great situation for him at appalachian that offensive system really fits him and its worked out the best for armanti and for appalachian but maybe not the best for some of our state schools
6655163 its been great i never expected it coming in theyve let me play the game the way i know how to play it
6655164 its frustrating for our defensive guys who try to pressure him when we scrimmage
6655165 just like this morning he stepped up in the pocket and went underneath the defensive end and he has a guy open in the secondary and he didnt even break stride and just popped him with the ball every day im amazed with what the kid does
6655166 he is as quick as anybody in the first 10 yards after that hes fast hes not dexter jackson fast and he might not be in our top two or three guys fast but hes not far off if he didnt start at quarterback he could definitely start at wide receiver for us
6655167 armanti is tremendously competitive and thats what drives him to be fearless
6655168 its not in his nature to avoid a hit and we wont tell him to thats the way he plays and thats the way i want to see him play
6655169 he puts it in spots ive never seen guys do
6655170 when he knows hes got to get rid of it that ball is just right up by his ear and its gone he doesnt have the strongest arm in the world but he knows his limitations and hes very accurate
6655171 hes pretty much a laid back kind of guy of course hes a little more comfortable around the team than he is to the media and grown folks
6655172 we could be up by 20 or down by 20 hes the same no matter the situation the other 10 guys can look at him and see how calm he is and not worry and know were going to come out of the game with a victory
6655173 the thing he concentrates on every day is just making the right reads in the running game and in the passing game taking care of the football
6655174 as far as his fundamental skills hes where he needs to be i dont know what he can do to get any better put on some weight maybe but he did that this year
6655175 he might wind up being 195 and hes strong now but hell get stronger
6655176 i dont know if anyone will give him a shot at quarterback in the nfl but maybe hell wind up being a randle el type and maybe fit in as a punt returner or receiver hes athletic enough to do that
6655177 as long as there is another game to play theres another game to try to win that never gets old
6655178 se acord para este a o un total de 3000 millones de d lares y 2000 millones ya se colocaron as que antes de fin de a o habr otra emisi n por 1000 millones
6655179 en el caso de la argentina y de otros pa ses hemos cooperado para que puedan resolver algunos desajustes porque es una directriz del presidente ch vez
6655180 porque el ministerio de finanzas obliga a los bancos a no tener m s del 30 por ciento de sus bonos en divisas y muchos ya estaban excedidos cuando se produjo esta colocaci n
6655181 no se trata de una tasa cara o barata sino de la que corresponde por las condiciones del mercado que el gobierno no puede alterar la argentina es un pa s con gran potencial econ mico pero en ese momento se decidi respaldar a su gobierno por las condiciones generadas por el conflicto con el campo
6655182 la argentina se dej sorprender por ch vez no lo conocen l no tiene amigos sino aliados circunstanciales y a su pa s le cobr una tasa casi de default
6655183 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6655184 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6655185 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6655186 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6655187 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6655188 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6655189 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6655190 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6655191 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6655192 new zealand is a beautiful country full of beautiful people
6655193 i love you jack look i named my camera after you
6655194 i guess i felt a lot of pressure i was putting pressure on myself but theres no reason to
6655195 i just felt like we needed to come out and blow everybody away and let people know it wasnt a fluke the year before we kind of got out of rhythm and got out of our game plan i wasnt as comfortable as i normally was
6655196 he put a little too much pressure on himself to be matt ryan
6655197 he wanted to match up with matt he was as nervous as ive seen him and he made a couple of poor red zone decisions
6655198 i think thats going to be the biggest thing this year is just relaxing and going in and just having fun and being smart and doing what we always do
6655199 i think youve got a very comfortable guy in riley right now
6655200 i think youve got a guy who realizes that he doesnt have to be a rock star he doesnt have to be the guy he just has to be a guy who doesnt get us beat
6655201 i did a lot more shoulder exercises and i tried to strengthen my shoulder a lot
6655202 thats been a point of emphasis and i think its helped put a little more zip on the ball
6655203 during seven on seven this summer just with the players going out there and organizing it and playing we were throwing touchdowns to the fullbacks throwing touchdowns to the tight end throwing touchdowns to everybody
6655204 it was everybody nobody had the majority of the catches
6655205 and i think coach lobo is doing a great job of integrating everybody in our offense people were able to just hound kenny last year and just focus on him i think now being able to throw to every one of our skill guys is going to be a big part of our offense and is going to be tough on defenses
6655206 but i wouldnt want his goals to be set on being better than last year id like for his goals to be set on winning more games than last year
6655207 we went into the match against italy relaxed about winning or losing thats why we lose
6655208 melissa dont let your mouth overload your hardware sit tight and serve your community fairly the real diarrhea is the way you want that committee to be more than what it is settle down and do your civic duty and maybe later you can serve on a board with real teeth that makes real changes for brownsville
6655209 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6655210 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6655211 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6655212 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6655213 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6655214 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this

6655221 it seems most people from the west have a hate on for toronto
6655222 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6655223 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6655224 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6655225 musim lalu wes merupakan salah seorang yang tampil paling konsisten dia layak mendapatkan segala kesuksesan itu termasuk tempat di tim nasional inggris
6655226 saya memiliki banyak tantangan di depan saya dan salah satu yang terberat adalah mendapatkan posisi saya kembali dan mengalahkan wes itu akan menjadi hal yang sulit
6655227 keadaan terlihat baik buat luca kami berharap dia akan kembali hari sabtu nanti dan semuanya akan terlihat berbeda lagi

6655229 we all hope that the olympic summer games in china will be a great success and that the olympic ideals will come to life that is why we are asking you to enable a peaceful solution for the issue of tibet and other conflicts in your country with respect to fundamental principles of human rights to protect freedom of expression freedom of religion and freedom of opinion in your country including tibet to ensure that human rights defenders are no longer intimidated or imprisoned to stop the death penalty

6655232 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6655233 consumption of oil and oil products is responsible for 57 of the co2 emissions in the country today and among all oil consuming sectors co2 emissions from transport are increasing at the fastest rate at more than 6 per cent per annum the need of the hour therefore is to think of methods to conserve fuel it is sad that even a seemingly evolved city like bangalore is not willing to take the lead in fuel conservation
6655234 a drastic overhaul of our public transport system and a major change in the citizens perception of it is in order for any major impetus towards fuel conservation to happen
6655235 even if a person does not consider himself to be an environmentalist a little fuel conservation can really help not just the environment but also the wallet the price of petrol and diesel seems to always be on the rise the best defense against rising gas prices is fuel conservation
6655236 nos ltimos dez anos essa talvez tenha sido uma das modifica es mais marcantes no contexto empresarial brasileiro

6655239 one of the most important things we can do to restore the american peoples trust in congress is prove that we can be effective stewards of their hard earned money
6655240 western new yorkers and all americans deserve a government that can better live within its means
6655241 its a huge advantage when you try to meet a payroll you can understand the type of regulations that can impede your business
6655242 some of the other candidates dont have that level of experience
6655243 the more money you give washington they will spend it and they wont spend it properly
6655244 they can no longer trust congress to look after their tax dollars

6655252 hes done a really good job and is making plays were going to need him
6655253 hes been very solid hes really improved since day 1 with his strength and accuracy
6655254 i was real proud of the job i had done
6655255 you know thats a big deal when youre a kid he kind of told me the technique start on the top and work down
6655256 the ninth time he walked out and looked at the car it was finally finished i had to rewash the whole car every time
6655257 i think lifes about finishing so we try to teach that lesson in everything we do
6655258 i want to see our players finish their papers in what they do academically i want them to finish each weight room workout the same way
6655259 i just think its a way of life do i think that happens easy i think thats something that a lot of us spend half a lifetime trying to develop its a work in progress with us i cant say that all our guys understand that right now
6655260 theres been a huge buzz about football on campus just because of coach cutcliffe a man of his caliber
6655261 he attracts people with his personality a lot of people are excited because hes doing everything to put duke football on the map
6655262 i think we had a real issue with speed and depth at ole miss very similar to duke
6655263 what we did have was two or three great players in place we had some first rounders
6655264 i dont know that we have any first rounders on our team here
6655265 women can now give consumer reviews of doctors midwives hospitals and birth centers learn about the choices and birth experiences of others and view data on hospital and birth center standard practices and intervention rates
6655266 our goal is to give women a mechanism that can be used to share information about maternity care practices in their community while at the same time providing practitioners and institutions feedback for quality of care improvement efforts
6655267 for years consumers have enthusiastically shared online reviews of movies restaurants products and services but readily available information about maternity care providers and birth settings was nearly unattainable but no longer
6655268 hats off to the coalition for improving maternity services the incredible women working within community based birth networks throughout the us and to all the women who are sharing their birth stories
6655269 share your story voice your opinion mamas its important and it feels really good kind of like having a baby if you dont how will your experience help others
6655270 no space for db please delete more than 60 mb
6655271 i dont mind the expectations and i dont think our players do either
6655272 i think its validation that people recognize that we made strides as a football program i think the biggest compliment that other coaches paid media paid and fans paid to our football team is how hard our players played
6655273 we werent good in some games there were things that we didnt do well we didnt win some games we would have liked to have won but every single saturday those kids went out there and they competed they spilled their guts on the line they put it out there
6655274 that certainly is an advantage for him i think the other two quarterbacks cam sexton and mike paulus are pushing him and thats making him a better quarterback he knows hes got to go out and push he puts pressure on himself but those guys are putting pressure on him to perform well every day in practice
6655275 during the spring coach wanted me to help a lot with teaching to the other quarterbacks
6655276 he always says to teach it you have to know it you have to know it really really well
6655277 going through the spring and watching as much film as possible it helped me learn the offense a lot better and going at it from a coachs aspect i watched the whole practice and watched everybody else run the offense
6655278 i feel like i can be that 1 000 yard back that weve been missing
6655279 now weve got to play more physical now there are some things that weve got to do that will control the outcomes of games that weve got control over
6655280 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6655281 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6655282 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6655283 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6655284 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6655285 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6655286 i have been involved with rock the vote since its inception and am proud of the work they have done
6655287 there are such critical issues facing our country from high gas prices to climate change that we need to do more then just register to vote we need to get our friends registered too
6655288 over 600 of the operations that were canceled were in fact brought forward to an earlier date and around 1 000 were administrative cancellations which are about how the hospital schedules its work

6655290 beyond the speeches how much do you know about barack obama what does he really believe consider this united 93 never hit the capitol on 9 11 but the capitol was bombed thirty years before by an american terrorist group called weather underground that declared war on the u s targeting the capitol the pentagon police stations and more one of the groups leaders william ayers admits to the bombings proudly saying later we didnt do enough some members of the group ayers founded even went on to kill police but barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama american issues project is responsible for the content of this ad

6655293 every trail community will present plays movies tours and discussion panels that explore the masterworks of southern literature and honor their authors
6655294 at a time when many of our competitors are reducing their hours or closing their branches we wanted to show our customers that we really understand and respond to their banking needs
6655295 opening on saturdays will mean that we will be able to help more customers deal with their financial needs whether its paying in a cheque or sorting out their mortgage
6655296 clearly travel is time consuming and wearing on both the body and the mind but it can be enjoyable seeing new places getting to meet different people with different outlooks and culture exploring new cuisines and occasionally doing tourist type activities although only for the odd hour or two when a meeting is unexpectedly cancelled
6655297 why go well first when doing business overseas the only way to get the feel of the company its culture ethics and people is to visit and look around for any form of corporate transaction this is essential
6655298 second there is a limit to the level of interaction even the most modern and sophisticated communication device can deliver a personal meeting is essential to conduct complex negotiations and for recruitment purposes
6655299 youre analysing not just the words spoken and the body language you are evaluating attitude emotions and negotiating strengths
6655300 even the best video links cant pick up the way the body performs under pressure
6655301 also a lot can be learned about the way the person you are dealing with interacts with other people in the organisation
6655302 what message are you sending to the other party when you decide whether to go or to stay if you go you are saying you are important to me i am willing to make an effort to do business with you
6655303 if a business has a widely dispersed base of employees clients or partners it makes sense to make use of virtual meeting technology its affordable for smes as well as large businesses and saves money on fuel
6655304 its now possible to create environments where people can get together and work as if they were in the same place even if they are halfway across the world
6655305 an emerging area in virtual meetings is the use of 3d conferencing technology and avatars much like something you would see in second life video conferencing is also getting more popular as business people become more web savvy by using sites like facebook and youtube in their spare time
6655306 after 10 minutes of a videoconference you forget you are not in the room with the other people
6655307 closing some deals will always need a physical meeting but i firmly believe that 95 per cent of meetings can be done using technology
6655308 for larger companies a growing trend is telepresence which uses life sized high definition video with audio to help participants feel as if they are meeting face to face
6655309 this is a solid performance against a background of some challenging conditions
6655310 businesses understand and support the need to invest in our railways and they know this work is essential
6655311 but firms also need guarantees that work will be scheduled to avoid damaging the economy and that delays will be minimised
6655312 we have recently put in place an improvement plan and this is already showing positive results
6655313 when the west coast work is completed this december we expect to see dramatic improvements in terms of the number of services we can run as well as the reliability of the line providing a boost for businesses throughout the region
6655314 our strategy has had a massive effect on the success of the business as our people are our key assets
6655315 its crucial to look after your people treat them well train them and invest in them
6655316 most of our senior management team have worked their way up in the business and have stakes in the company i believe that staff who are committed to the business will perform better and will be more productive
6655317 we place great emphasis on training and our new headquarters have improved facilities and we carry out regular employee surveys and hold open forums where they can air views and suggestions
6655318 as a result of recent forums we are looking at introducing more flexible working and other benefits and we have set aside a room for showers so people can freshen up if they cycle or jog to work
6655319 we also arrange teambuilding events and this year spent a weekend in the lake district doing activities such as sailing and mountain biking
6655320 in addition we are investing heavily in technology to improve our internal communications website accounting systems and database
6655321 youre just trying to get into the round and kind of build some momentum on your side

6655351 i think it was a breakthrough game for the whole offence to be honest
6655352 we have not had a big rushing game this year and it was good to have one
6655353 the linemen really opened up the holes everything was working
6655354 that is one facet of our game that we need
6655355 if we can tie it in with the rest of what we are trying to do it will just make us better
6655356 i thought we could have played better than we did
6655357 overall i thought we just played well enough to win
6655358 if we are all honest with each other i do not think anybody could sit here and say who is going to win it and who is going to finish in second third or fourth
6655359 from that point on we could not really rally on defence or make plays on offence
6655360 they will respond and come back and play well again
6655361 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6655362 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6655363 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6655364 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
6655365 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
6655366 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6655367 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6655368 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
6655369 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
6655370 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
6655371 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
6655372 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
6655373 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
6655374 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
6655375 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
6655376 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
6655377 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind

6655515 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment
6655516 all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6655517 this incident does not appear to be related to them

6655537 the kane county health department will be conducting an on site inspection of the walter paytons roundhouse after several complaints about flies within the meals
6655538 please stay away until the kane county health department issues their official findings
6655539 quickly deemed to be an inappropriate use of city e mail
6655540 the city does not adopt endorse or approve of the e mail the employee did not collect the information alleged in the e mail and send the e mail at the request of the city but acted on his own
6655541 the contents of the e mail are solely attributable to the sender and not the city furthermore the city did not authorize the employee to speak on its behalf with regards to this matter and the employee did not speak on behalf of the city
6655542 we are not in the habit of making presumptions until we have gathered all of our facts
6655543 everything surrounding mr maysonet and his employment remains status quo
6655544 while i sent the e mail from my city of aurora e mail address during the workday i did not act as a city employee in doing so and did not intend to make it appear that way i sent the e mail as an individual and the thoughts and words of the message are mine alone
6655545 no one at the city gave me permission to send the e mail and i did not receive permission after the fact for sending it i apologize if it appeared that the city issued a health warning for the roundhouse because i did not intend for that to happen
6655546 i cant believe hes still employed but as long as the city keeps him on im going to assume they endorse his actions
6655547 walter paytons name is on this restaurant and we keep it there with as much respect as it deserves for this guy to talk about walter paytons roundhouse like that thats where i draw the line
6655548 my attorneys are involved and i intend to pursue this as far as i can
6655549 i think the guy didnt like the barbecue sauce dressing combination he created on the salad and tried to give it back so we comped it
6655550 but he became rude and made quite a scene when we wouldnt refund him for the burger that he finished

6655590 like schooling driving tests etc but nothing prepares us for what men expect when they are dating women it can be hard enough to put yourself out there and look for quality men let alone know what to do to keep that man when they show an interest

6655592 in reality what works to trigger attraction and a deep emotional desire for commitment in a man isnt the common female conception of love and seduction

6655667 other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6655668 we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6655669 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment
6655670 all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6655671 we are a sovereign nation each one of us as citizens of this country must now ask are we going to be bullied and pressured into doing things that are clearly not in our national interest
6655672 against this background and the situation which fiji is in now fijis people need to realize that in going forward as a nation we may have to paddle our canoes on our own

6655706 protest pens meant to segregate demonstrations a system that has been set in place to deflect criticism about the lack of freedom to protest the lack of freedom of assembly and demonstration in china
6655707 federal and local authorities are girding for huge protests mammoth traffic tie ups and civil disturbances
6655708 the city said they couldnt disclose information because the secret service wouldnt tell the city their plans but once we filed suit suddenly the started releasing information then the second phase of the suit was to challenge the constitutionality of the security arrangements which the judge of course upheld
6655709 mark cohen testified that the security conditions around the dnc will make demonstrators look like animals in a cage and that the delegates wont hear them he also said that the public demonstration zone is blocked by a media tent and other structures that limit sight and sound access to the delegates it is not the image of fellow citizens but rather prisoners in a cage with no clear connection to the purpose of their being there cohen said

6655719 ignoring a city prohibition against the collection of first amendment related intelligence the denver police developed files on 208 organizations and 3 200 individuals the department appears to have continued its surveillance until the fall of 2002 despite the aclu lawsuit monitored groups included the american friends service committee a pacifist quaker group amnesty international and many others with no history of criminal activity documents obtained by the aclu describe how police intercepted e mails recorded the license plate numbers of vehicles at demonstrations and infiltrated advocacy group meetings
6655720 federal and state law enforcement officials in colorado plan to increase intelligence operations during the democratic national convention in denver and run a fusion center where intelligence analysts will collect and analyze reports of suspicious activity civil rights advocates fear the fusion center could enable unwarranted spying on protesters exercising their first amendment rights at the convention
6655721 these centers have very robust police powers and domestic intelligence collecting powers and what weve seen in the past is that when police agencies are given secret powers to spy they abuse those powers and where there is very unclear line of accountability the chances of something bad happening under that system were very high

6655762 that means the bus can travel as far as gurnee and libertyville for people who have doctor appointments there
6655763 it was such a great deal that we just couldnt pass it up
6655764 we are planning on putting in a schedule of sorts where the bus will head to condell medical center in libertyville one day then to northern illinois medical center in mchenry one day to help out the seniors who need to go to the doctor
6655765 we are also looking for and applying for grants to offset the cost of operating the bus five days a week rather than just three days

6655816 the parents who are over the top youre never going to change
6655817 its about the incessant pressure on the rest of us its very hard to have the inner fortitude to resist that pressure
6655818 this generation really does feel a commitment to the ultimate emotional outcome of their kids
6655819 fifty years ago parents were content to provide food shelter and education today much more is expected of you
6655820 were very nervous we want our kids to do ok in this new world we want to prepare them as we should
6655821 but we tend to go over the top we cant do anything in moderation were either supersize me or on a diet
6655822 its happening here like its happening at a lot of selective schools in this country
6655823 if you read the popular press you read that all this over scheduling will lead to admission at the school of your choice
6655824 if you are part of the great middle underneath that bell shaped curve not the 1 or 2 percenters the world class musician the world class dancer the world class athlete but everybody else it really doesnt matter if youre scheduled to the gills thats not going to overcome a mediocre transcript

6655826 just because you were second team all district in soccer terrific for you but thats not going to get you into a selective college
6655827 if you read the popular press youd believe it is so difficult to get into college but the vast majority of schools are admitting well over 70 percent of their applicant pool
6655828 they all have 4 0 gpas all have fabulous test scores all have taken six ap courses their junior and senior years thats when the r sum starts taking on greater importance
6655829 the ones that are gifted talented and academically sharp tend to have a glorious time
6655830 they can be lifted to the extent of their abilities the ones that cant keep up have a harder time they have to keep up their parents demand they keep up and of course youll have casualties
6655831 i was talking with a lawyer friend recently and he was grumbling that the younger lawyers he sees are much more aggressive and competitive and they dont need to be
6655832 when you have a childhood that instead of going out into the fields and playing by the stream and poking into things and reading books is a pressure cooker from the time you enter preschool you grow up in aggressive mode while that will help you get ahead its going to do a number on personal relationships
6655833 what you need to ask is are they supplanting the things we should be doing as a family
6655834 to have the energy and good humor that parents need to nurture their children they must have a life too
6655835 the greatest skill and the hardest to develop is the self confidence that youre the best parent your kids are going to have in the end youre the one who has to make the decisions and take the responsibility
6655836 parenting is a higher calling than being a cruise ship activities director
6655837 if you can pay attention as a parent and help them discern an interest or two then do what you can to nurture that

6655842 i say dont look at your debt more than one hour a week that hour is when you pay bills and its when you cry moan and feel bad if you need to the rest of the time you need to be proactive thinking about positive ways to save money be happy about the fact that youre doing everything you can and go to sleep at night
6655843 what we know is that isolation kills which means it drives up stress and community or being with other people in disclosure and telling the truth is a healing balm
6655844 it is physiologically impossible to be stressed and be grateful at the same time so when you see that bill and think that you just cant take one more thing take a deep breath and be thankful
6655845 i cant think of anything else that is more important than having our children safe
6655846 id say its rarely reported normally it comes to my attention because of some external force in most of my cases i rarely get a prompt report its rare something happens to a child and its reported right away
6655847 the sexual abuse of children can be a taboo subject but its very important
6655848 its something that is crucial for everyone to know about its not something that should be swept under the rug at all
6655849 i came into this with the attitude that i would be willing to do whatever i could to help the eagles win this season
6655850 but i also felt like i would have a lot of opportunities in front of me and i had to take advantage of them
6655851 i knew the eagles needed a big play receiver and i want to be that person
6655852 desean is a good player but lets not let the preseason deceive us any first
6655853 he has a lot of hard work ahead of him
6655854 he does show up though i think hes going to be a pretty good player he has progressed very quickly up to this point but how quickly he progresses from this point on will determine how productive he will be for us in the near future
6655855 i think desean has done a great job but its not fair for people to look at him and say all of a sudden that he is going to be the next carolina wide receiver steve smith and compare him to some of the greats
6655856 you kind of have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted in this league
6655857 this is the preseason most teams that we have played play pass coverage that are pretty much vanilla basic but its good for him to get his feet wet hopefully things will work out well
6655858 its a good thing to have the offensive line together
6655859 thats a positive thing because you want continuity there granted theyve played together a long time since 2006 but they need to get in there and get some work in during the preseason
6655860 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6655861 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted

6655871 by the end of next week we will know what this department will look like
6655872 i think that what is being looked at is how the district can best support our teachers and leaders in carrying that out
6655873 the debt is selling right now because the bond market thinks the government is going to step in and take over
6655874 if the treasury continues to hold their breath debt spreads will widen back up
6655875 i do not think it government intervention is going to happen this weekend i do not know if it is going happen within the next couple of weeks
6655876 the more the stocks trade down the higher the probability they will have to act i do not think 3 is that trigger point but it is certainly getting there
6655877 if they are able to roll over their debt in late september and the dollar amount is substantial then it signals that the credit markets are comfortable enough with the current situation and with the government backstop and that buys them a fair amount of time
6655878 if that does not turn out well then the treasury if they have not already done so will at that point be forced to step in and act more quickly than they would have
6655879 nobody is going to put equity capital or preferred stock into fannie and freddie with whats the government going to do hanging over your head
6655880 if the government were to provide support that didnt wipe out shareholders you will have another year of bad quarters and it then starts getting better so theres a lot of upside potential
6655881 if i had known i was going to live this long i would have taken better care of myself

6655884 undertake comprehensive analysis of the transitioning to a 4 day work week for all possible federal employees and inform me by august 31 of any additional actions congress would need to take to implement such a policy by the end of fiscal year 2008
6655885 authorizes a versatile and innovative work scheduling program for use in the federal government
6655886 many management officials are finding that the use of flexible and compressed work schedules can help resolve a number of personnel problems
6655887 in these times of high gasoline prices i believe the federal government should do all it can to ensure that federal agencies and departments are appropriately reducing gasoline consumption this goal can be accomplished with the adoption of personnel policies to limit unnecessary commuting
6655888 state and local governments across the nation including new mexico virginia and utah are implementing 4 day work weeks to conserve energy reduce fuel consumption and alleviate congestion
6655889 federal employers will have to offer employees more flexibility in their work lives if they are to successfully recruit and retain qualified workers
6655890 use of flexible and compressed work schedules helped agencies recruit for some hard to fill jobs and helped agencies retain employees who otherwise would have resigned or been terminated
6655891 one of the options we would seriously consider is that we would possibly
6655892 if we cant have a competitive proposal there doesnt seem to be a lot of value in us going through this process if the best we can do is come up with a proposal that falls short of what the department of defense is looking for
6655893 hi im taryn davis im 21 years old and im from lima new york
6655894 in high school i just felt like i didnt have a place and i felt like i didnt fit in anywhere and i just felt really rejected
6655895 i turned to drugs and alcohol and anything that would just make me feel like i fit in somewhere
6655896 when i just felt like i couldnt cry enough i couldnt get angry enough i would cut my arms just to find a way to release the pain in a way and just control situations that i felt like i couldnt control
6655897 i just kind of saw well im being hurt so it must be gods fault in a way so a lot of it i started to blame christianity and god for the troubles i was having
6655898 one night i was hanging out with my friends and we were drinking and smoking and driving around and all of a sudden i just got this feeling that something bad was about to happen and i remember driving in the car and just begging my friend to stop and just begging him to pull over and he would just go faster and faster and for the first time in a really long time i prayed to god that hed protect my life and he would put his hand over the car and bring us to safety before you knew it i was back in the parking lot and i forgot all about that prayer that i had prayed it and i just continued hanging out with my friends
6655899 then i got a text message from another friend of mine saying that my friend had just died in a car accident i was just so shocked that could happen life can be short i mean life can be over before you know it and i just remember asking god why and i just realized that this could happen to me if i dont really take my life seriously and head in the direction i need to be in
6655900 i thought that it would be a quick fix in a way i just thought since i was here all my problems would be solved
6655901 i thought id be okay i thought i had made the right changes but just seeing my old habits again i just fell right back into them
6655902 i really felt alone and just further away from god than id ever felt
6655903 i met this one guy who was terminally ill and in the midst of all that was going on in his life he was raising his hands and worshipping god and that really touched me in a way and i just thought if this man who is in this hospital alone can praise god for who he is then i can too and that was the moment when i really wanted to change and i really wanted to have a relationship with god
6655904 with gods help and gods grace and reading the bible and really learning who god was and who i was and how god saw me i love jesus because he has redeemed my life he died for my sins and he has freed me from the pain of rejection and my depression he has forgiven me of all my mistakes
6655905 the majority of the party thinks that asif zardari should be president
6655906 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6655907 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6655908 if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6655909 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6655910 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6655911 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6655912 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6655913 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6655914 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6655915 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6655916 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6655917 when the price of oil has fallen by more than 20 percent and other commodities from steel and aluminum to corn and wheat have all fallen in price significantly it represents a cushion for the economy
6655918 it is one of the few supports that we have in the economy right now
6655919 the fiscal stimulus provided extra money that helped people get through that period where commodities were at their peak
6655920 the fundamentals of the labor market are still getting worse asset prices are falling credit is contracting all of these things should be negative for consumer spending
6655921 the good news is that lower oil prices puts more money in consumer pockets
6655922 the bad news is that it could be signaling a global slowdown
6655923 this is sad for u s softball because our expectations were so high
6655924 but at the same time im an olympic silver medalist and not many people can say that
6655925 i saw the runner going home out of the corner of my eye and i guess i rushed a little bit didnt make as good a throw as i could have
6655926 you train your whole life for this you want to win as for the big picture i havent really thought about it thats something ill do in the future for right now it is what it seems to be
6655927 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
6655928 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6655929 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6655930 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6655931 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration
6655932 escrts are like the recycling units of the cell they oversee the constant intake break down and replenishing of junctions on the cell surface
6655933 in a cancer cell where escrts are damaged the junctions may not be restored properly this can cause cells to separate and migrate to form secondary tumours in other parts of the body
6655934 previous studies have shown a link between escrts and the loss of junctions in cells of fruit flies so we want to see whether this is also true in humans
6655935 this work should tell us more about the role of escrts in cancer and provide possible new targets for therapy in the future
6655936 were trying to get the nerve tissue to integrate with a device to grow into it to form a better connection
6655937 to get long term release we think these multi component systems are the way to go
6655938 we can control the release by combining the materials in different ways and were confident that we can extend the release time further even to 90 days
6655939 reactive oxygen species lead to oxidative stress in the body which can also cause dna damage we were able to gather clear evidence of a short term increase in certain indicators for oxidative stress during the competition and have already published these results however now we were also able to demonstrate that despite this increase no notable and persistent damage was caused to the athletes dna this is a surprising result which initially appears to contradict the data gathered in similar studies
6655940 the comparable studies analysed different biomarkers for predominantly short lived dna damage our study focused primarily on damage to dna that was subsequently evident in daughter cells following cell division and could therefore be of long term detriment to the body however we can sound the all clear in this respect our study clearly shows that in this case extreme competitive sport did not result in any increase in dna damage
6655941 combined hrt improves sleep aches and pains and sexual functioning these gains can now be factored in to a womans choice to use combined hrt
6655942 this benefit must be weighed against the overall short and long term risks which must be individualised for women based on years since menopause medical history and chosen regimen further research with appropriate measures is needed to assess more fully the impact of combined hrt on all aspects of health related quality of life for postmenopausal women
6655943 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6655944 i took a child into the truck and he thought he was in a film
6655945 he asked when will this film end and where is my dad he asked if it was real if he was in a film but he wanted the film to end
6655946 its been years since engine failure on take off or a fire has prevented a flight from continuing
6655947 we have to closely monitor the records but we see no reason to take such measures
6655948 we convinced the organiser to cancel the event planned for this weekend
6655949 its not the first time that someone drinks alcohol in zurich
6655950 but weve never had this kind of collective indulgence organised over the internet
6655951 a wave of alcohol is washing over all of switzerland
6655952 after all the press coverage every young person will want to go now it becomes really interesting
6655953 a person has offered to take responsibility for the next event so we are in discussions about tolerating it
6655954 people want one last party at the end of the summer believe me by october nobody will want to hang around in the park anymore
6655955 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
6655956 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6655957 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
6655958 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
6655959 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
6655960 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6655961 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6655962 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
6655963 we are at a competitive disadvantage with cities that have a much larger block of hotel rooms within walking distance

6655985 he had no idea until sunday he had any problem nor did we or anyone else
6655986 his family and i were the only ones who knew gene had a very aggressive form of pancreatic cancer
6655987 i think gene is one of the most pivotal people in the history of the nfl
6655988 players past and present had no better friend than gene upshaw with time people will come to fully understand and appreciate his contributions and his legacy it was genes strength and conviction that got the players to where they are today
6655989 i would say no life is easily reduced to one issue and we had our issues and hes caused some suffering but theres still some humanity and our hearts and prayers go out to his family
6655990 upshaw was an easy target but the problem was bigger than him it is the institution itself and the commissioner he would be the pi ata and take the beating and make it seem that one man was taking the shots but the problem is more than just him
6655991 a lot of people forget theres no such thing as unanimous support in any body you represent but from a results standpoint what more could you want the retired players some of them are getting four times what they would have gotten if gene hadnt been there the stuff about being too close to tagliabue id like to have anyone explain to me how the players havent been served by gene the owners just opted out of this labor deal because it was such a bad deal for them and such a good deal for the players

6656024 in a response from players and fans alike pfc decided now was the time to launch an interactive forum where we can get some fun filled discussions and debates going on
6656025 weve noticed that nobody was commenting on the articles on the official website for whatever reason but a forum provides a more interactive discussion and allows the players and fans alike to start discussion it should be a great experience for all

6656055 its one of our most beautiful and artistic films to date in typical celeste fashion yet is full of raw and hardcore sex scenes with industry favorites such as our own jana cova plus kinzie kenner and erik everhard celeste has the amazing ability to capture sexual performances that our seemingly contradictions lascivious liaisons is both intense and intimate fierce and passionate and it appeals to both men and women
6656056 earned every bit of the highly recommended i rated it for while i admit to thinking jana cova was a major reason for the rating the levels of playful fuck for the buck and replay value also impressed me lascivious liaisons was a solid combination of creative talent on both sides of the camera that many of you will find to be passionate energetic and very much appreciated so pick up a copy when it comes out fans of jana will probably want two copies given how lovely she looked on the cover as well

6656102 bill c 484 endangers abortion rights and womens rights by establishing fetal personhood
6656103 the most deeply worrying aspect of what ms arthur and her co advocates against bill c 484 are doing in flooding the public square with such articles is that the public and members of parliament who have an especially important role to play in this debate might not realize the serious errors of law in ms arthurs arguments
6656104 as a result they could act on the basis of false information about the law and about the assumed legal impact of bill c 484
6656105 the rule of law is the cornerstone of democracy consequently respect for the law in terms of not intentionally misrepresenting it is one of the most fundamental values on which we establish canadian society it would be profoundly worrying if the law were to become a puppet of a particular ideology and used with reckless abandon with respect to the accuracy of its content it is even more disturbing if elected members of parliament unwittingly promote these inaccuracies and cast their vote based on them
6656106 bill c 484 does not make the fetus a person as arcc claims
6656107 it does recognize the existence of the fetus as a number of presently existing laws already do including the criminal code and tort law importantly bill c 484 if it were to become law would in fact not affect the law on abortion nor would it criminalize pregnant women for any harm they may cause to their own fetuses unborn children c 484 is only about abortion for those abortion rights advocates who are so extreme in their views that they cannot get past their strident ideology to feel any compassion for a woman who is such a tragic victim
6656108 an absolutist reaction that denies everything the statutes assert that a fetus constitutes a human life that killing it is in some contexts criminally wrong and that the murder of a pregnant woman and the resultant death of her fetus amount to two losses rather than one risks corroborating in the public mind the allegation that pro choicers espouse an extreme anti life position moreover this approach impedes holding wrongdoers such as abusive spouses accountable for their actions
6656109 ms arthur and arcc claim to be the great defenders of womens rights and yet by opposing bill c 484 they are robbing women of the added protection in criminal law of bringing their children safely into the world they are denying justice to the woman who has been victimized by a brutal crime one which has violently taken her yet to be born but very much wanted child from her womb how can ms arthur and arcc claim to speak for women when they work so hard to rob such a violated woman of basic human compassion and justice
6656110 the majority of canadians including the majority of canadian women across the country as demonstrated by three national polls support this legislation they see the bill for what it really is a sincere effort to support women who make the choice to bring their wanted child into the world in safety
6656111 the truth about bill c 484 a compassionate and constitutionally valid remedy to current injustice in canadian criminal law

6656172 when i said goodbye to him the last thing sean said was daddy score for me score for pompey
6656173 i felt dreadful about missing that chance it happened because i was over confident but i feared that might be my only opportunity and that i would let sean down
6656174 luckily there was a lot of time left to make amends and i managed to do that i am so proud i have won trophies throughout my career but this is the best and the best goal ever because of what it means to portsmouths history
6656175 im not putting any pressure on but lets face it people the world over watched the game and saw my goal and what it means for portsmouth i hope people at the club will remember what i did for them
6656176 i am here at the club for next season but maybe i deserve a bigger contract after scoring a goal like that it has put portsmouth into the uefa cup everyone is happy me the supporters and the players in the team who have not won many medals
6656177 you have to go to work you have to keep going i had to go on with a smile on my face if i had looked down the players would soon have picked up on that and it would have done no one any good
6656178 there was no point in feeling sorry for myself but i have never done that anyway
6656179 did i ever think of walking away from it in those hard times never not once
6656180 it has been a difficult year outside football but to win the cup today is fantastic
6656181 we are a very close family even my grandkids were here today its great
6656182 my wife sandra helped to keep me going shes a wonderful person but like everyone else i went through those difficult times and came through it happens
6656183 im going back home to see if my two dogs are all right and then i am going to the restaurant with my wife
6656184 ill open a nice bottle of red wine and have a good meal
6656185 then in the morning i will get on a bus and have a ride round the city with the players this has been a great day for me but i still think keeping portsmouth up a few years ago was a bigger achievement
6656186 now we have to establish ourselves as a top half team in the premier league and that is not going to be easy maybe we can get another top half finish next season and another trip to wembley
6656187 it was another hard game scrappy but we deserved to win the lads held tight we have only conceded one goal in the whole competition
6656188 its fantastic this is a brilliant day for everyone whos connected with portsmouth
6656189 we worked hard we had our luck through the rounds but in the end the result was good
6656190 cardiff played good football they had good chances but i think the quality came through

6656455 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6656456 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6656457 while he is still here he is very much 100 a tottenham player that is how we consider things
6656458 it is not a case of finding a solution to a problem before it occurs
6656459 weve got a list of targets that we are working very hard on
6656460 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual we know what we are working towards and we know what our objectives are
6656461 the process of signing players sometimes takes time but fans should be aware we are trying to strengthen up front and sign a new forward quite often these things take time
6656462 im sure if shaun signs he will relish the chance to return
6656463 its a good move for him and a good move for the club
6656464 we are always looking to improve and he is another good player
6656465 we have a good squad as it is now and we know shaun can play in a number of positions
6656466 he had a good spell at celtic the first time so im sure he will do well again
6656467 we have five or six scottish internationals in the celtic team already so he will be another good addition
6656468 i played with shaun at international level and i know what he can bring to the team
6656469 so it will be good for both club and country
6656470 i picked up an ankle injury in the first game of the season against st mirren and its been bothering me ever since but hopefully it will be okay for the weekend
6656471 but i will leave that with the medical team at celtic
6656472 you can turn round and say its not been a great start of the season for us but it has been because what ive seen in patches is better than weve done in a lot of last season
6656473 if we were ruthless we would have picked up something against rangers and we would have picked up something against hibs

6656479 i wanted to come to arsenal because the potential to win trophies is there and the fire is still in my heart
6656480 hopefully i can look forward to a fresh start without any injuries
6656481 i left united especially because i did not want to spend any more time on the bench after nine years
6656482 i did not want to spend an extra one just waiting for the testimonial to arrive that is not my mentality
6656483 i was looking at a new challenge and when someone like arsenal comes along you cannot say no
6656484 it will be natural to give some advice but i will not be focusing on that
6656485 the main thing is to be part of the team and perform well to show an example on and off the field
6656486 i would not have expected that but sir alex ferguson and i had a very good relationship that is why i stayed so long there because playing for him was a great honour
6656487 he listened to me and would not go against me so i am pleased
6656488 it is hard to leave because there are so many nice people there
6656489 but the fans will understand that as a player you leave
6656490 i was loyal to man united for nine years and will now be loyal to arsenal and perform as much as i can which is all that matters

6656509 r calf usa experienced a shake up in early 2007 driven by member established policy the majority of its directors had officially demanded that usda u s department of agriculture not issue the over 30 month otm rule concerning bse bovine spongiform encephalopathy because usda failed to disclose its plan to allow both otm cattle and otm beef into the united states the seated president and a minority of directors disagreed and took steps that reversed r calf usas official action this led to a vote by the board of directors to unseat the president resignations by the president three additional board members and several committee chairs followed during the next 18 months r calf usa worked to reinstate its member established position that the otm rule must be stopped in part because the agency brazenly failed to disclose its true intentions in july 2008 a federal court agreed and ordered usda to open a new rulemaking to disclose the agencys true intentions while r calf usa fought to stop the otm rule departed directors and committee chairs formed a new organization to compete against r calf usa one committee chair also claimed ownership of r calf usas magazine when r calf usa learned about a plan to use the organizations confidential membership list to solicit members away from r calf usa and when confidential employee documents surfaced on the internet the r calf usa board of directors in fulfilling its fiduciary duties to the organization was compelled to file two lawsuits in state court to protect the proprietary information of its members and its organization the lawsuits initially worked r calf usas rights to its magazine were restored confidential employee documents were removed from the internet and r calf usas confidential membership list was protected by a court order prohibiting any unauthorized use recent decisions by the state court would make it difficult for r calf usa to obtain any further relief without pursuing a protracted appeal that could take years to resolve upon obtaining the july 2008 federal court decision on the otm rule that corrected the departed directors efforts to undermine r calf usas member established policy r calf usa had achieved the most important purposes of its pending lawsuit against its former directors and r calf usa remains well positioned in its ongoing legal challenge of the otm rule r calf usa has now offered to settle its lawsuit against the departed directors in full if the departed directors merely agree to return destroy or otherwise not use r calf usas confidential documents including its membership lists for any purpose as a result of this experience the r calf usa board of directors enacted new policies to ensure the protection of its members and employees confidential information as well as its confidential information concerning specific legal strategies
6656510 it is crucial for livestock producers to be engaged in shaping the final rule for cool we have an opportunity with the public comment period to close some loopholes in the agencys proposed rule
6656511 producers can do so by filing comments including suggested changes in the rule as well as stating their appreciation for provisions they support during a meeting with usda officials u s cattlemens association leadership learned that it is just as important to tell the agency what we like about the rule as well as what we want to see changed
6656512 will retailers and consumers ask for more information about the products involved under this provision

6656521 i dont think danny will be out to prove anything on saturday regarding the bolton aspect but he has got to prove himself to new supporters at st jamess park
6656522 we are monitoring a couple of situations but weve got no bids in
6656523 we will see how things go over the next week or so but im happy with the squad weve got
6656524 rio will be fine he knew he had a good chance of being captain and then the gaffer capello picked john terry so we all just get on with it now
6656525 rio has got a great attitude is a great footballer and i am sure he will take it in his stride and continue to do well for his country and united
6656526 i play alongside him every week so he would have been my choice but then the chelsea players would have said exactly the same about john terry
6656527 i was reading something from alan hansen during the summer and it really brought it home to me
6656528 you cant criticise much of what liverpool teams of the past did when hansen was playing obviously they were the best team around but it was interesting to read him say that sometimes liverpool won the league even though they didnt have a particularly great side
6656529 he went on to say that there is no possible way you could do that today it struck a chord with me and i thought it was a fair point
6656530 im not saying bad liverpool teams ever won the league of course they didnt but maybe a few years ago you could afford to carry a few players
6656531 i dont think thats possible now every position has got to be filled by a top player if you want to win things on a consistent basis
6656532 look at the other top sides in the premier league even the full back positions are filled with the best full backs in the world now
6656533 years ago you could probably get away with carrying the odd player here or there
6656534 it was good for me to hear that from someone who actually played back then rather than it coming from current players where itd probably just sound like an excuse
6656535 basically what hansen was saying was that its more difficult to win the league now than in his day
6656536 he has grown in stature over the last year since gary neville has been out injured
6656537 when he was at leeds i thought he was the leader bossing people about
6656538 but when he came to united with big personalities like neville he became a lot quieter and left it to other people
6656539 he has some quite considerable time left on the contract but hes been brilliant
6656540 when we signed him from watford we paid a lot of money for him but we didnt pay a lot of money to him and thats fine
6656541 he was a young kid and he was happy to do it
6656542 it was still a lot of money to pay for him but at the end of the day he might be worth three times that now its all relevant now he was voted in the pfa team and thats a big compliment the progress he has made in the time that he has been here is astounding
6656543 i had seen enough of him to know that he would come through
6656544 martin had his reasons and said it to my face that he didnt think i was good enough
6656545 he has done well in training in pre season and got a great goal at west ham hopefully it will be a great bit of business for us come the end of the season
6656546 the goal against spurs will give me confidence for the season and hopefully i can get more goals in the coming games
6656547 theres a lot of competition for places especially up front and all i can say is thats got to be good for the club
6656548 it was a massive boost for us to beat fulham
6656549 after three minutes we missed a great chance after eight minutes we were 1 0 down and after 20 minutes i thought it could be a really bad day because fulham were playing that well
6656550 to get an equaliser and go on to win with our fitness levels showed great character
6656551 but thats firmly behind us now its all about looking forward we came back in on monday and it was all about focusing on blackburn
6656552 we went into saturdays game fully expecting to get something from fulham and blackburn is another opportunity to get something
6656553 im not bothered about what other people think its more about what i think what the staff think and what the players think
6656554 we know what we are capable of and if we achieve that well be okay this season
6656555 its not particularly going brilliantly but were trying to get good players for the right price and that does take a little bit of time because people want to hang on to their players
6656556 well wait and see and if we can bring them in then all well and good but if not well go with what weve got now
6656557 you heard the fans i obviously have a very special relationship with them and ill always think very highly of the club
6656558 we have lost jo for quite some time now and he has not had a great deal of football recently either which is a concern for us
6656559 we send them away with our best wishes you do hope that while they are away that they will get good game time under his belt but he has not had a great deal of football in the time he has been away so hopefully he can hit the ground running
6656560 he has been in competitive games but going in for 10 15 minutes a time is not the ideal preparation for premier league games so it might take a little bit of time to get up to speed but needs must and i think he will be involved with us very very quickly
6656561 we hope that he will settle very quickly he has got the ability to and he will give us a presence up front which we lacked last weekend hes exceptional in the air and he will give us a bit extra
6656562 andys injury has improved immensely and hes quite close to full fitness clinically hes very close
6656563 due to the transfer taking a long time and everton not using him in pre season out of fear he might become injured he hasnt had much chance to get match fit
6656564 the chances are that we will use the three week period we have between arsenal and bolton to make sure we get him in tip top condition
6656565 im very concerned that the season has just begun and there are 38 matches to be played
6656566 its important for me to have andy up running and fit for most of those matches
6656567 i dont want to throw him in early because its the tempting thing to do
6656568 as often happens with these type of injuries the player gets back and theres a slight recurrence and he misses another couple of weeks
6656569 the season becomes very bitty and that would be a major error for the player and the club

6656654 who the hell can explain you karamazovs how can a man that realize he has acted despicably admit it and then continue acting in the same way
6656655 as he uttered the last word of his tirade miusov completely recovered his self complacency and all traces of his former irritation disappeared he fully and sincerely loved humanity again

6656661 historians will come to view aug 8 2008 as a turning point no less significant than nov 9 1989 when the berlin wall fell russias attack on sovereign georgian territory marked the official return of history indeed to an almost 19th century style of great power competition complete with virulent nationalisms battles for resources struggles over spheres of influence and territory and even though it shocks our 21st century sensibilities the use of military power to obtain geopolitical objectives
6656662 when a russo german deal is made you can be sure that the doom of the united states and great britain is on the horizon a german soviet agreement a second rapallo would be the greatest disaster which could befall the west

6656665 germany is conquering the balkans and russia has its eye on georgia
6656666 as these powers compete against each other watch for a new molotov ribbentrop pact to emerge it may be that dealings are already under way to conclude such an agreement
6656667 i believe it is very likely germany and russia have i believe germany may well have been
6656668 i f germany and russia make some sort of deal it will be open season on american influence in europe
6656669 t he clubs have not agreed in scotland it is not common that the clubs buy players for millions of euros apart from celtic and rangers sigma probably wanted too much money for me

6656675 and both are strong on the economy kerry in recent weeks though a strong obama supporter was outspoken against offshore drilling although obama has floated that he might consider it clinton likewise has shown herself not afraid to spar with obama or have a robust debate with him
6656676 in my opinion obama cant find a better vp candidate than john kerry
6656677 its difficult to go wire to wire at number one
6656678 there has been a reluctance on the part of government to fully accept responsibility for the treatment of children and young adults leading up to the closure of that mental institution

6656681 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6656682 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6656683 the russian georgia conflict has disrupted supplies and it looks like it will drag on and create a lot of uncertainty
6656684 everything i say is fully substantiated by my own opinion
6656685 think about how it will make a person feel when you say something
6656686 the social democratic model of a just and fair society with equal opportunities is as valid as it has been in the past
6656687 i have no doubt that we must be here i am also in shock but i tell you in good conscience that if we had to do it again i would do it again why are we here it is because here we play a part in the freedom of the world here we are fighting against terrorism

6656695 i think people will start to look a bit more carefully at david cameron there has been very little focus on him and the conservative party in recent months david cameron has done a very slick pr job in giving the tory message a new spin but the fact is that the substance of cameronism is no different from old conservatism

6656699 if anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me
6656700 if anyone intends to come after me let him deny himself forget ignore disown and lose sight of himself and his own interests and take up his cross and joining me as a disciple and siding with my party follow with me continually cleaving steadfastly to me
6656701 a disciple is one who follows ones teaching a disciple is not only a pupil but an adherent hence they are spoken of as imitators of their teacher
6656702 a real disciple of christ one who believes in the truth of the christian religion and studies to follow the example and obey the precepts of christ a believer in christ who is characterized by real piety
6656703 exercise of veneration and reverence fear of god in obedience to his will and devotion to his service

6656706 he who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he who0aloves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he who does not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me
6656707 if anyone comes to me and does not hate love less than him his father and mother wife and children brothers and sisters yes and his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple
6656708 let no one deceive you with empty words for because of these things the wrath of god comes upon the sons of disobedience
6656709 if anyone serves me he must follow me and where i am there my servant will be also if anyone serves me the father will honor him
6656710 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall anyone snatch them out of my hand

6656712 hooked new science on how casual sex is affecting our children
6656713 millions of american teenagers and young adults are finding that the psychological baggage of casual sex is affecting their lives
6656714 they are discovering that hooking up is the easy part but unhooking from a sexual relationship is a lot harder and can have serious consequences
6656715 if we identify specific demographics or factors that seem to directly contribute to these issues we will address those as we identify them even if they are only a slice of the problem
6656716 hopefully over time these interventions will decrease the rates of infection in our community
6656717 it is related to the number of sexual partners that one has
6656718 hooked new science on how casual sex is affecting our children

6656729 for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6656730 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates republican and democrat have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets
6656731 if post election the u s joins the kyoto system its involvement would take away the excuses for inaction from developing countries like china and india
6656732 i said to mr rudd that we view the further development of the single economic market on a bi partisan basis and if there was a change of government in new zealand then he could expect us to continue that work
6656733 if he wants to go i wont stand in his way he might want to take a break

6656766 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines
6656767 sleeping pills are also not the best way to solve underlying problems like depression or painful conditions that are interfering with a good nights sleep
6656768 most people know that coffee cola or black tea can interfere with their sleep
6656769 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep about 20 percent of adults in industrial countries have problems sleeping at one time or another the institute analysed scientific studies that cover a wide range of research on sleep and insomnia
6656770 trials have shown that many people could get to sleep a little sooner if they learned relaxation techniques to help them switch off when it is time to go to sleep
6656771 i think its degrading for us to hear that because thats not the way postal workers are
6656772 it goes all the way back to shootings in oklahoma city some years ago if you look in the dictionary its a very violent term
6656773 as far as going back to the violent shootings were not trying to belittle that or make fun of that in any kind of way
6656774 its just a whimsical name a franchise we bought into and i think were the farthest thing from being derogatory
6656775 i think its catchy it probably brings business its a good little slogan
6656776 you need a quick and effective way to produce calculations
6656777 this would involve use of leading publications material and staff like those of al arabi magazine and kuwait television and radio archives the channel would stress kuwaiti identity and present its folklore and traditions while catering to todays needs
6656778 theyre nicked up and its hard for them to get better when theyre not practicing but i am happy with the fact that weve got some young guys that are stepping up and showing that they can help us
6656779 its the first look weve had at him since he wasnt there for spring ball but hes doing a nice job
6656780 i cant always be the focal point of the offense and i think jeshua is going to be a big help and stretch the defense for us

6656783 we see a lot more value in meditation than in massages or wellness packs when meditating youre active which is the opposite of most other wellness applications
6656784 yoga is not only about moving the body but is also a form of self recognition that integrates breathing and body awareness with the intellect or spirit of the body
6656785 in yoga we train the physical condition for meditation through asanas which is a yoga body position
6656786 in the end the point is to let everything go
6656787 meditation is something that when starting out you just have to get used to but its not something you should feel forced to do its counterproductive to do it with iron discipline for two hours a day
6656788 i can understand the essence of life within two minutes or i can take 20 years or more and still not understand
6656789 in this area we must balance all reasonable conclusions with evidence that is backed up by proper statistical studies personally when i want to structure an argument regarding baseball betting i look to the studies and conclusions of hui doukas who was a pioneer in the field and highly regarded statistician
6656790 its been a good week the players have looked good and bright and we go into round two in a very positive frame of mind
6656791 but there is honesty and reality around the team that we can do better and we will do better it was good to get the season under way but we know we can do more right around the park and well be looking to do exactly that against melbourne while the performance against queensland wasnt where we wanted it to be in its entirety there were times we got the ball into good areas and the goal by shane smeltz was a good one
6656792 we lacked a little bit of cohesion last weekend and if we can secure more of the ball in that middle third of the pitch against melbourne then we give ourselves much more of a chance once we get at them get the ball into the flank areas and utilise the pace of our players then we can cause them some problems just as we did in the final
6656793 we might play slightly differently to what we did against queensland with a bit of a tweak in formation to get more support forward into advance positions
6656794 i think the front third can be a lot more exciting than what we saw last weekend fortunately weve got depth and quality this season and if we dont have leo and leilei available then there are chances for other players thats the desire i want to see around the club and at the weekend
6656795 we were disappointing in the first game of the season and that had a lot to do with some nerves in front of the home crowd and trying to do a little too much but we know were a good team and were going to stick to our gameplan and show what were capable of
6656796 what was very positive last weekend was the character we showed to hit back pretty quickly after they scored and the conviction within the squad this week that we mustnt be that disappointing again
6656797 each one of us as the citizens of this country must now ask are we going to be bullied and pressured into doing things that are clearly not in our national interest
6656798 if we succumb to such pressures what next what will that do to our self worth as an independent nation
6656799 fijis people need to realise that in going forward as a nation we may have to paddle our canoes on our own
6656800 we dont expect the situation to deteriorate but we would be remiss in our duty not have a plan in place in the event the situation did deteriorate
6656801 if however the airport at nadi was closed then we would have to consider whether a military evacuation by air or by sea was necessary
6656802 we would work with what ever government was in place in fiji to try to get their concurrence if that was not possible then in the last instance the lives and the well being of our citizens would be paramount and we would do it with or without that concurrence

6656813 were trying to make it not necessarily a rebuilding year because we want our seniors to go out on a good note
6656814 the quicker we go through and learn it the better
6656815 shell be able to contribute its a higher level though
6656816 last year wsu went through some rough patches where they were in close games and couldnt finish very well
6656817 we have a good core group here and we want to play and compete
6656818 the list will concentrate no 1 on all of the people who made it happen
6656819 there are these scenes in rodanthe and you just get the wind swept austere beauty of the outer banks
6656820 its co mingled with a story that im proud to have written and that translated well to film
6656821 its not often you have a movie named after the place that it actually was filmed so weve got a lot of opportunities
6656822 they hit our target market they showcase our incredible island
6656823 that we cant afford to be in on our own
6656824 we are all excited for the game and we are anxious to play someone besides ourselves
6656825 player for player we are probably more talented than we have been in previous years but how those mesh together that remains to be seen but if i had to go on early indications i think we have got the talent to compete with anybody
6656826 the exciting thing is that lindsay parlee showed that she can step in and had a great year last year its just that she played behind a player of brynns caliber stephanie phillips comes from a program that is used to winning and being on a big stage so that competition has been fun to watch
6656827 i am sorry for what i did that 25 year old man i dont think he appreciated the life he was taking that this was a human being i feel now at 53 that i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is
6656828 for my consciences sake i felt the lord had told me to plead guilty at that time and i did

6656833 we will miss him forever its always easier to leave than to be left
6656834 we appreciate yall being here it has not been a good day for us but theres nobody id rather be with than all my family up here on the stage
6656835 back in the early days i always had a little smoke and fire not only for misdirection but to emphasize that something magic had just happened
6656836 but as the magic and magician mature you see that you dont need the bigger props
6656837 a team of brain scientists and prominent magicians described how magic tricks both simple and spectacular take advantages of glitches in how the brain constructs a model of the outside world from moment to moment or what we think of as objective reality
6656838 the brain builds representations of the world moment to moment using the senses to provide clues that are fleshed out into a mental picture based on experience and context
6656839 what to see and what to let pass magic exposes the inseams the neural stitching in the perceptual curtain
6656840 conscious attention on one thing at a time at the expense of others regardless of where the eyes are pointing
6656841 small apparently trivial movements can mask maneuvers that produce breathtaking effects
6656842 if the audience is made to read intention getting the pencil in this case then that action disappears and no one remembers you put your hand in your pocket
6656843 pheaa created an elite compensation for its executive staff that included excessive salaries and incentive payments not typical of a state agency
6656844 there were nine people in pheaa who made more than the governor
6656845 this put them under scrutiny theyve never been under before we have not looked at the sallie maes of the world we dont know how they function i cant in a factual concrete way weigh into the comparison with a private entity
6656846 but i know there was a proposal by sallie mae to buy pheaa for about a billion dollars a couple of years ago
6656847 obviously with all the economic issues the student loan business has encountered it appears that would not have been a good decision
6656848 seems to feel it can survive as an independent franchise
6656849 we agree that the company should be able to survive through the credit cycle
6656850 work through some of the biggest problems in hopes of getting a better price for the franchise once there is stabilization and rebound

6656862 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6656863 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6656864 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6656865 if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6656866 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6656867 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6656868 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6656869 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6656870 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here

6656881 it is a very hard moment i am asking myself what happened
6656882 he has no real identity he is half white which he rejects the rest of him is mostly arab which he hides but is disclosed by his non african arabic surname and his arabic first and middle names as a way to triply proclaim his arabic parentage to people in kenya only a small part of him is african black from his luo grandmother but he pretends he is luo exclusively

6656884 let that sink in obama is not the descendant of slaves he is the descendant of slave owners thus he makes the perfect liberal messiah

6656913 sex is a sacred thing it is not simply biological it is closely related to society family and religion so firstly morality should be taught otherwise it will create sexual anarchy in the state

6656919 today we practiced a little like it was a monday practice which means we started some primary preparations for our first game of the season against clemson i think the biggest thing we are trying to get our players to learn to do is how to prepare for a game everybody on the team has a role for preparation for a game

6656961 jimmy carters long history of anti israel bias has rendered him unfit to address the democratic convention it is incumbent upon the democratic party leadership and senator obama to remove carter from the program in denver the democratic party and senator obamas continued embrace of carter and his anti israel bias sends a troubling message to the jewish community it stands in stark contrast to the gop and john mccains pro israel stance

6657027 sejak 1 juni 2005 sampai 20 agustus 2008 kita telah melaksanakan 414 pilkada baik pemilihan gubernur maupun bupati walikota dan proses ini berjalan terus di akhir tahun 2008 seluruh gubernur bupati dan walikota di indonesia akan sudah terpilih secara langsung oleh konstituen di daerah mereka sendiri hal ini secara otomatis mengubah peta politik indonesia dan mengubah dinamika politik nasional ke arah yang lebih akuntabel dan demokratis
6657028 kita semua menyambut gembira keikutsertaan calon perseorangan dalam proses demokratisasi di daerah mulai tahun 2008 ini merupakan tonggak penting bagi peningkatan perluasan partisipasi politik masyarakat sekaligus merupakan tantangan bagi partai politik untuk menyiapkan kader kadernya yang berkualitas untuk bersaing dengan calon perseorangan kita berharap perluasan partisipasi politik ini pada akhirnya dapat meningkatkan kualitas kepemimpinan pemerintah di daerah
6657029 dengan desentralisasi dan otonomi daerah sebagian kewenangan sudah diserahkan kepada daerah baik pada pemerintah provinsi maupun pada pemerintah kabupaten dan kota
6657030 pemahaman ini diperlukan agar masyarakat dapat memahami kemana suatu kebijakan pemerintahan harus dipertanggungjawaban sehingga tidak perlu terjadi permasalahan pada tingkat daerah dibawa masyarakat ke tingkat pusat termasuk sering terjadinya kegiatan unjuk rasa yang salah alamat dan salah sasaran meskipun tetap kami terima
6657031 besarnya dana apbn yang dialokasikan ke daerah membuktikan komitmen kita semua untuk menjalankan desentralisasi dan otonomi secara konsisten dan bertanggungjawab
6657032 oleh karena itu saya perlu mengingatkan dan menekankan bahwa daerahlah yang sekarang menjadi ujung tombak pembangunan daerahlah yang berada di paling depan untuk peningkatan kemakmuran rakyat kita harus memastikan bahwa anggaran yang semakin besar ini tidak diikuti dengan semakin meningkatnya penyimpangan apalagi korupsi di daerah saya ingin menegaskan sekali lagi bahwa tidak ada toleransi bagi kejahatan korupsi di pusat maupun daerah apbn dan apbd adalah uang rakyat yang harus dimanfaatkan untuk kepentingan dan kesejahteraaan rakyat
6657033 sungguh baik jika hal yang sama dilakukan di daerah para pemimpin daerah harus menghilangkan hambatan investasi untuk dapat mendorong pertumbuhan ekonomi dan menciptakan lapangan kerja

6657089 its an honor to be named the starter especially after what nate has done at cal
6657090 i feel like seawright has a great upside with his leg strength once he got his bearings hes been very consistent and gives us a little more range
6657091 we probably wont know the starters until game time when we see what the game plan will be
6657092 there will probably be a broader rotation than weve ever had with the receivers

6657121 seeding wines is an abomination whatever the argument there is no merit to it and it makes no sense this approach is nothing else but a devious mechanism to favour and preclude pre determined nominated wines from scrupulous assessment it obviously prevents wine judges from expressing their views for the sake of informing the consumer public on the real and true standing of any wine by implication it protects weak wine judgment decisions it makes a mockery of the principle of wine competitions which in case nobody has noticed goes about wineries actually competing through their wines and which must be conducted in a fair and objective manner with a level playground applying to al participants and it places a huge question mark on the integrity of any accolade awarded in such dubious fashion an outstanding wine can only be nominated through impartial that is unsighted evaluation

6657163 each one of us as the citizens of this country must now ask are we going to be bullied and pressured into doing things that are clearly not in our national interest
6657164 if we succumb to such pressures what next what will that do to our self worth as an independent nation
6657165 fijis people need to realise that in going forward as a nation we may have to paddle our canoes on our own
6657166 we dont expect the situation to deteriorate but we would be remiss in our duty not have a plan in place in the event the situation did deteriorate
6657167 if however the airport at nadi was closed then we would have to consider whether a military evacuation by air or by sea was necessary

6657170 high fructose corn syrup hfcs is produced by processing corn starch to yield glucose and then processing the glucose to produce a high percentage of fructose
6657171 first cornstarch is treated with alpha amylase to produce shorter chains of sugars called polysaccharides alpha amylase is industrially produced by a bacterium usually
6657172 next an enzyme called glucoamylase breaks the sugar chains down even further to yield the simple sugar glucose unlike alpha amylase glucoamylase is produced by
6657173 there are two more steps involved first is a liquid chromatography step that takes the mixture to 90 percent fructose finally this is back blended with the original mixture to yield a final concentration of about 55 percent fructose what the industry calls high fructose corn syrup

6657176 we see epidemics of nutrition related diseases at this point in time and theyre largely most severe among people who have recently been displaced from their home ground like yemeni and ethiopian jews with high incidences of diabetes now that theyre eating an ashkenazi diet in israel or theyre folks like the navajo here in the southwest who havent been physically displaced from their homeland but an entirely different diet has been brought in since world war ii no diabetes among these people prior to wwii and now they have the highest incidences of diabetes in the world

6657183 i actually grew up with exotic animals like llamas reindeer axis deer and fallow deer i also had peacocks we had a blue indian peafowl which is a pair if you have a pair or you dont know the sex you call it a peafowl and if its a male you call it a peacock
6657184 i started with two market lambs that we went and bought and i showed them at the fair three years ago then i thought id try chickens thats something i never grew up with i showed chickens last year and this year im showing fancy chickens market chickens and goats
6657185 we went all the way to coldwater to look at some goats and these two were the best ones we had seen we bought them but we didnt have a trailer so we threw them in the back of the chevy trailblazer that was interesting its a good thing we didnt drive my convertible that day
6657186 i joined last year because i had heard its a really good program and i really like it i was even able to tell mr elwer and mrs bambauer some things about exotics and they taught me about chickens and goats they taught me to walk lambs a lot because their legs are where you make more money at auction and they taught me how to bathe chickens thats interesting i always end up needing a shower myself
6657187 this is a tremendous accomplishment she really works hard with her goat which is a new project for our chapter and were excited that she did so well we commend her for spending so much time on her animals because thats what it takes the time at home to get the job done and she does a tremendous job

6657191 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
6657192 there have been many attempts to prevent vap most of which have revolved around modifying hospital practices the silver coated endotracheal tube has an advantage in that it doesnt require any additional effort by nurses therapists and doctors who may already be over burdened
6657193 i think this is just the beginning for this kind of technology the silver polymer coating will most likely be applied also to tracheostomy tubes and also become available for use in pediatric medicine in the future we could see other types of coatings with other functions placed on devices that come into contact with the body

6657206 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to
6657207 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6657208 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6657209 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too

6657308 they have been put in custody under successive remands i think the court gave remand under five or six charges the court gave two weeks for judicial custody in each remand the accused have the right to present to the judge what they want to in these remands given inside the prison compound they were denied these rights the court could not examine and question the accused while we could not ask anything to the judge
6657309 the arrests of these student leaders were made unlawfully and then they were deprived of their lawful rights in the prison including medical care the government is doing what they should not do
6657310 it reveals lack of the rule of law in burma they fought for democracy and human rights in the 1988 popular uprising they have served long prison terms before now they have again been arrested for their struggle for democracy human rights and for protesting against rising commodity prices we pay our heartfelt respect to them for standing by the people they are role models for the next generation of students
6657311 the student leaders have already suffered various diseases during their previous lengthy prison terms before being arrested again last year my elder brothers chief complaint is indigestion he is trying his best to prevent his disease from worsening hes having only gruel in prison instead of rice
6657312 no ones health is in good shape in prison the prosecution has been constantly changing the charges leveled against them since their arrest the last time he was charged under in the foreign currency case under section 24 1 of foreign currency exchange act min ko naing is suffering from eye hypertension high blood pressure heart ailment and bone diseases
6657313 a concern would be the kicking game in particular coach mike nolan said
6657314 our coverage units have not been very good that last couple of weeks
6657315 special teams was an area that was very strong for us a year ago probably the best in the league nolan said
6657316 it hasnt been strong the last few weeks so we need to correct those things
6657317 this is a loss for the entire nfl gene was the epitome of what the nfl stands for he was not only a man who gave his very best on the field every game during his great career but he was a man of integrity and service off the field
6657318 it was very shocking news to the profession to us as players its very disappointing to hear because of all the things hes done over the years and the way hes represented us
6657319 im dying to know who it is said the tight end davis who praised all three quarterbacks
6657320 the nice thing is i know im capable of so much more in this system smith said referring to offensive coordinator mike martz
6657321 the frustrating thing is that there are a couple of plays you wish you could have back
6657322 my responsibility is to get better every day and continue to grow i dont think that changes no matter what they decide
6657323 we can dominate anybody if we go out there with the right game plan which im pretty sure well have davis said

6657338 this ranking reflects the high academic standards and commitment to excellence that is a hallmark of jesuit education globally for over 400 years
6657339 were pleased that u s news recognizes the dedication of our faculty and administrators who year after year provide excellent educational opportunities to our students daily
6657340 on behalf of the clergy religious and faithful parishioners of the diocese of wheeling charleston i congratulate wheeling jesuit university for distinguished recognition in the recent u s news amp world report survey on higher education
6657341 under the guidance of the universitys president the rev julio giulietti s j wjus faculty and staff continue to find new ways to deliver a quality 21st century education in the finest catholic jesuit tradition
6657342 wju is a celebrated institution and a key asset to the city
6657343 by setting these high standards we are able to attract young people from many different cities to come to wheeling which is vital to our progress we are very proud of our citys name sake university and all it does for the local community
6657344 i am sure the tickets will go pretty fast so anyone who wants them should come to our office or call early
6657345 if someone is having a true emergency in the city of wheeling they should go to wheeling hospital or ovmc because those are the closest hospitals
6657346 my objective is to make sure the citizens of wheeling have access to an ambulance at all times
6657347 i know of one particular time when squad 1 ambulance went to east ohio regional while they were over there they got a call for service on wheeling island but they couldnt get there because of a train crossing in front of the bridge
6657348 we had to stop this because someone was eventually going to be stuck without an ambulance
6657349 if i am in pittsburgh i am not going to expect the people up there to bring me back to wheeling to go to the hospital
6657350 as long as they are meeting the medical needs of the patient the city can set rules for things such as this
6657351 because less than 1 percent of our calls in 2007 went outside the city limits this should not be that big of an adjustment
6657352 i dont think there are too many people in wheeling who would be going across the river to go to the hospital
6657353 i would not anticipate that any decision made by the city of wheeling would have much of an impact on east ohio regional
6657354 bluefield has done everything they can to hire a pharmacist
6657355 there are eight clinics in west virginia that will not survive
6657356 our legislature when they implemented this truly did not think this would hurt free clinics
6657357 i think its a matter of sitting down with the board of pharmacy and the legislators
6657358 it is unrealistic to assume that enough pharmacists are available and able to volunteer at our charitable clinics to have a pharmacist at the clinics during normal hours of operation
6657359 it is even more unrealistic to think these free clinics could afford to hire pharmacists to staff the clinics
6657360 you shouldnt regard this as some kind of formal investigation but yes we have asked the gymastics federation to look into what have been number of questions and apparent discrepencies on this subject
6657361 they are working with the national federation who have been extremely helpful so we can have a full clarification on this topic
6657362 confirmation from the international olympic committee that all passports are valid for all gymnasts competing in the beijing olympic games
6657363 as we stand here i still absolutely believe that my client is innocent
6657364 why is it that every child that comes into contact with him is broken
6657365 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children
6657366 i thought things would go the justice way but justice is fickle i guess
6657367 i honestly dont know why it went the way it did this is the first time ive heard all this stuff that the d a is putting out that is not my child
6657368 nu kan dat enkel na een rechterlijke beslissing daardoor lopen we telkens achter de feiten aan
6657369 er is nood aan een wettelijk initiatief met een lijst van misdrijven waarvoor we websites in ons land mogen censureren

6657372 just breathe is tender and heartbreaking the story of what happens when you lose what you thought was love but susan wiggs looks deeper and follows her character to something so much better the discovery of her own true heart and her real true love its a beautiful novel
6657373 the kane county health department will be conducting an on site inspection of the walter paytons roundhouse after several complaints about flies within the meals
6657374 please stay away until the kane county health department issues their official findings
6657375 quickly deemed to be an inappropriate use of city e mail
6657376 the city does not adopt endorse or approve of the e mail the employee did not collect the information alleged in the e mail and send the e mail at the request of the city but acted on his own
6657377 the contents of the e mail are solely attributable to the sender and not the city furthermore the city did not authorize the employee to speak on its behalf with regards to this matter and the employee did not speak on behalf of the city
6657378 we are not in the habit of making presumptions until we have gathered all of our facts
6657379 everything surrounding mr maysonet and his employment remains status quo
6657380 while i sent the e mail from my city of aurora e mail address during the workday i did not act as a city employee in doing so and did not intend to make it appear that way i sent the e mail as an individual and the thoughts and words of the message are mine alone
6657381 no one at the city gave me permission to send the e mail and i did not receive permission after the fact for sending it i apologize if it appeared that the city issued a health warning for the roundhouse because i did not intend for that to happen
6657382 i cant believe hes still employed but as long as the city keeps him on im going to assume they endorse his actions
6657383 walter paytons name is on this restaurant and we keep it there with as much respect as it deserves for this guy to talk about walter paytons roundhouse like that thats where i draw the line
6657384 my attorneys are involved and i intend to pursue this as far as i can
6657385 i think the guy didnt like the barbecue sauce dressing combination he created on the salad and tried to give it back so we comped it
6657386 but he became rude and made quite a scene when we wouldnt refund him for the burger that he finished
6657387 the inspectors notes found fewer than 10 fruit flies in the bar area and confirmed the establishment has regular pest control services
6657388 ultimately the roundhouse received a score of 90 which is considered a very good score
6657389 the rustic and rural character of the ettamogah pub and aussie world would be enhanced
6657390 village as australias largest and most successful theme park owner operator has the resources to continually reinvest in wet n wild aussie world
6657391 wij analyseren onafgebroken al onze kostenplaatsen we gaan na hoe we kunnen besparen zonder daarbij de kwaliteit van onze productie uit het oog te verliezen
6657392 in general we appreciate tsa support for security of aircraft
6657393 but its quite obvious this inspector was not properly trained
6657394 its fortunate for him the aircraft had not recently been operating
6657395 i think thats probably realistic we have to win all our games if we want to make the eight
6657396 you cant get too far ahead of yourselves and if we dont win this saturday our seasons over its all finished
6657397 theres still a long way to go and at the moment were coming 12th so weve got a lot of work to do
6657398 theres obviously a lot of expectation on us as a club
6657399 parramatta they have a lot of supporters and seem to get a lot of criticism in the media at the moment
6657400 no matter if were winning or losing people sort of want to criticise us but thats all well and good
6657401 our fans expect a lot of us and they tend to be pretty harsh on us at times
6657402 but we expect a lot of ourselves as well and were disappointed with our season but at the moment were still in there with a chance
6657403 theres a bit of excitement building now and weve got a little momentum over the last couple of weeks but weve got to keep that going
6657404 we saw it ourselves we were very low with our confidence and we were playing poorly but it only takes one week to turn it around
6657405 that means the bus can travel as far as gurnee and libertyville for people who have doctor appointments there
6657406 it was such a great deal that we just couldnt pass it up
6657407 we are planning on putting in a schedule of sorts where the bus will head to condell medical center in libertyville one day then to northern illinois medical center in mchenry one day to help out the seniors who need to go to the doctor
6657408 we are also looking for and applying for grants to offset the cost of operating the bus five days a week rather than just three days
6657409 basically if the fox lake shuttle service goes to dominicks or jewel for groceries then theres no reason why we should follow the same route
6657410 but there are plenty of places to go in the township that other buses do not go
6657411 its just another way for residents in need of transportation in the township to get around
6657412 i think the group is going to honor four or five other citizens and its an independent group not using public funds they invited me and i said fine i think they used me as kind of a marquee name to get this thing going looks like a lot of people are going to show up
6657413 deutschlands engagement f r die territoriale integrit t georgiens zu betonen und einen russischen truppenabzug zu fordern
6657414 es muss eine selbstverst ndlichkeit sein dass sicherheit auch trotz der hohen kerosinkosten der airlines auf der agenda ganz oben bleibt
6657415 das hei t alle mitgliedsfluglinien unterliegen strengsten sicherheitsbedingungen denn bei einem unfall wird nicht nur die betroffene fluglinie sondern die ganze allianz in misskredit gebracht
6657416 es wird alles getan um festzustellen was die ursachen der katastrophe waren und wer daf r verantwortlich war
6657417 wir haben hinweise von den zust ndigen spanischen beh rden dass sich vier deutsche unter den todesopfern befinden diese angaben stehen unter dem vorbehalt der endg ltigen identifizierung der opfer
6657418 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6657419 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6657420 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6657421 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6657422 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6657423 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6657424 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6657425 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6657426 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6657427 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6657428 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6657429 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6657430 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6657431 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6657432 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6657433 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6657434 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6657435 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6657436 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6657437 het is een logische ontwikkeling dat er meer interesse komt vanuit china om in ons te investeren
6657438 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6657439 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6657440 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6657441 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6657442 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6657443 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6657444 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6657445 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6657446 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6657447 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6657448 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6657449 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6657450 who are open to doing something on the production side
6657451 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6657452 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6657453 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6657454 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6657455 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6657456 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6657457 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6657458 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6657459 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6657460 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6657461 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6657462 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6657463 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6657464 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6657465 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6657466 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6657467 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6657468 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6657469 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6657470 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6657471 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6657472 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6657473 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6657474 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6657475 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6657476 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6657477 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6657478 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6657479 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6657480 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6657481 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6657482 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6657483 it gives us a chance to have fun together an important component of being a family of faith
6657484 we like to welcome everyone it enriches who we are and lets them know about who we are
6657485 the pharaoh is an elvis impersonator ive never done that in my life
6657486 i get to use a french accent and im sure im butchering it terribly
6657487 theyve noticed im probably a ham and could pull it off
6657488 he was very forward thinking and he really worked to build community
6657489 he was really dynamic and so invested in the building faith campaign
6657490 he had so much energy and this great sense of humor that he drew people to him
6657491 through the sacraments of baptism and all the marriages and funerals he will be greatly missed
6657492 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6657493 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6657494 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6657495 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6657496 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6657497 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6657498 my mom couldnt control me i had so much energy that my parents decided to take me to this school
6657499 she is the real deal and she is wonderful to work with
6657500 we are a more technically driven school at state street she brings it exactly where ive always wanted it to go
6657501 most kids they just do it for fun but even if you do it for fun i think its important that you know what youre doing and that you know it well
6657502 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6657503 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6657504 these moms are worried but theyre just so proud of their kids who are willing to fight for their country it brings a sense of pride not many can understand
6657505 i havent done it before and ive been training to do it for the last 10 years the hardest part of deployment is leaving your family
6657506 rhondas been through deployments before she handles them pretty well
6657507 we want to let them know were behind the group 100 percent
6657508 were just there to help out and be available if families need help
6657509 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6657510 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

6657515 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6657516 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6657517 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6657531 the board has made a lot of changes in the past four years
6657532 weve implemented schedule changes tightened and toughened up policies on cell phones electronic devices and attendance and we are looking for a leader who can hit the ground running
6657533 i think in any district youd be in theres more than enough work to be done and this district is no exception
6657534 there have been very few days where i havent looked forward to going to work
6657535 almost every one of them will transfer to somewhere else
6657536 i feel so bad for these families that are going to be faced with these kinds of decisions what do you do
6657537 the best available option for the department at this time is to close pontiac
6657538 pontiac and this state have had a wonderful partnership for more than 130 years
6657539 i look around and see everything that we do have
6657540 you know weve worked hard the last 20 years how would we ever start over
6657541 i dont look at what blagojevich says any more i look at what he does
6657542 the only thing that can save the prison right now is when the guy signs the piece of paper that says its no longer going to close

6657550 as a board im not sure this is the right time to do this
6657551 theres no question in my mind we need additional office space but before going forward with a boardroom it ought to be as plain and simple and inexpensive as can be
6657552 get well and stay well while you are in the hospital
6657553 this isnt a research based decision its a budget based one
6657554 pulling our aides is opening the door for the district to keep taking from this successful program
6657555 as we were looking through our budget processes and staffing reviews we saw that this did not meet the standard of a 27 to 1 student teacher ratio for bilingual programs
6657556 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms

6657560 they will put the pressure on their legislators with campaign contributions
6657561 they will mount a campaign against us like no tomorrow
6657562 comed is opposed to the bill and that opposition is based on the fact that it would allow some customers free access to the transmission and distribution system
6657563 comed would still be able to charge them for maintenance
6657564 im willing to amend the bill if we need to address that issue
6657565 we tried with comed and it didnt work out so were going to go this route
6657566 im going to do whatever i can to make sure this gets out of the house
6657567 now we just put our boxing gloves on and go at it
6657568 not only are you going to save on energy costs governments should be allowed to reduce enough electricity to cover all the costs of government administrative costs as well
6657569 when you have the economics of this behind you victory is all but inevitable
6657570 once the darn thing is paid for were looking at a reduction to our operating cost
6657571 its a positive way for school districts to reduce their operating expenses so less money goes to electricity and more money goes to education
6657572 there are a lot of scare cards on the turn that i can win the pot with and also at that time i thought my table image was good
6657573 with jamie in there i kind of thought i could win that hand regardless my particular table image to jamie is probably that he thinks im not putting my chips in bad so i can manipulate certain situations that i need to board permitting
6657574 i know i have to call fast because i know dicken has a piece of it
6657575 i know he doesnt have the three 9s i know hes not going to be able to overcall

6657577 one thing was the rule of female sports you dont have to be best friends thats a big statement
6657578 theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves
6657579 by saying what i said i put a lot of pressure on myself right
6657580 we were very sure about it we dominated but we didnt make it
6657581 it is a very hard moment i am asking myself what happened
6657582 from the knee to the ankle area covered in bites
6657583 americans haven t quite decided which of these iraq narratives they prefer which is why the presidential race is essentially a tie
6657584 there are many things that become a story because ive been fortunate enough to have people following me since very early in my indycar career
6657585 if im having good weekend they notice patrick said of the public
6657586 and if im having a bad weekend they want to know what happened i just have to be conscious of that i just have to be aware that people are always watching
6657587 i asked the county board to give me an opportunity to build a domestic violence court facility that is centrally located and that separates victims from perpetrators the minute they get to the courthouse
6657588 were interested in getting the word out that theyre not going to be standing alone
6657589 re examine operations at 555 w harrison street to ensure that the circuit court of cook county remains on the cutting edge in providing a safe and secure environment for the hearing of domestic violence matters
6657590 if i have to ask for more money ill do that

6657592 i was a pretty good athlete i would do sports with them in order to make them more cooperative i would take some of the people out for dinner at a restaurant in town in civilian clothes
6657593 it took quite some time before he was willing to cooperate the war had ended in europe and at that point he said hes willing to help us but his wife was at that point in what was in the russian zone
6657594 we told the sales person what size and so on and the woman held up a pair of panties
6657595 that should be long so as to cover their legs
6657596 i dont know how hes alive and neither does anybody else lying on your back after not eating and being in the pouring rain for so many days
6657597 how he was able to keep his mind alert and stay alive is absolutely incredible

6657602 these jackoffs seem to think life is some stupid video game where everybody is or should be armed
6657603 i swear to the mother of baal you cant make up stuff this bad its like the self congratulation and the self contradiction are competing with each other
6657604 the two that we chose were heavily involved in the community they both had very strong interpersonal skills and shared a passion for activism
6657605 theres a history of housing segregation in illinois that has created a pattern of minorities living together in poorer areas and whites living together in wealthier areas
6657606 the process of school funding reform must be undertaken in a legislative forum rather than in the courts
6657607 there are new approaches that can be taken which is what i believe the chicago urban league is trying to do
6657608 its better of course for the elected representatives of the people to bring about this change but many courts around the country have done it
6657609 the tax swap proposals weve seen so far look like they would cause us to lose resources

6657612 human beings can be silly because we move away from things too quickly in this country
6657613 thats very evident in places like san francisco which never got rid of its streetcar system
6657614 it looks like its going to take you somewhere but its only designed to support downtown residents
6657615 if officials fall for the hype and dont ask the hard questions voters should vote them out
6657616 one happy consequence will be that streetcar customers who live in the area will be less mobile by choice
6657617 in years gone by people would move to cities to get a job
6657618 today young educated workers move to cities with a sense of place and if businesses see us laying rail down on a street theyll know thats a permanent route that will have people passing by seven days a week
6657619 we have to compete for talent and for place of national prominence
6657620 it is directly tied to economic development and when times are tough in ohio we need an additional tool to create jobs
6657621 i believe in 10 years we would ask why didnt we do this it will be 10 times more expensive and the cost of gas will be unaffordable
6657622 that is no way to do things in the 21st century
6657623 the precedent of kosovo is a terrible precedent which will de facto blow apart the whole system of international relations developed not over decades but over centuries
6657624 they have not thought through the results of what they are doing at the end of the day it is a two ended stick and the second end will come back and hit them in the face
6657625 georgians are a melodramatic people and few more so than their hyperactive president
6657626 we killed as many of them as we could but where are our friends
6657627 responsible in the name of his government for two controversial regions abkhazia and south ossetia he ignores the fact that the inhabitants of these areas do not want to be part of his country
6657628 is also how israel responded to another provocation the killing and abduction of israeli soldiers by hezbollah this is how countries including freer and more democratic ones than russia respond to provocations
6657629 israel might pay a heavy price for the drones and training by israel ziv and gal hirsch our new mercenaries in georgia
6657630 can highlight his desire to cooperate more closely with the united states on anti missile defense in order to remove the threat of blackmail which even a weak and distant army can pose to either state
6657631 prime minister netanyahu can formulate the policies and stress themes he favors in language familiar to the americans by tapping into themes of american administrations during the cold war which apply well to israel if israel wants to test certain propositions that require a benign american reaction then the best time to do so is before november 1996

6657642 i dont like them so i try not to talk to them as much as possible hornbuckle said
6657643 she would call me every day three times a day bobbitt said
6657644 we were all such good friends in college but the wnba is a lot different said anosike who plays for the minnesota lynx
6657645 people have lives of their own and lives outside of basketball whereas at tennessee our life was pretty much school and basketball
6657646 i look back at that situation and i really miss it and cherish it i try to keep in touch with alex and me and shannon had dinner when she came to play in minnesota and i talked on the phone with ut coach pat summitt a few times
6657647 the difference now is you have so many games in row
6657648 you have back to backs youre traveling its a lot different from college here youve got to be ready to bounce back you might have a game that goes into overtime one night and youre flying right into the next city the next morning for another game
6657649 during our rookie orientation we heard from a lot of the great players in the wnba like stacy dales who recently retired and she told us you really dont have time to get down on yourself after a loss because number one its not that horrible when you lose
6657650 in the wnba youre losing but so is everyone else so you kind of have to look at it that way
6657651 my living conditions are pretty good but the traveling is hard bobbitt said
6657652 im not used to going through security at the airport or having to wait in lines at restaurants im used to being spoiled like i was at the university of tennessee
6657653 here its more of a job setting i miss that college feel
6657654 coach bill laimbeer and assistant coach rick mahorn do a great job of giving us the days off that we need to allow our bodies to rest hornbuckle said
6657655 everything is just kind of on your own and i kind of like that i like to sleep in my free time so to not have to go to tutoring or night class that feels real good
6657656 we realized that we were on opposite ends now and it was just a matter of two great teams going at it bobbitt said
6657657 we knew it was going to be physical and it just got out of hand a little bit
6657658 hi how are you today be careful crossing the road
6657659 excuse me manley i need to go in the kitchen
6657660 little dog youve got to get out of my house if sophie sees you he will whip your ass all over the place and i just swept this floor
6657661 i spoke with them this morning and they have increased their offer from 3 percent to 6 percent of an increase
6657662 im hoping 6 percent is something the council would be supportive of
6657663 i think 6 percent is somewhat of a fair offer but we do need more information on what our current energy costs are at the courthouse to determine if its an adequate enough increase
6657664 these couple of kids forced us to be a district in need of improvement
6657665 by them not participating in this case they were participating
6657666 this is not what no child left behind is about its about students making progress and weve made progress
6657667 pick his hand up and make a mark in the book
6657668 it just puts a lot of oversight on us a lot more staff time developing a plan instead of working with students
6657669 it is some of the stigma of being a district in need of improvement
6657670 it is always shocking to meet life where we thought we were alone look out we cry its alive and therefore this is the point at which so many draw back i would have done so myself if i could and proceed no further with christianity
6657671 we have to understand were not trying to play a basketball game next week or in a month
6657672 she didnt feel good when she was cutting summitt said
6657673 look at the players we can bring off the bench im mean its crazy tamika catching seimone augustus fowles and candace parker youre kidding me so we feel like we can bring our second wave of players and third wave of players
6657674 a lot of times when the reserves come in that is when the game breaks open
6657675 its not always because the first five isnt doing a great job its because thats when the fatigue sets in for the other team
6657676 she comes in there with three or four people around her and just reaches up grabs the ball and puts it in
6657677 we talked about the depth of this team from the beginning
6657678 its like our starting five is in the playing with energy and then when subs come in it never goes away in fact it picks up
6657679 they did a very good job of picking the 12 players that they did
6657680 when you can call anybody off the bench and they come bring it in for you i think its great its up to us to utilize our depth well
6657681 we dont have to have anybody worn out by playing 25 or 30 minutes the coaches get every ounce from everybody and we are not going to overuse anybody
6657682 the scary thing about them is that they have players with tremendous ability their front line is something to contend with
6657683 i wanna fuck you fuck you you already know i wanna fuck you you already know ooh
6657684 in this one sweet world its a typical situation to two step too much to fill the space between rhyme and reason if i had it all i would have the best of whats around with ants marching tripping billies cornbread and a crush everyday we drive in drive out trying to find grey street but its the time of the season to be stolen away on 55th and 3rd lover lay down where are you going
6657685 from s r nto s r nsubject s r n r n
6657686 i want to dedicate my victory today to all the victims and all the families of the victims in the flight in madrid yesterday and send them all of my support and everything of me that i can help for them
6657687 it is my hometown and when this thing happened i felt so bad yesterday and today
6657688 she doesnt give you any points especially on hardcourts she just played better than me today
6657689 its always cool just because its a place i came up to
6657690 i actually made it up through the organization that i was drafted by but its not like i have extra incentive not at all its been so long ago
6657691 i never looked at it as it was kind of a dump as a lot of people say it is
6657692 yeah the first time i ever played there was in the new york penn league we got to play a game there and it was cool
6657693 my first start was with the mets at second base and that will always be special i got my first major league home run and got four hits
6657694 it hurts too much to look at the future hopefully for some of the younger ones theres a chance theyll have another shot with reinstatement but in the present moment it just hurts
6657695 there is some parity in this sport ive been around long enough to expect everyone we play to be getting better sometimes a game looks easy and it really isnt
6657696 when i was little i watched the olympic games on television and was so impressed
6657697 jeg tror at de er imponerede over det der sker her i danmark
6657698 for mig er der ingen tvivl om at der er en stor bev genhed om den udvikling der sker i danmark for jeblikket og hvor k benhavn i h j grad er centrum de danske shipping milj er meget synligt og meget internationalt
6657699 vi sp rger dem simpelthen om ikke de skal v re med i den succes vi har her
6657700 its been huge for us to have oswalt turn it around the way that he has
6657701 going into wednesdays game we had the third best record in baseball since the all star break if you look at that stretch it by and large coincides with roys streak
6657702 you can run off five or six or seven in a row and youll be right up there with the leaders in the league as far as the win column but as far as wins its always more a plus than individual stuff but i feel like if i im winning im helping the team
6657703 i wasnt worried about him turning around for the simple fact that he is such a competitor and he wants to win so badly
6657704 even when he lost he still threw the ball well he just gave up that blooper when theres a man on base to score or somehow a guy ran into a pitch for a homer it wasnt like he truly ever struggled
6657705 i felt decent to pretty good at the beginning of the year but as far as results the results are a little better now
6657706 it doesnt really matter how you feel but if you go out there and throw quality starts together usually youre going to win
6657707 young guys have a chance to learn from them and the veterans in the rotation want to step up and do their part too when you have at least one guy in your rotation like that thats a boost to your team
6657708 anytime he comes out i know we all feel like its a game we can win
6657709 i dont think theres any question that roy was going to be the roy hes always going to be because roy is so competitive
6657710 to me thats more impressive than the fact that he has a nasty curveball and the extra stuff on the heater and all the stuff
6657711 if you lose your game you feel like you let the team down more than if you have some guys with you that can carry the load with you
6657712 i thought the new orleans environment for a preseason game was excellent
6657713 normally you dont get that much noise when you go on the road in the preseason
6657714 therell be twice that much noise friday night but that helps us get ready because thats the way itll be opening week at pittsburgh
6657715 to get timing offensively especially in the passing game you need some game time
6657716 thats one of those deals where if its not going good i dont think its the end of the world
6657717 theres a lot of preseason left to play but if its going good you better not relax
6657718 theyre as talented a team youll play in this league and i know theyre going to play extremely well this will be their first game at home and will be a great test for us were looking forward to it
6657719 there are a lot of things we could do better
6657720 were looking to run the ball better were going against a scheme 3 4 we havent practiced against so thats a change up for us
6657721 i think were just trying to continue to improve as a team and were trying to find the people that can help us do that
6657722 you cant really gauge how the season may go just by the way the preseason goes
6657723 obviously youre excited about hitting another guy and going against another team but when youre not really getting into a flow its not a real game feel
6657724 ball high is on the right track we have work to do no doubt but overall the staff is doing a good job
6657725 his cousin said vincent was playing in the ditch and he was going to go back to call his friends to where he was playing
6657726 it doesnt appear she was speeding and she didnt have a stop sign
6657727 there were no injuries and the cause is still under investigation
6657728 the owner complained of having electrical problems in the past
6657729 were looking into that it appears maybe it started in the kitchen area thats where the breaker box was
6657730 despite its reputation for sunny hot and muggy weather august actually is the second wettest month of the year in galveston county it turns out that the heavy rains weve seen over the past couple of weeks are not that rare for this time of year
6657731 thank you jesus i didnt i wanted to see it operate first
6657732 my main concern was to clear my name not about what punishment bertolino would get
6657733 i told the chief i would smile and take it for all the stuff i probably got away with over the years
6657734 when was the last time that the twins had four starters with at least ten wins
6657735 allowing americans in on tourist visas like this to just tour around im afraid of what might happen to me send them away immediately
6657736 you came from abidjan we have an office in abidjan you should have gotten your visa there
6657737 i have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others lives
6657738 the whole games havent gone quite as planned for team usa in track and field
6657739 i told my team that were running through the line no matter what
6657740 it gives you that extra edge it seems like we do that every year so lets do it again
6657741 one of the two samples of dna said to prove the existence of the bigfoot came from a human and the other was 96 percent from an opossum according to curt nelson a scientist at the university of minnesota who performed the dna analysis

6657743 ferret out where the weaknesses are and whether those things are important to your installation
6657744 to hard core nationalists and neoconservatives the acceptance of limits suggests retrenchment or irreversible decline in fact the reverse is true acknowledging the limits of american power is a precondition for stanching the losses of recent decades and for preserving the hard won gains of earlier generations going back to the founding of the republic to persist in pretending that the united states is omnipotent is to exacerbate the problems that we face the longer americans ignore the implications of dependency and the longer policy makers nurture the pretense that this country can organize the world to its liking the more precipitous will be its slide when the bills finally come due
6657745 the united states had already embarked upon a decade of unprecedented interventionism
6657746 the impulses that have landed us in a war of no exits and no deadlines come from within foreign policy has for decades provided an outward manifestation of american domestic ambitions urges and fears in our own time it has increasingly become an expression of domestic dysfunction an attempt to manage or defer coming to terms with contradictions besetting the american way of life these contradictions have found their ultimate expression in the perpetual state of war afflicting the united states today
6657747 the modern prophet of profligacy the politician who gave moral sanction to the empire of consumption
6657748 yet that way of life based for at least two generations on an ethic of self gratification and excess drastically reduced the resources available for such an all encompassing imperial enterprise
6657749 in contemporary american politics appearances belie reality although the text of the constitution has changed but little since fdrs day the actual system of governance conceived by the framers a federal republic deriving its authority from the people in which the central government exercises limited and specified powers no longer pertains
6657750 as the chief executive achieved supremacy the legislative branch not only lost clout but gradually made itself the object of ridicule
6657751 the failure to anticipate and avert 9 11 the failure to bring to justice its chief architects the failure to devise a realistic and strategically coherent response to the threat posed by islamic extremism and above all the egregious failures associated with the iraq and afghan wars
6657752 an odd alliance that combined left leaning do gooders with jingoistic politicians and pundits succeeded in chipping away at constraints on the use of force
6657753 the events of 9 11 reaffirmed a widespread popular preference for hiring someone elses kid to chase terrorists spread democracy and ensure access to the worlds energy reserves
6657754 to launch a war today to eliminate a danger that might post a threat at some future date
6657755 no doubt american economic power and military power are substantial yet when considering the events of the past several years above all the iraq war the presidents for us or against us ultimatum appears foolhardy in the extreme and his promise to eliminate evil manifestly absurd his policies have done untold damage
6657756 rather than insisting that the world accommodate the united states americans need to reassert control over their own destiny ending their condition of dependency and abandoning their imperial delusions of perhaps even greater difficulty the combination of economic political and military crisis summons americans to reexamine exactly what freedom entails soldiers cannot accomplish these tasks nor should we expect politicians to do so the onus of responsibility falls squarely on citizens

6657769 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6657770 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6657771 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6657772 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6657773 leading alliance members came to us and whispered in our ears hoping that we do not halt cooperation with nato on afghanistan
6657774 it is intended to give a more local look to the sinister plans

6657782 i think women should wear dresses like tennis players i think our outfits are so boring not sexy
6657783 the events of the past week in georgia have little in common with either hitlers dismemberment of czechoslovakia on the eve of world war ii or soviet policies in eastern europe they are better understood against the backdrop of the complicated ethnic politics of the caucasus a part of the world where historical grudges run deep and oppressed can become oppressors in the bat of an eye when it comes to apportioning blame for the latest flare up in the caucasus theres plenty to go around the russians were clearly itching for a fight but the behavior of georgian president mikheil saakashvili has been erratic and provocative the united states may have stoked the conflict by encouraging saakashvili to believe that he enjoyed american protection when the wests ability to impose its will in this part of the world is actually quite limited
6657784 the use of solar cells in this way shows the versatility of dye sensitised thin film technology i was extremely impressed with how well g24 innovations cells worked during my trip to antarctica earlier this year so this was a great opportunity to test them again i believe that this is just a hint of the potential of this technology

6657803 a definitive review and close reading of medical peer review journals and government health statistics shows that american medicine frequently causes more harm than good the number of people having in hospital adverse drug reactions adr to prescribed medicine is 2 2 million dr richard besser of the cdc in 1995 said the number of unnecessary antibiotics prescribed annually for viral infections was 20 million dr besser in 2003 now refers to tens of millions of unnecessary antibiotics the number of unnecessary medical and surgical procedures performed annually is 7 5 million the number of people exposed to unnecessary hospitalization annually is 8 9 million the total number of iatrogenic deaths shown in the following table is 783 936 it is evident that the american medical system is the leading cause of death and injury in the united states the 2001 heart disease annual death rate is 699 697 the annual cancer death rate 553 251
6657804 when the number one killer in a society is the healthcare system then that system has no excuse except to address its own urgent shortcomings its a failed system in need of immediate attention what we have outlined in this paper are insupportable aspects of our contemporary medical system that need to be changed beginning at its very foundations
6657805 when you realize how many drugs we use maybe those numbers arent so bad after all

6657815 john mccain doesnt have an education plan everybody knows the economy has changed and no matter what our economic policies were going to have to compete our children are going to have to compete against kids in china and kids in india and weve been slipping behind in education
6657816 we have to have high standards in our schools we have to strive for excellence for our children theres no doubt about that we are falling behind we rank 16th or 19th now in math and science we cant rank that low as wealthy of a nation as we are weve got to be number one
6657817 bsp winning seats in municipal elections last year has not affected our strength they have not won any seats reserved for dalits they won some seats in the mcd because we were a little weak then
6657818 i see no threat from bsp and we are not disturbed by their rise they will not be able to pose any threat to our traditional vote bank
6657819 this is not going to help bsp i am confident that we will emerge victorious for the third consecutive term in the polls
6657820 it does not mean that bsp is powerful the fact was that congress was weak at that time now our party has strengthened itself

6657827 when every single member country of the nsg has signed the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ctbt why should india get a free pass
6657828 pakistan has warned that carving out a huge exemption for india increases the risk of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent why should we allow india to vastly increase its nuclear weapons programme
6657829 as the end of his term nears president bush seeks to grant india a proliferation pardon excusing its past violations of arms control norms
6657830 the us today delivered to the nsg a draft rule change for india that undermines the entire international framework to limit spread of nuclear weapons bushs proposal contains no non proliferation controls whatsoever
6657831 since nsg can only change its rules by consensus every member has veto power over this disastrous attempt if these countries do not demand real non proliferation conditions on the proposed nuclear agreement with india the nsg may as well be voting itself out of existence
6657832 bsp winning seats in municipal elections last year has not affected our strength they have not won any seats reserved for dalits they won some seats in the mcd because we were a little weak then

6657842 he did not know he was dead until we told him
6657843 at one place the people there indicated hed been hanging around in salem
6657844 maybe regal got some communication about it so their interest is piqued
6657845 its been a different position and there are no boundaries to it
6657846 i dont think ive actually got it to the point where i know exactly what im doing yet what joe needs me to do to gain an advantage every day thats what i do
6657847 joe presented what the job was about at the winter meetings and i thought it was interesting and would be a good step for me
6657848 with all the information thats thrown out there today i thought the one position id always like to have was an information coach a guy who acts as a liaison between scouting and us in the dugout
6657849 i also thought we could use a guy to really organize our day a guy who scouts us and analyzes us kind of an assistant to everybody
6657850 the toughest thing is not having the interaction with players during the game and experiencing the emotions in the dugout
6657851 when we had the fight with the red sox sitting up in the press box i obviously knew what happened and why it happened but i didnt know what was said
6657852 a guy like joe and his personality makes this job work
6657853 i dont think this job works for every manager in the major leagues
6657854 one of the things is he doesnt want anything to catch him by surprise no idea is a bad idea its just a matter of if hes going to use it or not
6657855 hes always been that type of guy since we were kids
6657856 one thing about bogie is hes the most down to earth guy you would never know he was a big league player
6657857 now this is a compliment but he did more with less than any player i had
6657858 he caught on quick and he wasnt afraid to work
6657859 his attitude is such that hell be a major league manager someday he knows how to handle people
6657860 my ultimate goal someday is to manage in the majors but there are only 30 of those jobs
6657861 basically youve got to wait your turn and try to gather as much experience as possible
6657862 there is a significant and increasing body of evidence for a link between brain tumors

6657867 we are currently experiencing a reactively unchecked and dangerous situation
6657868 in the years 2008 2012 we will have reached the appropriate length of follow up time to begin to definitively observe the impact of this global technology on brain tumor incidence rates
6657869 malignant brain tumor incidence and its associated death rate will be observed globally to rise within a decade from now
6657870 although apple doesnt have an exclusive carrier agreement in india buyers who pick up a model from airtel wont be able to switch over to vodafone or vice versa
6657871 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6657872 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6657873 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6657874 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed
6657875 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6657876 i thought the scores werent going to be as low
6657877 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6657878 just because a product says its natural doesnt mean its nontoxic
6657879 oh yeah youre with that other guy who was just here
6657880 several cross sectional studies have found significant associations of lower folate and hyperhomocysteinemia with dementia or cognitive impairment but the direction of cause and effect is not known
6657881 the onset of dementia was significantly associated with an exaggerated decline in folate a weaker increase in vitamin b12 concentrations and an exaggerated increase in homocysteine concentrations over the follow up period
6657882 further research is required to clarify these complex longitudinal interrelationships
6657883 in the meantime attention needs to be paid to the nutritional status of people with dementia from the time of diagnosis onwards regardless of whether this is a cause or effect of their condition
6657884 the evidence that breastfeeding improves cognitive development is based almost entirely on observational studies and is thus prone to confounding by subtle behavioral differences in the breastfeeding mothers behavior or her interaction with the infant
6657885 these results based on the largest randomized trial ever conducted in the area of human lactation provide strong evidence that prolonged and exclusive breastfeeding improves childrens cognitive development
6657886 because protection against infections in developed country settings does not have the life and death implications for infant and child health that it does in less developed settings cognitive benefits may be among the most important advantages for breastfed infants in industrialized societies
6657887 the consistency of our findings based on a randomized trial with those reported in previous observational studies should prove helpful in encouraging further public health efforts to promote protect and support breastfeeding
6657888 supplementation with vitamin e may antagonize vitamin k in healthy adults but it is unclear whether intake of vitamin e decreases the risk of venous thromboembolism vte
6657889 the womens health study tested whether vitamin e supplementation for 10 years decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease or cancer in a large group of women without these diseases at entry we report here the effect of randomized allocation to vitamin e or placebo on the occurrence of vte a prospectively evaluated secondary end point of this trial
6657890 these data suggest that supplementation with vitamin e may reduce the risk of vte in women and those with a prior history or genetic predisposition may particularly benefit
6657891 the estimated numbers of women who need to be treated with vitamin e for 10 years to prevent 1 vte were 357 95 ci 200 to 1659 in the overall population and 52 95 ci 32 to 144 in the high risk subgroup of women with a history of vte or prothrombotic mutation
6657892 overall vitamin e may be a useful treatment for prevention of a first or recurrent vte
6657893 because vte was a prospectively evaluated secondary end point of the womens health study the protective effect observed here requires confirmation in additional studies given its lack of efficacy for prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer vitamin e may be most appropriate for people at high risk of vte
6657894 women can now give consumer reviews of doctors midwives hospitals and birth centers learn about the choices and birth experiences of others and view data on hospital and birth center standard practices and intervention rates
6657895 our goal is to give women a mechanism that can be used to share information about maternity care practices in their community while at the same time providing practitioners and institutions feedback for quality of care improvement efforts
6657896 for years consumers have enthusiastically shared online reviews of movies restaurants products and services but readily available information about maternity care providers and birth settings was nearly unattainable but no longer
6657897 hats off to the coalition for improving maternity services the incredible women working within community based birth networks throughout the us and to all the women who are sharing their birth stories
6657898 share your story voice your opinion mamas its important and it feels really good kind of like having a baby if you dont how will your experience help others
6657899 having a rock god like jimmy page and a singer like leona lewis performing together for the first time will certainly be something to remember

6657903 hungry spies have infiltrated usst headquarters and have managed to capture these few rare pictures from the otherwise secretive team
6657904 coaching in the final yesterday it was so good for my heart that so many people are engaged in womens soccer
6657905 if you looked at the quality of the game and the excitement it had everything extra time that game was not only good for the usa but it was good for womens soccer overall
6657906 womens football is improving all the time and its getting tighter and tighter so now you have a handful of teams that can win the olympics and the world cup and thats really good for womens soccer overall
6657907 things are going to happen we are going to get beat every once in a while by these guys there are just way too good but we knew that we couldnt get down on ourselves and i think that confidence throughout all our games got us to where we are now
6657908 later on in the game especially when it went into overtime we could tell by their body language that they were really tired so that we knew that we had to take advantage of that
6657909 it says a lot about the team that we were able to come back after the opening norway loss here and after a huge devastating loss at the world cup last year and losing some players as well
6657910 pia not only strives for the players on the field but makes the chemistry off it and i think that definitely contributed to this gold medal
6657911 its just so much fun playing for her weve found a new passion and really love for one another
6657912 its the best job ive ever had its just the best thing that ive ever done and as a coach this is unbelievable sort of a pipe dream
6657913 i suppose if youve got seven maybe eight houses the economy looks fundamentally sound to you but if youre having trouble making the mortgage payment then the economy looks awful different
6657914 i make this point not to simply give john mccain a hard time its indicative of a different world view about whats happening in america
6657915 you dont need to have a nobel prize in economics to understand that the economy has not been making progress for most people
6657916 does a guy who made more than us 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6657917 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6657918 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6657919 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6657920 one of his biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion purchasing part of the property he couldnt afford now hes a convicted felon facing jail
6657921 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
6657922 coalition leaders are expected to meet friday the talks will focus on the the judges issue
6657923 they rehman and wali are mediating and we hope they will come up with a solution
6657924 it is striking how unqualified sen barack obama is and and how this whole thing came about with within the democrat sic party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6657925 i think this is a classic illustration here where affirmative action has reared its ugly head against them its the reverse of it theyve theyve ended up nominating and placing at the top of their ticket somebody whos not qualified who has not earned it
6657926 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6657927 when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember its seven
6657928 and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6657929 did not get a sweetheart deal from a fraud embezzler like tony rezko to buy their houses
6657930 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6657931 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6657932 instead of invoking paris britney and obscure sixties radicals sen
6657933 the government has no policy to revoke thaksins red passport
6657934 even the discounters will have to work hard to lure customers in to shop
6657935 these retailers should expect to see more and more competition from nontraditional rivals like office supply stores
6657936 her addiction to illicit drugs is the explanation for her involvement
6657937 one of her young children was a potential prosecution witness in this case

6657940 there wont be any time to just put my toes in but im looking forward to it
6657941 i enjoyed being a coach and an athletic director and there was always something that intrigued me about a program the size of st viator
6657942 after talking to some people i thought it would probably be worth looking into
6657943 st viator teams have a great tradition already in athletics so im not coming in to overhaul the program
6657944 education is first and athletics is a secondary part of the academic experience i want the experience to be the best possible experience for the student athletes it can be
6657945 i think november 10th i might have a bout with nostalgia
6657946 but ive come to the realization im ok with it
6657947 ive coached the last 10 years at the high school level but at the same token ive enjoyed the position of athletic director and its something ive embraced as well
6657948 it was going to take something unique and something special to pull me away
6657949 our politics have become so embedded and so partisan with so many special interests that they require a massive effort from the public telling them we want something done
6657950 the prospects of being born in the united states are still better than being born anyplace else in the world
6657951 it has not paid to sell america short since 1776 and the time to start is not in 2008
6657952 what we have to do is to recognize and reward elected officials democrats republicans independents whatever who tell the truth and who stand up and try to help make tough choices sooner rather than later to make sure that americas future is better than its past and reject the b s and the nothing types of solutions and platitudes that we hear from so many politicians today
6657953 it is truly tragic that pakistan has fallen repeatedly into the hands of leaders unable to put their own interests on the backburner and place those of the country at the forefront
6657954 due to the unprecedented demand for american eagle gold one ounce bullion coins our inventories have been depleted we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins

6658022 el secretario de transportes ricardo jaime nos trajo un presente griego con este proyecto
6658023 era conocida por el gobierno y por el secretario de transporte
6658024 lamentablemente ese acta si no se deroga si no se recomienda al poder ejecutivo que cambie el acuerdo realizado va a haber un derecho para marsans m s all de lo que diga la ley

6658028 necesidad de continuidad en el funcionamiento de estas empresas implica que no queden ciudades sin este servicio esencial
6658029 no creemos que haya que convalidar una deuda fraudulenta de marsans amparada por un comportamiento delictivo y de connivencia de jaime

6658064 since the 2005 ranking the walton college has consistently stayed in the top 25 public business schools as well as in the top 45 public and private schools
6658065 the u s news ranking is a verification that the college is deserving of high national recognition as a leading business school
6658066 we attribute this ranking to our top quality educational and research programs that our faculty and staff provide our students
6658067 we also appreciate the partnerships weve created with other university units on campus our alumni donors and friends advisory boards and community and business people who have all helped us achieve this recognition through their significant investments of time and resources
6658068 the sustained high rankings help us attract academically talented students as well as increase the value of their degrees a favorable ranking opens doors for our students because employers frequently use rankings to decide where they will recruit new employees it also helps us recruit and retain top faculty an area where there is tremendous competition among leading business schools
6658069 these are separate disputes but there is a pattern emerging of unfair sackings a rise in complaints about bullying and harassment and the failure of lul management to stand by staff who are victims of assault

6658071 on the charing cross group our members have already taken action for the re instatement of jerome bowes who was sacked for defending himself against an attack from behind by someone who had already been involved in a fight on new years eve
6658072 jeromes colleagues are incensed at the treatment he has received and the union has today agreed to a request to ballot drivers at elephant and castle depot for action as well
6658073 the bottom line in both these disputes is that our members have the right to work in an atmosphere of trust and co operation and without the fear of being fired without good reason and we want to see our members re instated

6658088 axe is now at a stage where it is ready to begin business as a market operator greg has done an excellent job in getting this business to a position where a licence is imminent and customers are connected and ready to go
6658089 susan bray has been our head of regulatory and market policy for the past two years and has been responsible for developing axes regulatory and supervision model the integrity of which is essential to our application to the federal government for a market licence
6658090 her background and experience in senior regulatory and supervisory roles at asx including as head of regulatory policy at asx equips her very well to steer the organisation particularly through this final stage prior to a decision on our licence
6658091 i have worked with axe for the past two years and am delighted to be in this role when we see a new era of competition in the australian capital markets the entry of axe will bring greater liquidity reduce costs and enhance the status of australia as a financial services hub
6658092 axe will continue to work with government and regulators to further develop our market supervision capabilities so the government can confidently allow axe to operate under a framework which promotes the highest levels of market integrity

6658107 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6658108 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6658109 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6658110 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6658116 and 50 cash is a nice gift i also added my name to the online casinos studys contact list for future surveys interviews and any public discussions its a very interesting and important topic
6658117 i was impressed with the publics awareness of online casinos trends in their daily lives ive been studying them for months now and some surveyees raised questions that i couldnt readily answer in those cases i referred them to write their comments down and submit them to our directors for further review
6658118 i chose not to answer that question because it had nothing to do with the study of online casinos and everything to do with my personal finances as a result i did not qualify for a compensatory gift but that is fine privacy is important even if were collecting data for academic purposes
6658119 im very excited about tallying the data from this important online casinos survey
6658120 this is the first time weve asked for public participation in our scientific research and were absolutely flattered and grateful by the turn out i expect preliminary results will be tabulated by next month at which point well release general findings about important online casinos trends in this society to the local media
6658121 for those surveyees that took part in all three of the online casinos survey sections we offered three different forms of compensation a cash gift of 50 gift certificate to a local restaurant or a gift card for the upcoming holiday season at the local mall
6658122 usually i just sign off on results and make sure they are published in a timely matter but this time i really wanted to get hands on with this online casinos subject matter so i decided to aide my fellow employees with statistical measurements and data analysis personally im very curious about local online casinos ideas and trends
6658123 weve seen some very interesting commonalities across cultures ethnicities and various different societies online casinos survey takers were very considerate in their answers and this helped us greatly to further tune our hypotheses in the end well have a great set of data to analyze and study for the future as we continue to review how online casinos factors work in society

6658164 the coaches gave me their talks about how it wasnt such a good idea to go then and there
6658165 pretty much telling me i need to be on second base i remember on the first pitch i didnt go and he kind of gave me that fatherly what are you doing look
6658166 he told me to get a good walking lead and stay on my toes you never know whats going to happen
6658167 question him putting me in the game thats why hes a players manager hes going to give you that leash to hang yourself with and hes also going to give you that chance to redeem yourself

6658183 we are sending a team to the talk as we dont want to be accused of shying away from resolving the issue
6658184 it is needless to talk about the land now there are larger issues at stake
6658185 there is no guarantee of peace when mobs are huge our response will be calibrated
6658186 adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are not mature enough to have a beer
6658187 i do not regard our national debt as unduly alarming
6658188 weve overcome things far worse than what is going on right now
6658189 what concerns me more than anything is our savings rate
6658190 the problem is getting the public understanding and the political will to do something about it
6658191 the important thing to remember is that the pie gets larger over time and theres more to divide up
6658192 creo que la interpelaci n es una oportunidad para que todo el pa s y todos los congresistas puedan escuchar un diagn stico claro de qu se ha hecho qu no se ha hecho y d nde est n los problemas y eval en lo realizado por el ministerio

6658198 and it would be a dream come true me kicking in the nfl then being able to come back to kenan stadium and watch my brother kick for the tar heels
6658199 were both working hard to try to make that happen
6658200 whether its an onside kick a kickoff a short field goal an extra point whoever gives us the best chance to make that work thats whos going to be in the game
6658201 because each one of them has something now that they do well
6658202 the one thing that no one can answer is how they will react when there are 65 000 people in the stands and mom and dad are there and if they miss the kick we lose the game
6658203 hes a little bit smaller than i was as a freshman but hes got the tools and the mentality to get it done
6658204 im on cloud nine this is the best feeling ive ever had its unbelievable
6658205 everybody knows it everybody fears it its just a matter of time before he does it in the third set he got on a roll thats what great blockers do
6658206 its the best feeling ive ever had in my life
6658207 i was on a roll i saw the ball and put my hand on it and thats it
6658208 can do everything the sport demands a lot of 6 9 guys can hit the snot out of the ball but they cant set like he does or have the great hands and skills he does
6658209 the whole games havent gone quite as planned for team usa in track and field
6658210 i told my team that were running through the line no matter what
6658211 i blocked it all out its just one of those things where you see everything perfectly and it all seems to be in slow motion
6658212 when he gets on a roll i just pull out my pompons and give a little cheer and keep smiling and clapping
6658213 thats what good blockers do when they get on a roll good luck to you
6658214 it gives you that extra edge it seems like we do that every year so lets do it again
6658215 the magnitude of the improvement has been a little bit of a surprise
6658216 theyve broken through in some sports that we thought it would be very hard for them to win medals in
6658217 we better learn how to develop real teams in ping pong and badminton and some other sports where they dominate
6658218 they didnt know what the sport was 10 years ago
6658219 theyre taking it out of the hides of the rest of the world
6658220 in 10 years we have achieved what european and north american countries worked on for 40 to 50 years
6658221 its not as relaxed or as easy as you think
6658222 actually we worked very hard and trained very hard every day we train from morning to night
6658223 it got me so worked up so i guess this method worked
6658224 the thing i think you can see in the faces of chinese athletes is theyre having fun out there
6658225 if they break through in those medal opportunities in track and field and swimming where weve traditionally been dominant and relied on them for 50 to 60 of the medals for the united states team then well have a much more difficult time obviously to maintain the total medal count
6658226 you shouldnt regard this as some sort of formal investigation
6658227 yes we have asked the international gymnastics federation to look into what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies on this case
6658228 we did discuss it earlier in these games and we believed that this had addressed the issue however with some questions remaining we have now asked the federation to take a further look
6658229 more information has come to light that did point to discrepancies
6658230 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegations of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely
6658231 i believe these primary documents issued by the chinese state rise to a level of evidence higher than allegation
6658232 i have no policy to revoke his passport or doing anything on that
6658233 it got me pretty square then i had to go toward first base but i had to get the out as bad as it hurt i just went after it and was able to make the play
6658234 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
6658235 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
6658236 the sinker had great action the changeup was really good tonight
6658237 it just has such action down below the hitting area out of the hand it looks like a good pitch to hit and you have to commit
6658238 it put a little length between us and l a
6658239 nows the time of year we start looking when we start following other teams and looking at the scoreboard we need to take care of business
6658240 pretty much from here on out its just so close were trying to win every game for the team if i clean up on decisions great but im just trying to go out and get deep into the game give us a chance to win
6658241 he gets more people to chase pitches down in the zone so you just have to be really patient and really selective at what you swing at

6658247 i dont know i have no idea everybody looks good to me
6658248 i thought i played well and i thought we played well as a unit
6658249 i thought as a unit we had been playing all right we just hadnt been scoring points finally we kind of got over that and put up 20 points in the first half which was good
6658250 hes our quarterback and i think he can play good football for us but it was good to see him validate that tonight

6658259 to help us get more traction as we move into episodic the character has a background in computer hacking weve used the character to sort of open up this channel to the parents who were activists back in the day and who were very keen on saving the world but as a result sort of neglected their own children
6658260 without going into too much detail its that jaime was originally working in a lab she was going to be assigned to these chimpanzees the chimpanzees were going to dr anthros chris bowers who was using them for experimentation he would come down to get the chimpanzees and they sort of fell in love during that time we were looking for an organic way for her to be talking to the chimpanzees in sign language
6658261 of course the chimpanzees disappeared the lab disappeared the sign language the sister stayed but now her deafness disappeared as well
6658262 i remember sitting in the scene once with josh that opening scene where i let him have it
6658263 i remember being a producer talking to writers and trying my damnedest to get them to be at their best its the hardest thing to do and i would be as rough on them as this guy was but when i looked him in the eye and i said you can do better i remembered what it felt like on my end of it to not know how or just be at a loss im talking to somebody whos capable of better and isnt doing it thats a very difficult thing to get somebody to dip down into their insides because a lot of people who are capable of going there get used to skimming the surface and they feel its going fine
6658264 i have no idea if this was in any way based on moehringers real editor my guess is it wasnt that somebody invented this character for the purpose of telling the story the way they tell it i mean i met the guy i met moehringer after we made the movie when we were at sundance and he seemed very happy with the whole thing
6658265 i wonder if everybody isnt quoted out of context i just got used to that because im not running for office or anything people will have a tape recorder and so hear exactly what you say but then when they get home they jam together a few quotes into the same sentence that create an impression that you wouldnt have created if you were asked to say them but that doesnt put me at odds with them its just people do get misquoted

6658347 they have indicated that in the next few months they will decide whether australia will bid for the 2018 commonwealth games or future commonwealth games so i was keen to put our hand up early
6658348 in the next month or so there will be a meeting of the board of management to make a decision on whether we want to put a bid forward for 2018 then we will start the process among the state governments
6658349 i pick a location and i photograph that location and then i try to figure out what the actual presence means in terms of spirits or ghosts
6658350 usually the places that i pick are places of either great spiritual presence or really intense almost horror like some act of genocide happened there i need to come to terms with that to understand it better and the only way i can do that is by approaching it and then incorporating it into my work

6658563 the prosecutor has spent nearly every day of his career to get me in this jail on a misdemeanor for something i really didnt do
6658564 im going to have three meals a day and just relax
6658565 he hugo campa just gets his mail here i keep his records because i know him
6658566 take the cup off and pound the crap out of it
6658567 at least i dont have to sleep there keep your mouth closed
6658568 we havent had our convention yet i dont appreciate everyone telling us the outcome
6658569 im going into debt to go to denver if theyre telling us that we have a nominee i feel insulted
6658570 im having to hope that she gets the most votes
6658571 were still convinced that hillary clinton is the one who would make the ticket the strongest
6658572 we have to be realistic but we cant give up
6658573 is they party leaders are not going to let the democratic process work
6658574 maybe we have a shotgun marriage where obama and clinton still get together
6658575 were not going to let them clinton delegates push him into taking who they say it is
6658576 ill be glad when the convention is over because then well have one nominee
6658577 you know what this guy isnt right for me hes actually kind of an elitist jerk hes only nice to the certain type who impress him i dont like that at all
6658578 we really need to try to pursue any potential new revenue streams possible
6658579 its not about trying to fill all the space we have it really isnt
6658580 to me its drawing the line almost as we go
6658581 i do find it offensive that this is another captive audience ploy
6658582 if the school district was flush with money there wouldnt be a need to look into additional revenue streams unfortunately thats not the case
6658583 the benefits of increased revenue to the district outweigh the negatives
6658584 its about the same number of people who were asking they were just asking for more help
6658585 its the higher costs of things out in the world
6658586 its choices in life maybe you skimp someplace else but our families know education is an investment
6658587 when the economy is sort of mushy like this i think people tend to move around
6658588 its the extra things its the uniforms and the lunch program
6658589 its more people just saying gosh i just need help with the little things
6658590 for whats been happening in the economy we seem to be doing as well or better as weve done in recent years
6658591 this is not going to be one of the things that families are going to eliminate from a family budget early on
6658592 we may be impacted by the economic status as early as next year
6658593 we really dont have much of a reaction because we do not have many alcohol related incidents on campus
6658594 we were contacted to sign and decided we wouldnt sign even though we were sympathetic to some of the motivations that prompted it
6658595 were going to have a meeting of the vice presidents council next thursday and were going to talk about it
6658596 were going to pull in some of the people on campus who really are familiar with the issues
6658597 that is the extent of the statement we wish to say about it
6658598 i am not encouraging teenagers to drink that is not why i signed it
6658599 we have a drinking problem in the nation on college campuses the current law does not resolve it
6658600 you can sign up to die for our country but you cant drink
6658601 it doesnt make sense if you can make that choice you should be able to do both
6658602 the tendency to go overboard is because you dont know your limits
6658603 if its not forbidden you dont feel the need to go overboard
6658604 the issue is not going to go away or change with the age
6658605 and if college presidents believe it will they are just putting their heads in the sand
6658606 we are saddled with a very difficult enforcement problem and disabled to some extent to carrying on the education function the best way possible
6658607 once you go to college the expectation is that youre going to drink
6658608 rather than hide it these college presidents acknowledge the situation its definitely something we should think about
6658609 better black television has been a vision of mine for some years
6658610 real newspapers are losing readers by the minute especially those labeled college aged
6658611 yet amid the industry death march its farm system thrives according to a 2006 report in the wall street journal readership and revenue of college papers has generally held steady or grown in recent years
6658612 theres still no better place for the misfit freshman yearning to be relevant and make a difference take a closer look at those freshmen and you see the character of journalism at its formative stage

6658616 do not adequately slow the rate of neurodegeneration in alzheimers patients as such there is an urgent need to develop new treatments for alzheimers dementia
6658617 tau is natively unfolded or floppy so in solution it moves around a lot and can adopt many different structures
6658618 you can measure the lengths of individual molecules and the average will be a pretty good description of any one
6658619 are all over the place theyre so diverse that its difficult to get one measurement that describes all of the possible structures
6658620 we generated lots and lots of structures for both normal tau and a mutant form
6658621 a list of all types of suspect conformations for known tau mutants then from that list we can design drugs for each
6658622 it is truly tragic that pakistan has fallen repeatedly into the hands of leaders unable to put their own interests on the backburner and place those of the country at the forefront
6658623 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6658624 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6658625 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6658626 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6658627 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6658628 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals
6658629 only safe animal dietary supplements are allowed on the market
6658630 were trying to get the nerve tissue to integrate with a device to grow into it to form a better connection
6658631 to get long term release we think these multi component systems are the way to go
6658632 we can control the release by combining the materials in different ways and were confident that we can extend the release time further even to 90 days

6658634 many people in mindanao are terrified of a return to a period when armed muslim insurgents and christian vigilante ilaga groups attacked civilians with impunity
6658635 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6658636 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now the fig has proved that
6658637 as it is we need to work with china because of the role that china has played so far i think the potential of the role one of friendship and the cooperation many of the problems confronting the region are not of our making whether you are talking of the resources whether you are talking about trade climate change and economy we certainly need the cooperation and support from china
6658638 china received the largest number of athletes from around the pacific region they have received wonderful care and have been given great opportunity to compete with others and learned a great deal we hope to make use of these experiences and are confident of the athletes in their competition

6658640 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
6658641 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
6658642 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6658643 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation
6658644 the timing of assads visit is very important it happens at the time when russia is very angry at the united states
6658645 it is highly possible that russia being so angered by the west and the united states now may sell something very nasty to syria
6658646 held in a secure format on site and downloaded onto a memory stick for processing which has since been lost
6658647 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6658648 we expect the home office to provide us at the information commissioners office with a copy of the internal investigation report and its findings
6658649 we will then decide what further action may be appropriate searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information
6658650 its entrusted with a great deal of highly confidential material and it seems to be entirely incapable of keeping it secure
6658651 and the consequences are very serious theyre serious because it may lead to the identity of the people involved being revealed
6658652 one of the possible consequences is that they criminals will bring legal actions against the government and the taxpayer will then have to pay damages to people who appear to be pretty undeserving because of the governments incompetence
6658653 the government is not giving attention to this at all
6658654 its so involved in this quagmire on the judges its not paying attention to the real challenges the country is facing and terrorism is the most important challenge facing this nation
6658655 is it our war or is it somebody elses war why are we being made to kill our own people
6658656 it is going to get worse and worse and the time will come where the entire nation of pakistan will say get out america

6658666 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more

6658668 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6658669 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6658670 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration

6658676 a total of 15 556 subjects answered the questions on snoring
6658677 these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
6658678 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
6658679 these new findings suggest that further knowledge about the early life environment may contribute to the primary prevention of snoring

6658682 it is the greatest challenge for any statesman today to see what is the right priority
6658683 is it iran russia the price of oil terrorism it may in some ways look like the cold war again but the context today is blurred past recognition
6658684 will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic means
6658685 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor georgia and whitewash a criminal regime
6658686 the russian federation and the united states are not about to enter a new cold war even if tensions between moscow and washington rise dramatically
6658687 the cold war pitted an ideologically driven soviet union against the free world a conflict where both sides devoted enormous resources to defeat the other
6658688 an ideologically driven notion that the only possible choices these two countries have for relations are total conflict or total agreement neither of which is possible or desirable
6658689 we are stuck in relationships in which major powers are not enemies but not friends
6658690 the un isnt working the new world order and the democracy surplus never came to be but there are networks of capital and cooperation between russia china and the west that werent there before

6658693 russias strength is made possible by oil at 150 a barrel
6658694 if oil is cut to 60 a barrel russia is sunk russians spend less on research and development than poland they want bank accounts in the west to make millionaires off sales to europe they dont want a big war they want to gain influence and manipulate
6658695 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
6658696 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6658697 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6658698 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6658699 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6658700 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job
6658701 but it got remodeled evolution is a cumulative process you have this machinery and its easy to add a bell or a whistle with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6658702 we have enough evidence to believe this evolved in a male specific way
6658703 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
6658704 as long as the gain outweighs the cost the feature will survive the fruit flys color pattern is a paradigm for understanding how to use the same sets of genes in different sexes to come up with different features
6658705 we have always said that the roles missions and size of the american forces here the coalition forces was based on the conditions on the ground and what is needed

6658710 if he sounded as i might wish him to sound he could not be elected
6658711 and he may not be elected even as his intellect and savvy puts him worlds ahead of his republican counterpart and that is all i wish to say on the matter
6658712 im not arguing that its wrong to vote for obama though i do say its wrong headed to vote for him with any lofty expectations
6658713 i feel this sometimes has something to do with something i care about and
6658714 obama does not represent the triumph of an advancing anti racist movement but rather the necessity at the highly refracted level of electoral politics of abandoning old agendas largely by not mentioning them
6658715 to give up that thrilled sense of possibility that thrilled sense that something really big might be changing in this area which is so long overdue

6658720 dave has been my coach for over 10 years now and i have brought my 5000m time down by two and half minutes under his guidance he has a science background but more importantly has a great feel for his runners dave always has me peaking well for championships and is constantly looking for different training methods to get the most out of my ability
6658721 my mom knew that i was really good at singin and she knew id learn more songs and she thought id sing better here so she brought me here to audition and i got in the choir
6658722 some of the songs are pretty hard on some points when you have to go high and then you drop down really low
6658723 i have a high and a low voice which is pretty good for singing some good songs
6658724 cooked simply in a tuscan sort of way nicely spicy with a thin coat of olive oil and amply roasted so the pull of gravity was enough to let the flavorful meat fall from the bones
6658725 while the vinegar and peppers crank up the velocity its the smoky goodness that slows the chewing and makes a diner bask in the inner glow of embers long since darkened
6658726 i joke around and say i lost all my baby weight on the wiggles diet
6658727 i dont think ive ever had a 9 to 5 job in my life
6658728 this was totally the opposite end of the spectrum where i thought i was going to end up nothing on the radar no blip anywhere
6658729 music wise its very similar to the pop songs that we were doing
6658730 we do try and gear it to keeping things as simple as possible you start a song with a chorus rather than a verse its all getting to the point for children
6658731 it was a way of involving me on stage without me having to actually do much i just have to fall asleep
6658732 its a really empowering thing for children to be able to wake an adult up its really a concept they understand im actually a very light sleeper but dont tell the children that
6658733 they say it has a very calming effect on children and adults
6658734 im very proud of grey ranks but still just amazed at being recognized by my peers and the industry as a whole
6658735 the game is pretty far out there in terms of role playing experiences
6658736 this is not a game played just for enjoyment but also for understanding its a work of art in every sense and challenges other games and game designers to rise to its level of excellence
6658737 theres a growing movement to use the role playing game which is by nature powerfully interactive to accomplish interesting things beyond raw entertainment im lucky to live in the triangle where there is a thriving group of independent game designers
6658738 i cant believe im here im really happy really excited i love swimming so its been a great trip
6658739 as her last grandma said theres only one katie and she plays by the tune of a different drummer
6658740 i guess you gotta get used to it thats just katie its very nerve wracking but she was in good hands with james
6658741 it was the lap of luxury people treated us to everything nothing like the beginning of the trip
6658742 i just graduated from college so ive just been thinking about you know what my futures holds
6658743 he is simply one of the best new musicians ive heard during the latest years
6658744 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6658745 so far everything that has been received demonstrates we have no problem for the eligibility of the competitors
6658746 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6658747 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6658748 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6658749 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6658750 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6658751 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition

6658758 it would have been much more effective had you spoke to the driver directly
6658759 either the dhl truck would have been moved or you could have gotten the drivers name truck number and complained to dhl
6658760 take responsibility for those things you want to have changed such as a truck being moved dont just complain about it do something about it
6658761 fedex gets my vote for having the most obnoxious and insensitive driver
6658762 he said he was only going to be in there a minute
6658763 i watched him drive down to another storefront and park across from that entrance as he should have done where we were
6658764 the person i spoke with said their drivers are trained in these matters but occasionally need reminding i gave him the license plate number of the offending truck driver and hope hes more considerate these days
6658765 he can not beat up girls rachel meadows and the little black messiah barack obama
6658766 lets still see other people just not tell each other
6658767 lets just see each other not see anyone else and see where this takes us
6658768 what if i told you i slept with someone two days ago
6658769 you shouldnt regard this as some sort of formal investigation
6658770 yes we have asked the international gymnastics federation to look into what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies on this case
6658771 we did discuss it earlier in these games and we believed that this had addressed the issue however with some questions remaining we have now asked the federation to take a further look
6658772 more information has come to light that did point to discrepancies
6658773 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegations of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely
6658774 i believe these primary documents issued by the chinese state rise to a level of evidence higher than allegation
6658775 since participants have committed themselves to attending the minbizcon and the pnp philippine national police and afp armed forces of the philippines have guaranteed security there is no reason not to push through with the event
6658776 we are one with the people of dipolog dapitan and zamboanga del norte in claiming that our place is among the most peaceful in mindanao
6658777 the 17th mindanao business conference is not only for the dipolog chamber it is for the entire mindanao business community
6658778 we continue to rapidly diversify our product range at ocz in order to offer an end to end line of high performance gaming solutions to our customers
6658779 the new dominatrix mouse is no exception offering world class performance and specifications guaranteed to provide the discerning gamer and enthusiast with an unparalleled tactile control experience
6658780 im dying to know who it is said the tight end davis who praised all three quarterbacks
6658781 the nice thing is i know im capable of so much more in this system smith said referring to offensive coordinator mike martz
6658782 the frustrating thing is that there are a couple of plays you wish you could have back
6658783 my responsibility is to get better every day and continue to grow i dont think that changes no matter what they decide
6658784 we can dominate anybody if we go out there with the right game plan which im pretty sure well have davis said
6658785 a concern would be the kicking game in particular coach mike nolan said
6658786 our coverage units have not been very good that last couple of weeks
6658787 special teams was an area that was very strong for us a year ago probably the best in the league nolan said
6658788 it hasnt been strong the last few weeks so we need to correct those things
6658789 this is a loss for the entire nfl gene was the epitome of what the nfl stands for he was not only a man who gave his very best on the field every game during his great career but he was a man of integrity and service off the field
6658790 it was very shocking news to the profession to us as players its very disappointing to hear because of all the things hes done over the years and the way hes represented us
6658791 we believe that the opportunities particularly in difficult situations are in the debt
6658792 i think it will be relatively fragile as confidence builds and it will take probably another year for confidence to be completely returned
6658793 new apartment construction will be a very small percentage maybe 40 percent of what it has been in the past few years
6658794 with no new supply i think that the prospects for the rental housing market are very strong
6658795 the conditions under which men live upon earth are the result of their state of consciousness to seek to change the conditions without changing the consciousness is a vain chimera
6658796 infelizmente n o demos import ncia suficiente a isso n o nos prepar mos para tal eventualidade

6658801 to destroy an animal of this size is never an easy task
6658802 what had to be done was done this animal is no longer suffering
6658803 the only way it could have been done without suffering
6658804 all our experience that orrca has with cetaceans in this situation is that they very easily get stressed and a very quick dont think about it response is not the way to go
6658805 you need to gather your information talk to as many people as you can and thats exactly what national parks did
6658806 it was a pre programmed effort by the relevant authorities to slaughter the whale
6658807 they went out with a harpoon euthanasia lance to kill that whale
6658808 i personally watched that whale swim from one end of the bay to the other in five minutes it continuously dived under two boats nuzzling for a feed
6658809 all i wanted to do was step on that boat and leech some fluid into the water
6658810 we have the engineering device to install on a yacht and a simulated whale blubber that we could manufacture and put together at the very low cost of 10 000 within 24 hours
6658811 we wanted approval from the relevant government authority to go ahead with and do that were not radical were a marine salvage unit
6658812 we had a reprieve yesterday thursday at 4pm of 24 hours half an hour later i was informed that im sorry were retracting that were putting that whale down now
6658813 if the national parks people could possibly have done something for it they would have
6658814 the cost of living is rising and the number of pensioners living in poverty is rising so older people who are feeling the pinch should make sure theyre doing all they can to get the benefits that are rightfully theirs
6658815 older people in the east of england should find out today if theyre entitled to benefits such as pension credit council tax benefit or housing benefit
6658816 even if people have made an unsuccessful claim in the past changing circumstances and changing benefit levels may mean they are now eligible for money that can make a huge difference to their daily lives
6658817 it is a disincentive to save and people get penalised

6658819 although it is still august and winter seems a long way off i want people to think of the colder months ahead

6658821 we consider ourselves immensely lucky to have received this money from the baroness but we will go on fund raising until we are absolutely certain the total will be reached
6658822 it is like running an old car it goes on and on but if you dont maintain the parts it will finally give out

6658831 prime minister kevin rudd should use his relationship with british prime minister gordon brown to convince the uk government to purchase the boomerang and donate it to australia in a gesture of friendship and to mark our shared heritage
6658832 the boomerang should be returned to kurnell as a symbol of that first meeting and so all australians have the opportunity to see it
6658833 having the boomerang back in kurnell will be an historic symbol of harmony between our two cultures and will help teach young australians about the importance of aboriginal culture

6658868 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
6658869 at worst theyre outright dangerous in stark contrast to claims made by the dutch research team and in the media we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
6658870 in fact our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously

6658918 our private life isnt the glamorous life that one would imagines from a bollywood couple i make him a quick breakfast and if he spends a half hour with me i am thrilled to be able to share a meal together at night we light a candle during dinner after i have put the children to bed and try to re create the romance in our lives
6658919 ronit is wonderful with the children i believe he is the best human on earth
6658920 hes a good listener even nonsense things that i gibber off to him he listens to and when i think hes really not listening he really is i just wish we could spend more time with each other
6658921 we are three sisters and we are an orthodox gujarati family and the only advice my mother told me when i was younger was to find a career whatever i wanted to do but most importantly the most important decision of my life was to find a good man and what she meant by that was not someone that was too monied although money is important but someone that would care and look after me and most importantly loves me more than i love him
6658922 though i think as women we tend to love our husbands unconditionally
6658923 i hope and pray the same emotion should be inside me as i feel today i am committed to my husband my inner knowing says that day will not happen ronit will not disappoint me
6658924 i think it was a holiday to venice we both were on the gondola and ronit started to serenade me with hindi songs amidst the sonnets of the violinist
6658925 each day we squeeze time to be together when hes not filming we like to spend time with the children having a quiet dinner or just reading and holding hands when he is filming i make it a point to send him a tiffin for his mid day break each day i instigate our off time if i know he has a couple of days break coming up we plan to slip away even to lonavala i think we both need to rejuvenate
6658926 i believe its important to workout and if ronit is working out i try to do the same our mantra is have healthy foods we enjoy vegetables and pasta also nice and spicy maharastrian cuisine we also try to pray together he has a wonderful character and i think its because of his strong belief in god

6658988 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6658989 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6658990 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6658991 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6659060 when it was first put to me in the spring or summer of 2007
6659061 i was told that eurostar wanted to make a feature film about kids possibly in paris or possibly in london places that the eurostar went to when i heard it was a feature film with commercial backing i thought its not really my cup of tea
6659062 my worry was that it was going to be shots of blokes in trains smiling patting kids on the head and saying have a nice day on the eurostar i couldnt quite understand why theyd asked me so i pulled out of the project
6659063 then i said they should speak to paul fraser the guy id co written with because hes worked on a couple of kids feature film scripts that are currently in development
6659064 so i was really happy read the script and it was fantastic i was quite baffled that they were going to give me carte blanche to make it as if it was my own film
6659065 i fell in love with it when i saw the relationship between the two boys
6659066 this idea of this rough renegade kid from the midlands and this sweet artistic lad from poland whos quite lonely they get forced together and fall in love with this french waitress it reminded me of a lot of new wave french cinema and i thought id like to have a go at it
6659067 we laid out this 10 day shoot and a couple of days rehearsal and when we started to rehearse things started to expand the father and son piotr and ireneusz were from poland and they gelled really quickly
6659068 the additional freedom that i had from eurostar sponsoring it was that it didnt matter how long or short it was so when i cut it i was able to simply make it work at the perfect length for the story in its own right
6659069 i decided to take a year off after this is england to take stock and look at doing a bigger project in my year off which was meant to be my quietest year
6659070 i made somers town then i made another film with paddy considine called le donk which was meant to be a short but turned into a feature
6659071 out of all of them somers town was the biggest surprise to me

6659122 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
6659123 as the obesity epidemic grows these tricky cases will keep on cropping up councils would step in to deal with an undernourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different if parents consistently place their children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right that a council should step in to keep the childs health under review
6659124 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services its a huge issue for public health but it also risks placing an unprecedented amount of pressure on council services
6659125 but in the worst cases the children would need to be put on at risk registers or taken into care
6659126 even then the care proceedings may well have been instigated because of related problems rather than exclusively because of their weight
6659127 can have very serious consequences for a childs health and the parental behaviour that leads to childhood obesity can be a form of neglect
6659128 children who are dangerously overweight should be brought into hospital where they can be given 24 hour care for several weeks or months but their parents should have access to them
6659129 it would be better to help the parents provide better nutrition for their child rather than break up the family

6659152 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6659153 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6659154 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6659155 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6659156 sesungguhnya seorang mukmin apabila bertemu dengan mukmin yang lain lalu ia mengucapkan salam dan mengambil tangannya untuk menjabatnya maka akan berguguran kesalahan kesalahan keduanya sebagaimana bergugurannya daun daun pepohonan
6659157 termasuk kesempurnaan tahiyyah ucapan salam adalah engkau menjabat tangan saudaramu
6659158 kepala salah seorang ditusuk dengan jarum dari besi itu lebih baik baginya daripada menyentuh wanita yang tidak halal baginya
6659159 dalam hadits ini ada ancaman yang keras bagi lelaki yang menyentuh wanita yang tidak halal baginya dan juga merupakan dalil haramnya berjabat tangan dengan para wanita karena jabat tangan tanpa diragukan masuk dalam pengertian menyentuh sungguh kebanyakan kaum muslimin di zaman ini ditimpa musibah dengan kebiasaan berjabat tangan dengan wanita dianggap sesuatu yang lazim bukan suatu kemungkaran pent di kalangan mereka ada sebagian ahlul ilmi seandainya mereka mengingkari hal itu hanya di dalam hati saja niscaya sebagian perkaranya akan menjadi ringan namun ternyata mereka menganggap halal berjabat tangan tersebut dengan beragam jalan dan takwil telah sampai berita kepada kami ada seorang tokoh besar di al azhar berjabat tangan dengan para wanita dan disaksikan oleh sebagian mereka hanya kepada allah subhanahu wa taala kita sampaikan pengaduan dengan asingnya ajaran islam ini di tengah pemeluknya sendiri bahkan sebagian organisasi organisasi islam berpendapat bolehnya jabat tangan tersebut mereka berargumen dengan apa yang tidak pantas dijadikan dalil dengan berpaling dari hadits ini4 dan hadits hadits lain yang secara jelas menunjukkan tidak disyariatkan jabat tangan dengan kaum wanita non mahram
6659160 wahai nabi apabila datang kepadamu wanita wanita yang beriman untuk membaiatmu
6659161 aisyah mengatakan siapa di antara wanita wanita yang beriman itu mau menetapkan syarat yang disebutkan dalam ayat tersebut
6659162 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam membaiat mereka hanya dengan mengucapkan
6659163 sesungguhnya aku tidak mau berjabat tangan dengan kaum wanita hanyalah ucapanku kepada seratus wanita seperti ucapanku kepada seorang wanita
6659164 tidaklah diragukan bahwa sentuhan tubuh dengan tubuh lebih kuat dalam membangkitkan hasrat laki laki terhadap wanita dan merupakan pendorong yang paling kuat kepada fitnah daripada sekedar memandang dengan mata 7 dan setiap orang yang adil mau berlaku jujur akan mengetahui kebenaran hal itu
6659165 tidak boleh berjabat tangan dengan wanita yang bukan mahram baik si wanita masih muda ataupun sudah tua dan sama saja baik yang menjabatnya itu anak muda atau kakek tua karena adanya bahaya fitnah ujian cobaan yang bisa didapatkan oleh masing masingnya
6659166 tidak ada bedanya baik jabat tangan itu dilakukan dengan ataupun tanpa penghalang karena keumuman dalil yang ada juga dalam rangka menutup celah celah yang mengantarkan kepada fitnah ujian cobaan
6659167 tidaklah aku tinggalkan setelahku fitnah yang lebih berbahaya bagi laki laki daripada fitnah wanita
6659168 secara umum tergeraknya syahwat disebabkan sentuhan kulit dengan kulit lebih kuat daripada sekedar melihat dengan pandangan mata tidak menyentuh bila seorang lelaki tidak dibolehkan memandang telapak tangan wanita yang bukan mahramnya lalu bagaimana dibolehkan ia menggenggam telapak tangan tersebut
6659169 tidak ada asalnya dalam syariat telah diriwayatkan dari sekelompok shahabat bahwa mereka melakukannya sebagian imam memberi rukhshah untuk melakukannya seperti al imam ahmad rahimahullahu dan selainnya akan tetapi al imam ahmad rahimahullahu berkata aku tidak memulai mengucapkannya kepada seseorang namun bila ada yang lebih dahulu mengucapkannya kepadaku aku pun menjawabnya karena menjawab tahiyyah itu wajib adapun memulai mengucapkan tahni ah bukanlah sunnah yang diperintahkan dan juga tidak dilarang siapa yang melakukannya maka ia punya contoh dan siapa yang meninggalkannya maka ia punya contoh
6659170 dan apabila kalian diberi ucapan salam penghormatan maka jawablah dengan yang lebih baik darinya atau balaslah dengan yang semisalnya
6659171 sungguh telah datang ahlul yaman mereka adalah orang orang yang paling halus lembut hatinya daripada kalian
6659172 mereka inilah yang pertama kali datang membawa mushafahah adat berjabat tangan

6659190 we label guys prospects or fourth outfielders or 4 a guys or injury prone like with luddy
6659191 he wanted me to know what he was doing how hard he was working how committed he was to find a place that would give him a chance
6659192 id like to think they were the results of playing the game hard or freak accidents to be injury free for three years in a row now

6659197 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6659198 we really dont have much of a reaction because we do not have many alcohol related incidents on campus
6659199 we were contacted to sign and decided we wouldnt sign even though we were sympathetic to some of the motivations that prompted it
6659200 were going to have a meeting of the vice presidents council next thursday and were going to talk about it
6659201 were going to pull in some of the people on campus who really are familiar with the issues
6659202 that is the extent of the statement we wish to say about it
6659203 i am not encouraging teenagers to drink that is not why i signed it
6659204 we have a drinking problem in the nation on college campuses the current law does not resolve it
6659205 you can sign up to die for our country but you cant drink
6659206 it doesnt make sense if you can make that choice you should be able to do both
6659207 the tendency to go overboard is because you dont know your limits
6659208 if its not forbidden you dont feel the need to go overboard
6659209 the issue is not going to go away or change with the age
6659210 and if college presidents believe it will they are just putting their heads in the sand
6659211 we are saddled with a very difficult enforcement problem and disabled to some extent to carrying on the education function the best way possible
6659212 once you go to college the expectation is that youre going to drink
6659213 rather than hide it these college presidents acknowledge the situation its definitely something we should think about
6659214 neither obama nor mccain owns the economy as an issue because theyve never focused on it really in ways that working class families would identify with
6659215 obama has always been about hope and change in a broad sense while mccain has always been about foreign policy and experience
6659216 it wasnt because she was lazy its because she was a single mom who was working and going to school at the same time trying to raise two kids trying to make a better life for herself and her family
6659217 dont be fooled by all this talk about class warfare we just want to make the economy fair so that everybodys got a chance not just some people
6659218 its unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation
6659219 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers
6659220 her addiction to illicit drugs is the explanation for her involvement
6659221 one of her young children was a potential prosecution witness in this case
6659222 climate change is going to mean big changes to the economy but they may not be bad changes
6659223 what were doing now is putting a price on carbon to become carbon fit and lean its like getting up early and exercising there will be some discomfort but in the long term well be better off it means creating more wealth not less
6659224 there could be a period where profits are constrained but on the other side of that the investment opportunities will be enormous
6659225 to take the world from its dependency on fossil fuels will create the greatest investment opportunity weve ever seen but well have to go through a period of adjustment first thats why we need early action rather than later
6659226 the first step is to take action as part of the developed world with a view to bringing in developing countries first of all china on the earliest possible timetable
6659227 in other words it may take a couple of years to get to where we would have if climate change hadnt existed
6659228 but its a relatively modest price to pay once the world starts adjusting to producing lower emissions it will set off such a wave of technological innovation that the economic cost probably wont even be noticed
6659229 history suggests technological adjustments and the economic blow out wont be as negative as people make out
6659230 its absolute nonsense to say we cant afford to address climate change its patently obvious world economies can adapt to factoring in new costs theyve always had to do that the price of oil went up about fivefold during the biggest boom market weve seen it wasnt high oil prices that caused the end of the boom but stupid lending practices
6659231 the cost of carbon emissions at the moment is being indirectly paid by everyone
6659232 putting a price on carbon will increase the costs of energy and therefore goods and services but it will be paid for directly
6659233 the most important thing is the 2020 target for emissions
6659234 we need a reasonable target and once we have that for the government to work towards a level global playing field by about 2020
6659235 some of the companies with the biggest carbon footprints have the most to gain
6659236 if they can do better than their competitors they will have an advantage
6659237 its hard to be definitive from what weve seen so far but i cant see carbon trading being especially negative particularly if companies are pro active
6659238 people are looking at companies and trying to ensure they have a good pricing position and management nimble enough to adapt to change you cant just dismiss dirty industries inside dirty industries there are smart dirty companies and ones that are not as adaptable
6659239 the day the government crystallises some of its plans for a trading system people will work out that some companies will have additional costs and others will have an advantage businesses will start reporting to potential investors especially where they have taken steps to do the right thing
6659240 when we have a scheme that connects with the global market carbon will be a valuable commodity
6659241 it will be like the oil price in the way it can have a significant impact on markets companies and ultimately peoples hip pockets and consumer sentiment
6659242 super funds understand it is probably the most significant long term risk to their members wealth generation but at the same time theres still an element of short termism
6659243 but as it gets brought into the economic system it will become a factor in investment decisions and an important thing for analysts to look at
6659244 the whole world is moving towards putting a premium on carbon look at the huge premium rio paid when it bought alcan it paid much more than alcans highest traded price and all the analysts wondered what theyd been smoking
6659245 but alcan is one of the lowest emission producers of aluminium and large bulk buyers increasingly need to buy low carbon aluminium
6659246 the institutions are getting involved but theyre not saying its important to be green
6659247 theyre saying climate change is a material commercial risk and they have to take measures to mitigate that risk
6659248 there will be all sorts of people running around offering you beaut investments in many cases people should be extremely wary because there will be many trying to cash in on sentiment and buzzwords its not that long ago we had the it bubble where we had some good companies but most have never been heard of since
6659249 if australia can get into the position of being a champion for cleaner technologies and have service and technology companies pushing sustainability and making it achievable then we can export that expertise it gets very exciting if we can improve our energy efficiency here we may be able to export it to countries such as china and india
6659250 a lot of money will need to be spent on infrastructure to meet the climate change challenges
6659251 you have to put the losers into the context of a world that is energy constrained and energy resource scarce
6659252 carbon trading is just telling them dont make out like bandits
6659253 if you have a 50 000 account balance we will be able to report how many kilograms of carbon dioxide are associated with that investment
6659254 if members are concerned about climate change they can do things like change the type of light bulbs they use but what about their super fund were telling them what we think the emissions are and will try to reduce them in five years if we work with the companies we invest in wed like to be able to go back to members and report lower emissions but the same type of investment returns
6659255 were not saying that we wont invest in a cement company or bhp or rio
6659256 but we will try to work with them to see what can be done to reduce emission levels
6659257 responses range from companies that absolutely understand the issues theyve measured their emissions know what they can do to avoid reduce or offset carbon use and are real leaders to those that dont respond either because they still dont accept climate change is a risk or theyre still trying to understand their position
6659258 that have most adequately demonstrated that they understand and have put in place strategies to manage the risks and opportunities of climate change
6659259 show how integrated climate change is to the business the companies in the index are the ones who can communicate to investors what theyre doing in regard to climate change theyre potentially a low risk group
6659260 the information isnt audited but theres generally a high correlation between the companies that are able to talk about the issues in a considered way and those that are genuinely doing something

6659280 his popularity is probably the no 1 athlete out here
6659281 it has been unbelievable to see how big he is as an athlete
6659282 i think its because of basketball of course but i think a lot of it is his personality also

6659394 there were concerns the locker had been tampered with prior to law enforcements arrival
6659395 the most difficult thing was finding replacements who just werent hired guns
6659396 we needed cool guys that could play and fortunately we found them
6659397 we found the troops but the question was how would we do in battle
6659398 we prevailed i never stopped believing that we could get this thing going again it reminds me of how things were when we broke it feels like that all over again were on the radio again who could have predicted that in some ways its like it was five years ago
6659399 it was a time musicians dream about it was incredible
6659400 you can handle it the barbs and lack of sales in many ways
6659401 it can be a little disturbing but the best way to deal with all of this is to remain positive its hard to be in a place like we were in 2002 it takes a lot of work and luck
6659402 there are so many groups that are completely forgotten were not one of those groups a lot of people dont realize it but puddle of mudd has existed for more than 15 years we didnt just form in 2002 im obviously in this group for the long haul
6659403 the next disc wont take so long were a tight knit group everybody in this band is staying together i just want to build on the momentum and keep making music with these guys for as long as possible
6659404 all four of us were going to do it but financially and logistically it just didnt work which was disappointing when we did that reunion tour four years ago it was fun to get back with the guys although its always better short term than long term
6659405 i thought it would be nice to have a photographic record of where ive been each day
6659406 it can be the simplest of things or the most amazing things
6659407 the first 10 years are with negative and from then on ive gone digital and leave them on the memory card and hope and pray the memory card doesnt deteriorate
6659408 we were surprised by how many people were interested in what happened to us
6659409 i yelled to my mother and she picked him up and held him
6659410 when she heard that he was ok she burst out crying
6659411 we wanted her to know that there were people who cared about her

6659426 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6659427 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6659428 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6659429 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6659430 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
6659431 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future

6659442 continue to lose staggering sums of money and drag down the rest of the business
6659443 the debtors continued willingness to operate amoney losing business that burns cash for the benefit of gm isbeyond comprehension
6659444 were always telling our manager we want to go to america
6659445 and it gets increasingly hard because of the finances theres not the money about anymore that there used to be
6659446 this gave us a chance to just come up here in america for a moment do a bit of touring and a little bit of sightseeing
6659447 really i think that until maybe 95 or so we thought we were finished as a group
6659448 we sort of thought that since our music looked old fashioned and no one was interested and suddenly there was a bit of a resurgence
6659449 it started in britain really because britain doesnt make any pop stars now that tour very much and people wanted to go out and see people whose faces they recognize from the tv and it just started from there
6659450 i think that america started doing the same thing and really americas very big for it now although we go to really odd places we go to brazil we do 80s shows in s o paulo that go very very well
6659451 the audience is a little bit younger than we expected this time
6659452 im not sure why that is whether maybe younger people are going out more but yeah a lot of young faces there its strange we toured with culture club in 98 and it was primarily middle age people this time its sort of a good mix
6659453 we turned up in minneapolis they said six of the songs of about twelve were worth doing and quite frankly they were right
6659454 they added four very good songs of theirs including human
6659455 i think we were very lucky to be using synthesizers when people werent using them much
6659456 so some of the distinctive sounds that just come from them are associated with us and certainly in dance music now theyre doing a very similar process to get their records that we were doing so were really quite happy to be a part of it
6659457 ini adalah hasil terbaik yang bisa kita peroleh di awal pertandingan kamboja memang sempat menekan dan melakukan pressing kepada pemain kita

6659471 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6659472 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6659473 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6659524 a partial eclipse of the moon will take place on august 16 the entire eclipse will be visible in most of europe and africa and partially visible in south america and australia during a lunar eclipse the earth comes between the sun and the moon casting its shadow on the moon eclipses always come in pairs and this eclipse follows the dramatic solar eclipse of august 1 eclipses are like big exclamation points and since this eclipse is in aquarius a sign that is focused on the workings of the larger group or community expect confusing leadership situations power struggles and sharp words in addition to the heightened emotions of this full moon an active pattern of planetary aspects also adds drama to this eclipse the placement of aquarius in your personal chart will define how it impacts your life over the next five months if aquarius is in your first or seventh house the eclipse will signal a period of personal development and growth and if aquarius is in your seventh house the focus will be on growth and development in your relationships an eclipse in the second house will always make you more aware of your attachments the things that you believe that you cannot survive without but an eclipse in the eighth house highlights your responsibilities to others both physically and emotionally when occurring in the third house you will be forced to confront fears and your communication style and in the ninth house you will be forced to consider the bigger picture of your life how do you want to grow and expand in the fifth or eleventh house the focus on the next five months will be on issues of individual expression and group participation in the fifth house the eclipse will stir up the creative urge or represent changes in relationships with children or with casual romances eclipses in the eleventh house can often indicate changes in relationships with our peers and friends if aquarius occupies your sixth or twelfth house the focus over the next five months will be on your health both physical and spiritual eclipses in the sixth house often make you aware of your physical needs and illness while in the twelfth house they highlight religious or spiritual needs

6659527 conclusiones clarificadoras de las causas y circunstancias de la tragedia
6659528 un fallo en el motor no es causa de un accidente
6659529 conclusiones clarificadoras de las causas y circunstancias de la tragedia
6659530 no cerrar las puertas a la cooperaci n con la alianza atl ntica
6659531 entre la especulaci n irresponsable y las explicaciones incompletas o el silencio que s lo sirven para alimentar las conjeturas e incluso la frustraci n existe un terreno intermedio que es el simple relato factual de los hechos
6659532 a salvo de lo que pueda decidir el juez encargado del caso informar con mayor precisi n de lo que observ el piloto y de las comprobaciones t cnicas que se realizaron son una vez m s hechos simples hechos de los que las autoridades y la propia compa a no har an mal en dar cuenta con precisi n dejando que los investigadores ofrezcan en su d a la explicaci n
6659533 la cuesti n es c mo es posible una aver a de esta naturaleza que resulta muy poco usual podr a haberse detectado este grav simo fallo del motor izquierdo previamente se hicieron correctamente las ltimas revisiones del aparato hubo alg n error de mantenimiento se pod a en suma haber evitado la cat strofe
6659534 por mucho que los directivos de spanair quieran eludir el asunto no se puede menospreciar esa advertencia del sepla de que el caos operativo pod a acabar afectando a la seguridad
6659535 exigen que se esclarezca tambi n si esas causas eran evitables si hubo o no fallos de mantenimiento
6659536 lo razonable es pensar mientras no se demuestre otra cosa que el origen de esta tragedia se mueve en el terreno meramente t cnico y que las autoridades y expertos encargados del caso dar n las respuestas adecuadas
6659537 es preciso que la compa a spanair se pronuncie con mayor claridad sobre el futuro que ten a previsto para el avi n siniestrado porque esta compa a hab a preparado un plan de retirada de una parte de su flota
6659538 la gesti n informativa de estas tragedias forma parte tambi n de la responsabilidad de las autoridades ante la sociedad y las v ctimas
6659539 no debe inducir conclusiones precipitadas y menos a n vincular el desastre con la situaci n de la compa a spanair
6659540 debe lamentarse la insensibilidad de los dirigentes ol mpicos del coi ante las tragedias de la vida cotidiana
6659541 expresa fielmente el sentimiento de solidaridad que recorre toda espa a hacia quienes han perdido a sus seres queridos
6659542 tomaron r pidamente las riendas con sus gabinetes de crisis
6659543 en el cap tulo negativo figura por m ritos propios la compa a a rea que tiene la obligaci n de poner todos los medios necesarios para aclarar cuanto antes las causas del accidente
6659544 se extiende a aviaci n civil que debe dar cumplida informaci n sobre las condiciones de seguridad del fat dico vuelo
6659545 la l gica zozobra de los familiares y la obligaci n de aclararles con la mayor diligencia posible por qu sus seres queridos encontraron la muerte en el vuelo de spanair no deben desembocar ni en interpretaciones a n dudosas ni en la creaci n irresponsable de expectativas que acaben desmontadas por los hechos
6659546 se ha equivocado al prohibir la expresi n de una solidaridad que forma parte de los valores esenciales del deporte y que este organismo deber a ser el primero en promover
6659547 innecesaria muestra de intransigencia ante una situaci n excepcional y extrema por la tragedia a rea de madrid
6659548 la nica soluci n es que sean los propios europeos quienes asuman esa carga no ignorando el peligro

6659553 i hadnt really thought about it just being together with her was almost as if almost almost like a drug
6659554 thats perhaps an extreme way of saying it i just wanted to live an obscure life in baltimore
6659555 it was given to me by the one person to whom ive always looked up to one person whom ive known since i was small
6659556 if i were you id be thinking about whether this job is what you want it seems you want something more senior and a bigger role so maybe this isnt the role for you
6659557 if i go to pb its going to be so loud and there will be drunk kids everywhere
6659558 damn drunk kids runnin around all crazy dont they have jobs dont they have responsibilities
6659559 why should we be forced from our house while our attackers can walk freely
6659560 we the community of kampung pulo demand the campus be closed and dissolved
6659561 people are still tolerant but there is a growing suspicion among muslims of others
6659562 the state has some responsibility for this growing intolerance namely by not upholding the law
6659563 how can you study here i only followed 20 of my last lesson its difficult to concentrate
6659564 other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6659565 we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6659566 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment
6659567 all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6659568 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6659569 them crazy celebrities matt damon had another baby girl ridiculous
6659570 you cant let the public know you read bwe their stuff is too subversive brilliant and hilarious and their editors are way too attractive lets be safe and pretend you read the economist instead
6659571 neither obama or mccain has bwe in their google reader little help kucinich
6659572 we know that the industry is facing these acute challenges and i cant say with any certainty that there wont be further announcements in regard to job losses
6659573 i do not regard our national debt as unduly alarming
6659574 weve overcome things far worse than what is going on right now
6659575 what concerns me more than anything is our savings rate
6659576 the problem is getting the public understanding and the political will to do something about it
6659577 the important thing to remember is that the pie gets larger over time and theres more to divide up
6659578 seis cosas sin importancia que nos hagan felices en nuestro d a a d a

6659581 this extra package is a clear indication that we are continuing and reinforcing our commitment to the palestinian people
6659582 i hope that other donors will continue to make every effort to fulfill their pledges or even go beyond as we do today if not the situation of the palestinian authority will continue to be precarious
6659583 wenn freiheit berhaupt etwas bedeutet dann das recht anderen leuten das zu sagen was sie nicht h ren wollen

6659586 machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
6659587 to find a way to cut the last cord in mobile devices and someday enable wireless power in intel based platforms
6659588 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6659589 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6659590 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6659591 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6659592 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6659593 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6659594 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6659595 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6659596 strectch not forth your hand and touch the lords anointed

6659598 we need to have this country defended and we need new people trained
6659599 we need new equipment and we will work very closely with the u s to get all of this
6659600 we talked about this date a week ago and russia sticks to its commitments in terms of deadlines
6659601 we have taken all this equipment to a certain place and are guarding it
6659602 i dont know what the fate of these hummers will be
6659603 saakashvili bears responsibility for how the situation will develop in the future
6659604 we respect the california commission and the job they do we always enjoy working with them and work very well together the illegal use of steroids is a problem in all major sports including mixed martial arts we certainly do not condone the use of steroids
6659605 but we also support trust and have confidence in our fighter antonio silva who has denied ever taken any illegal substance including steroids and is prepared to challenge the results of the california commission
6659606 pappan min er mye st rre og sterkere enn pappan din s
6659607 it was a huge act of aggression on the part of the georgian army
6659608 this is not yet a known story to the world
6659609 but i am sure that every day every hour the truth will be coming through
6659610 but i just found that its not as black and white as i originally thought
6659611 we had no idea what had happened my mouth dropped open
6659612 we have to fly to the canary islands were from there and that about sums it up
6659613 the proliferation of crime could not have happened without years of protection and impunity
6659614 and the first step is getting it out of our own house
6659615 has advanced bit by bit through fear intimidation corruption and authorities who have decided to protect criminals
6659616 the proliferation of crime cant be understood without the cover of impunity
6659617 but they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions
6659618 what my presence can do is to identify any final obstacles
6659619 its a chance for me to sit with the prime minister and really get a sense of if there is anything else we need to do from washington to get to closure
6659620 project the message free tibet and additional messages that would have been three stories high
6659621 james has always been dedicated to providing tools for free speech
6659622 the best thing is to get attention just spread the word we need to make sure they release them
6659623 im sure he knew full well what the risks were all signs suggest the goal was to draw maximum attention to the nature of chinese repression
6659624 my main concern was to clear my name not about what punishment bertolino would get
6659625 i told the chief i would smile and take it for all the stuff i probably got away with over the years
6659626 there were no injuries and the cause is still under investigation
6659627 the owner complained of having electrical problems in the past
6659628 were looking into that it appears maybe it started in the kitchen area thats where the breaker box was
6659629 his cousin said vincent was playing in the ditch and he was going to go back to call his friends to where he was playing
6659630 it doesnt appear she was speeding and she didnt have a stop sign
6659631 my family hears emergency crews sirens blasting every few hours as they cart accident victims off to the hospital this is concerning
6659632 no prisoner of the fine white lines on the freeway
6659633 cause summers here and the time is right for cycling in the street
6659634 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
6659635 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
6659636 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6659637 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6659638 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6659639 sorry about that you were making a fuss earlier and i didnt want us to be disturbed
6659640 as i said sorry about that you probably dont feel the pain from the stitches yet the cocktail i gave you knocked you out effectively im not well versed in pharmacology or anatomy but still not too shabby for a gifted amateur if you find yourself getting thirsty however feel free to imbibe from the water bottle directly in front of you
6659641 i made sure that we would be undisturbed blake i have much to say and not much time to say it
6659642 well just enough time then time enough for a story blake
6659643 my name is peter dr peter simpson at your service and you are officer blake donnelly late of the boston police department
6659644 im going to tell you a story blake this story is about a young girl named bridget and how she is the most important person in the world
6659645 bridget was a beautiful girl one of the most beautiful girls in her neighborhood really a good many young boys and older men watched her i assure you one watched her more intently than others though
6659646 she was walking home from her friends house one night
6659647 her screams brought help eventually no one really got a good look at the tall man who dragged her away who ripped her dress who violated her in that alley a mere block from her house bloody and broken she was taken to the nearby hospital the police eventually came and took her statement clucking their tongues and telling her that she really shouldnt have been walking in such a dangerous neighborhood at night
6659648 at any rate bridget ran away from home the next night
6659649 she could have had an abortion i suppose but she never did call it a by product of her upbringing
6659650 the young boy was pegged at an early age to be a prodigy mathematics physics history engineering anything he put his mind to the boy could accomplish he was smarter than any ten of his contemporaries put together
6659651 his mother always let him know just how proud she was of his accomplishments she took small waitress jobs to make ends meet and to afford the preparatory academy that the boy attended they were happy by most accounts
6659652 she found the lump on her thirty fourth birthday so small a thing yet so deadly the cancer needed only a few weeks to kill her she was buried in a small plot on a hill overlooking the bay the boy was alone truly alone for the first time in his life
6659653 the boy was packing her things some nights later donating much to charity but keeping a few keepsakes for himself when he found a old manila folder in a locked drawer the folder contained a police report from boston the boy read the report
6659654 and that night the boy knew what he had to do he realized sitting on his dead mothers bed that the world was an unjust place that no amount of good intentions could ever change the nature of the world around him but he would find justice he would make his own justice
6659655 he studied intensely immersing himself in advanced physics and engineering learning the structure of the universe and finding new ways to bend it to his will
6659656 and he succeeded beyond his wildest dreams he mastered time and space with his keen mind and his advanced technology
6659657 i think you misunderstand me blake i ask merely to ascertain that you have heard of the mysterious case of the ripper i dont imagine that there is a single member of the law enforcement establishment who isnt familiar with the case in some way but ive learned that you can never be too careful in making assumptions
6659658 one of the most fascinating aspects of the rippers killing spree is the speed with which his murderous quest ended
6659659 this seemed to the young man i mentioned earlier as a good starting point to begin his quest for justice he took his inventions and his knowledge of the past and threw himself backwards through time he arrived in the middle of the whitechapel murders and waited for his opportunity
6659660 on the night of november 8 1888 he found the creature responsible for the brutal deaths of five women the event went far more smoothly than even he expected the ripper was completely surprised when the dark man came out of the shadows and plunged the dagger into his chest
6659661 of course now the young man had a dilemma what would he do with the body there could be no evidence that there had ever been a body here in the first place and now there was physical evidence of a pair of murders one of a victim and the other of her murderer
6659662 here again the young mans depth of knowledge held an answer
6659663 after his initial success the young man thought a great deal as to how his technological advances could be put to the service of all mankind
6659664 years passed the young man spent his time tracking down the worst that humanity could offer time meant nothing to him he could easily skip across the years and find the predators watching and waiting for the right moment to strike then jettisoning their rotting corpses into the sun
6659665 one day many years later as sending so many ambulatory nightmares to their just rewards the man looked at himself in the mirror and realized that he had become a monster
6659666 but i still had one last bit of business to attend one last score to settle for my mother after all those years
6659667 i tracked you across the years blake youve been hiding behind that badge for years preying on young girls finding you and catching you was easy i was the one who called out and scared you away blake i followed you to the hospital to take my mothers report
6659668 you had some nerve lecturing the woman you just finished raping you son of a bitch
6659669 i gave much thought as to what i might have inherited from you but all i could deduce was an unending cycle of pain and blood and darkness and thats not a proper inheritance so i devised one of my own making blake one of the side benefits of
6659670 well thats my story ive destroyed all of my inventions and my backup notes and the remainder of my work resides in this box
6659671 all that i am is here in this container and soon even we wont be here our orbit will soon take into the fire hundreds of years before the arabs began making instruments that could see into the heavens no one will remember us no one will miss us a fitting end for the both of us dont you think father
6659672 part of the instructions included adding bleach to uranium 238 in a bucket and rotating it around ones head for 45 minutes
6659673 on the totality of the open and closed evidence before the court it is clear that the united states authorities have never informed either

6659676 who knew we all thought that 6 was the right loss assumption that was what experience suggested and what the rating agencies used
6659677 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6659678 so far everything that has been received demonstrates we have no problem for the eligibility of the competitors
6659679 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6659680 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6659681 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6659682 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6659683 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6659684 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6659685 the alleged assaults took place in a tiny space occupied by three people and that while the complainant testified she screamed the friend heard nothing
6659686 mr hnidan and mr marriot conducted themselves in a competent professional fair objective impartial and ethical manner in good faith in the honest discharge of their duties
6659687 at all times det glasgows actions were motivated by her desire to diligently faithfully and to the best of her ability fulfil her duties and obligations as a police officer
6659688 the defendants maliciously recklessly and intentionally abused the process of the court by proceeding with the prosecution with reckless indifference to the guilt or innocence of the accused

6659714 its not so much that people think the russians will cut anybody off its more that the market was in a slide and there were questions of whether wed pierce the 100 psychological level we were creeping toward it
6659715 with current opec production well above the expected demand for opec crude there is potential for a sharp build in crude oil inventories
6659716 in light of these ongoing changes in the market opec will continue to closely monitor market developments ahead of the upcoming ministerial meeting in september
6659717 is now such that only a price rally back to well above 120 a barrel is likely to be able to halt a substantial removal of opec crude output from the market
6659718 should prices move back up into the 120s and look steady then a cut is less likely
6659719 the russia georgia situation remains unresolved and is contributing to increased bellicosity between russia and nato as well as russia and the u s
6659720 russia is well aware that its intransigence is contributing to another run up in oil prices certainly a favorable development as far as their economy is concerned
6659721 but we dont want to downplay the threat of russia using all its oil and gas supply as an economic tool to en force events

6659724 its unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation
6659725 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers
6659726 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down

6659731 as far as the drug plan and the pharmacy legislation are concerned the bpa represented the interests of pharmacies and pharmacists
6659732 we ensured that what was done was done in their best interest because pharmacists and pharmacies all want and need to make a profit to sustain their businesses
6659733 firstly it would offer our membership and other health care professionals continuing education opportunities in disease management and pharmacy practice
6659734 secondly to further discuss the way forward as we embark on the formation of the pharmacy council that will follow the passing of the draft pharmacy legislation and the repeal of the current pharmacy act and to further develop and empower our membership and all of our clients as we embrace governments initiative to implement the national chronic disease management pre scri ption drug plan

6659774 lo firmado implica as nom s hacernos cargo de una deuda de u s 900 millones
6659775 sentarse frente a marsans sin establecer un valor cierto de la empresa y sin ninguna alternativa es regalar la negociaci n

6659801 the defense is here to tell you these acts did not occur as the prosecution says
6659802 its not the best way to preserve the memory of chinese pioneers
6659803 but what we are saying is there are some occasional acts and instances where people are not getting treated fairly based on the color of their skin so we have to get a handle on it as objectively as we can
6659804 there is no more critical issue confronting the next president than the safety of all americans
6659805 the harsh reality is that in the years since 2001 more than 99 000 americans have been murdered and more than eight million have been the victims of violent crime the united states needs a strategic plan that embraces the reality that protecting our communities depends on our ability to fight both crime and terrorism
6659806 our nations homeland security focus must be redirected to americas hometowns and neighborhoods if our children grandchildren and great grandchildren are to enjoy safe communities and declining crime rates
6659807 the preservation of the fabric of america requires that the next administration meaningfully engage this issue early next year
6659808 president johnsons 1965 commission on law enforcement and administration of justice brought us new ways of measuring crime an emphasis on research needed to combat crime in a free society and evidence of what crime prevention and control programs worked
6659809 a new commission would do all of this and given the research base we now have to work with establish a firmer foundation for confronting crime and terrorism in the 21st century
6659810 until we look at each individual case and dig into the narratives to see why tasers were used we are not going to be able to tell

6659820 in all topics mr obama displays a similar worried serious looking facial pattern even when talking about more positive subjects his facial expressions do not signal positive affective states
6659821 there is an element of the fact that he is on the edges of his comfort zone here
6659822 going into a presidential campaign is not something he has done before and you could say it is written all over his face
6659823 the dominating attitude as transmitted by his vocal style is that of concern and sincere involvement
6659824 his smile is often not fully developed ie his cheek raising muscles do not participate enough in the expression of positive affect to be perceived as genuine

6659846 everybody wants to know who the starting quarterback will be
6659847 i dont know i have no idea everybody looks good to me
6659848 i thought i played well and i thought we played well as a unit
6659849 i thought as a unit we had been playing all right we just hadnt been scoring points finally we kind of got over that and put up 20 points in the first half which was good
6659850 hes our quarterback and i think he can play good football for us but it was good to see him validate that tonight
6659851 wolfy es muy tranquilo y educado cuando ve la puerta abierta se pone en alerta y espera que le soltemos la correa para que pueda salir es un personaje

6659853 we really dont have much of a reaction because we do not have many alcohol related incidents on campus
6659854 we were contacted to sign and decided we wouldnt sign even though we were sympathetic to some of the motivations that prompted it
6659855 were going to have a meeting of the vice presidents council next thursday and were going to talk about it
6659856 were going to pull in some of the people on campus who really are familiar with the issues
6659857 that is the extent of the statement we wish to say about it
6659858 i am not encouraging teenagers to drink that is not why i signed it
6659859 we have a drinking problem in the nation on college campuses the current law does not resolve it
6659860 you can sign up to die for our country but you cant drink
6659861 it doesnt make sense if you can make that choice you should be able to do both
6659862 the tendency to go overboard is because you dont know your limits
6659863 if its not forbidden you dont feel the need to go overboard
6659864 the issue is not going to go away or change with the age
6659865 and if college presidents believe it will they are just putting their heads in the sand
6659866 we are saddled with a very difficult enforcement problem and disabled to some extent to carrying on the education function the best way possible
6659867 once you go to college the expectation is that youre going to drink
6659868 rather than hide it these college presidents acknowledge the situation its definitely something we should think about
6659869 we need to have this country defended and we need new people trained
6659870 we need new equipment and we will work very closely with the u s to get all of this
6659871 we talked about this date a week ago and russia sticks to its commitments in terms of deadlines
6659872 we have taken all this equipment to a certain place and are guarding it
6659873 i dont know what the fate of these hummers will be
6659874 saakashvili bears responsibility for how the situation will develop in the future
6659875 we really need to try to pursue any potential new revenue streams possible
6659876 its not about trying to fill all the space we have it really isnt
6659877 to me its drawing the line almost as we go
6659878 i do find it offensive that this is another captive audience ploy
6659879 if the school district was flush with money there wouldnt be a need to look into additional revenue streams unfortunately thats not the case
6659880 the benefits of increased revenue to the district outweigh the negatives
6659881 what my presence can do is to identify any final obstacles
6659882 its a chance for me to sit with the prime minister and really get a sense of if there is anything else we need to do from washington to get to closure
6659883 its about the same number of people who were asking they were just asking for more help
6659884 its the higher costs of things out in the world
6659885 its choices in life maybe you skimp someplace else but our families know education is an investment
6659886 when the economy is sort of mushy like this i think people tend to move around
6659887 its the extra things its the uniforms and the lunch program
6659888 its more people just saying gosh i just need help with the little things
6659889 for whats been happening in the economy we seem to be doing as well or better as weve done in recent years
6659890 this is not going to be one of the things that families are going to eliminate from a family budget early on
6659891 we may be impacted by the economic status as early as next year

6659908 for us rock climbing trivializes the site for the sake of sport
6659909 the access fund has reviewed the usfss closure of cave rock and believes the decision is unconstitutional as a result the access fund has been left with no alternative other than to file a lawsuit on behalf of the climbing community
6659910 banning rock climbing at cave rock to support native american spiritual practices is an unconstitutional establishment of religion

6659912 the washoe believe that the presence of anyone at cave rock except a few select washoe shaman endanger the lives of all people
6659913 the washoe consider no part of cave rock as more or less special but that all of its parts are equally important and that hiking fishing scenic viewing stargazing and other low impact activities disturb the traditional users of the property

6659950 in 1996 the chicago public schools were scheduled to hold the fourth election of local school council lsc representatives since the school reform of act sic of 1988 was passed as in the past two elections support from the central office of the chicago public schools appeared to be minimal
6659951 until that is members of the collaborative coalesced with school reform groups around the city and began to put pressure on the chicago public schools central office to promote the elections both by recruiting enough candidates for the open seats so that contested elections would be held and by urging parents and community members to vote
6659952 part of their effort was to seek funding to support efforts at the school level to locate and elect active lsc members the cac board was asked in early 1996 to approve funds for a citywide coalition of local organizations who agreed to work on both candidate and voter turnout for the 1996 elections

6659955 a new rfp for leadership development was issued in june 1997 to address the challenges interest in organizing an informed constituency of parents and community residents who will actively support and participate in educational changes in their local schools the rfp went through a number of revisions as both the board and collaborative discussed its goals and implementation the initiative is a critical aspect of the work of the challenge as it seeks to increase not only numbers of parents and community residents who are actively engaged in changing their schools but also participants who are knowledgeable of promising and successful educational academic practices in schools
6659956 has been the most elusive to date with no major progress to report at this time
6659957 the challenge began its work in 1995 at the same time a dramatic change in the leadership and management of the chicago public schools took place the illinois state legislature awarded complete control of the schools to the mayor of chicago in 1995 a new management team and reform board of trustees was installed and a major emphasis began on administration financial stability and accountability measures that are tied to specific test scores the challenge began its program at the time the central administration of the public schools took off in a different direction
