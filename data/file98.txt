980002 as a kid growing up in the 1960s in new york my experience was that everyone was conscious of ethnicity despite this ethnic jokes were accepted among friends as were ethnic slurs the concept that one couldnt joke about such things was considered absurd even as young people we were quite in touch with the cultural idiosyncrasies of our varied ethnic groups some of which could be pretty inane we played off of ethnic stereotypes with relish what mattered was that in a fight we were there for one another when the bigots within our own ethnic groups disparaged us for fraternizing with wops polacks micks spics or coons we told them to go to hell

980011 we had an afternoon game in milwaukee on thursday and we get in late and have a day game on friday
980012 be the biggest loss of my career to right now
980013 it is a different burden for me i can tell you i have two careers most players dont have that experience you play here for the professional league the nba the best league in the world if you win titles in this league that would be wonderful
980014 being in the olympics is a national honor its a dream i have when i am young it is obligation and an expectation that i have from my homeland the whole country is focused on these games in beijing basketball is a big game in china
980015 i would say i am about 60 to 70 percent and that is frustrating i am sure now that i will play in the olympics
980016 but i wont be in my best shape i know that and that is disappointing
980017 this is about different cultures different backgrounds and bringing all people different ways of thinking about things
980018 i cant say that any side is wrong americans say the rockets pay my salary no problem i like the rockets whatever uniform i wear i play 100 percent
980019 for china they have to understand that my loyalty to my country will never change but now i have another group of people in america that i need to take care of these people the chinese fans and american fans are not connected they do not understand how each other think i am the one who is connected i am in the middle that is the important goal of the olympics to bring different people together
980020 obviously a medal is always a dream when youre playing in the olympics
980021 youre standing there and you have a medal it doesnt matter what color you have but to be honest we are not at that level yet especially with the injuries to me and to yi jianlian i am not sure of our fitness we can make some history if we get into the 7th or 6th spot but i think 8th is about where we are
980022 if we win that first game i would quit right away i would say im getting out of here im not playing basketball anymore if we beat usa in game 1 that would be the top i can do no more
980023 i was a very young player and got my first taste of the olympics in 2000 at sydney i played in athens in 2004 and now this is my home country and the highest special honor in 2008 enough i think why would i need to play in london in 2012
980024 my parents do not talk about this but it is a story i have heard from people who are friends of my parents
980025 when my mom lost her chance to play in the olympics instead she had me that year if she had played in the olympics i would probably be two years younger now or maybe not born at all
980026 the first time i really watched the olympics and understood was 1996 in atlanta at that time i was practicing with the shanghai sharks junior team i remember waking up at 3 a m to watch china play argentina on tv we won that game and my parents told me it was a big big event wang zhi zhi played in that game and played well at that time i thought one day i could play in the olympics
980027 when you have the flag in your hand you feel like you have a whole country of people in your grasp and of course you feel the expectation it is the pressure that i have continued to feel every day since i came to the nba and now going back home for the olympics it is such extreme focus
980028 a lot of the people who were living there and all across china were so excited earlier this year about the olympics now 2008 has brought this to us first as the year passes it is difficult to forget we cannot forget we cannot just celebrate games and the olympics when we still have this suffering from the earthquake
980029 in the last several years ive worked with the china youth development foundation
980030 they are focused on building schools for kids in poor areas giving out scholarships last summer we had a successful
980031 at that time besides the money we raised i began thinking that it would be a very good idea to have my own foundation the original plan was to wait until after the olympics to announce it and get it started i would have more time then but the earthquake hit i watched the news i felt so sad i felt helpless in a way and i knew i had to do something right away i can do something to help
980032 there are a lot of different ways to think about things there are republicans and democrats in america there are different parties everywhere many different ideas
980033 but if you are not going then you lost a chance to tell people what you think and we have lost a chance to communicate with you
980034 i think back to when they started the modern olympics in athens in 1896 it was a beautiful idea to put people together again to make friendship and share the honor and share everything
980035 they stopped wars for the olympics they laid down their arms for the games right now war looks like a part of our life in this world but hopefully no wars no bombs no gunshots in those three weeks of the olympics maybe it is a dream it is my wish
980036 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
980037 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
980038 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
980039 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
980040 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
980041 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
980042 we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident we will have a safe and peaceful olympic games
980043 it is still the case that those who are already well qualified are the ones who get offered the training opportunities first sehrbrock said and people over age 45 are encouraged less than the younger workers are she added
980044 bonos philanthropy efforts are self righteous ineffective and counter productive
980045 its time for bono to step down well all pledge donations to the global fund but no pledges are collected until bono retires from public life
980046 if he wants to moan bland melodies hell have to do it quietly in his bedroom if he wants to fight aids he can make a direct donation instead of buying a sweatshop gap t shirt
980047 as the pledges grow bono will have to decide what matters more fighting aids effectively or him being the movements frontman
980048 this is a fantastic deal and an exciting time for top up tv

980050 eva and victoria are obsessed with the game and spend most evenings going out for a civilised meal and then getting stuck into a meaty tournament

980060 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
980061 the blogs were a bit out of control were very mindful of the media coverage and blogs in controlling misinformation all i can say is were going to continue to stay on top of it the misinformation that came out over the weekend fed a lot of depositors fears
980062 i think its going to be months that were working our way through this period clearly months but again its a safe banking system a sound banking system our regulators are on top of it this is a very manageable situation
980063 access to capital and credit is essential to growth if that access is restrained or blocked the economic system takes a hit
980064 the exact words were were saying no to almost everybody
980065 this is why god made banks for this kind of transaction this is going to slow down the american economy
980066 before they wouldnt verify income and they were loose on the valuations of collateral
980067 now theyre tightening down on the ability to repay they go off the reservation and now they come back to basics its preservation for many of them at this point its survival
980068 theres been a lot of disruption in the credit market and a lot of traditional lenders have really tightened up
980069 before some of the standards they lent on were weak but we think they have overshot and gone too far on the other end
980070 god is smiling on this factory were at such an exciting inflection point and this is what a bank is supposed to do theres sand in the gears
980071 banks will be much more cautious and keep raising the bar and that will lead to an outright decline in total commercial and industrial loans
980072 banks clearly have to rebuild their capital base theyre going to look a bit more nervously before they make those loans

980074 if they cant borrow to employ people then weve got a mess on our hands
980075 bring the revolution in outsourcing and branding that he had been part of in the corporate world into the heart of the u s military
980076 our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime
980077 or indeed by the fighting men of world war ii and korea we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
980078 government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem
980079 the expansion of private i e mainly corporate power and the selective abdication of governmental responsibility for the well being of the citizenry
980080 the privatization of public services and functions manifests the steady evolution of corporate power into a political form into an integral even dominant partner with the state it marks the transformation of american politics and its political culture from a system in which democratic practices and values were if not defining at least major contributory elements to one where the remaining democratic elements of the state and its populist programs are being systematically dismantled
980081 the separate bookkeeping and accountability devised for blackwater dyncorp triple canopy and similar outfits was part of a careful displacement of oversight from congress to the vice president and the stewards of his policies in various departments and agencies to have much of the work parceled out to private companies who are unaccountable to army rules or military justice meant among its other advantages that the cost of the war could be concealed beyond all detection
980082 bill clinton picked up the cudgel where the conservative ronald reagan left off and took it deep into services once considered inherently governmental including high risk military operations and intelligence functions once reserved only for government agencies by the end of clintons first term more than 100 000 pentagon jobs had been transferred to companies in the private sector among them thousands of jobs in intelligence by the end of his second term in 2001 the administration had cut 360 000 jobs from the federal payroll and the government was spending 44 percent more on contractors than it had in 1993
980083 outsourcing as a virtual joint venture between house majority leader newt gingrich and clinton
980084 boldest privatization agenda put forth by any president to date

980086 every purchase you make with a credit card every magazine subscription you buy and medical prescription you fill every web site you visit and every e mail you send or receive every bank deposit you make every trip you book and every event you attend all these transactions and communications will go into what the defense department describes as a virtual centralized grand database
980087 so many former intelligence officers joined the private sector during the 1990s that by the turn of the century the institutional memory of the united states intelligence community now resides in the private sector thats pretty much where things stood on september 11 2001

980105 all we want is somewhere for the senior citizens to go monday through friday
980106 a lot of seniors donated their time to build this center

980119 damals am everest hatten ein sturm und der tod von zwei bergf hrern zu der trag die gef hrt am k2 war es eine eislawine die den r ckweg versperrte fakt ist dass den kletterern jeweils die erfahrung fehlte um sich selbst ndig aus der situation zu befreien

980129 she probably e mailed about 6 100 times and i answered each one back personally

980136 yes it was difficult conditions to bat it was nibbling

980141 we agree completely that bacterial pneumonia played a major role in the mortality of the 1918 pandemic
980142 the 1918 pandemic is considered to be and clearly is something unique and its widely understood to be the most lethal natural event that has occurred in recent human history
980143 the bottom line is we think the influenza virus itself was necessary but not sufficient to cause most of the deaths
980144 everyone is focused exclusively on the virus and thats probably not the best idea
980145 the idea of stockpiling bacterial vaccines and antibiotics is under serious consideration

980149 for most consumers if you want to keep it simple and you dont travel a lot cash is king in my opinion but one card doesnt fit all and its a matter of finding which card fits your lifestyle and your budget
980150 its basically up to the merchant to properly code the transaction so it fits into the reward programs list of qualified stores you shouldnt go into cash back cards expecting to get it on every purchase
980151 studies have show that consumers spend more on reward cards than plain jane credit cards and moreover consumers spend more on credit cards than on debit cards you have to be disciplined and shrewd about it

980447 it may be a low priority in the scheme of the dns vulnerability but if all my servers are os x it matters within the mac audience it matters

980473 this technique could give us remarkable control over light and that would spell out amazing things for the future in terms of what we could do with that light
980474 there has been a lot of interest in scaling down optical devices its the holy grail for the future of communications
980475 its really a very simple geometry and i was surprised that no one had come up with it before
980476 previously if you wanted to transmit light at a smaller scale you would lose a lot of energy along the path to retain more energy youd have to make the scale bigger these two things always went against each other now this work shows there is the possibility to gain both of them
980477 we are pulling optics down to the length scales of electrons and that means we can potentially do some things we have never done before
980478 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games

980488 time will tell but i hope it wont restrict the way i play ive been successful with my style and i would be foolish to change that
980489 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
980490 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
980491 that was a bit unbelievable and it took the security a good five minutes to get out of there

980538 what fascinated me about watching these boys on the cctv footage at luton was their youth and the fact that they knew they were going to die
980539 i wanted to know what did they think about as they travelled to london did they think about england
980540 well this is totally effed up my son decided that it would be a good idea to update the ps3 and he did 2 nights ago without me knowing it well now anything bluray does not play nothing doesn t even recognize the damn disk is there anything i can do
980541 installed this newest update and now nothing works can not read disks at all we have done the system restore etc now have to wait while it gets shipped to sony to fix it very upsetting fairly new ps3 5 months in excellent condition and was working perfectly prior to update extremely frustrating
980542 downloaded the update and all my saves on cod 4 single player have gone and when i name my perks online as soon as i switch my ps3 off they disappear and have to name them again
980543 im looking over my schedule between now and fight night and im like holy who booked all this
980544 but seriously ive been doing this for a while as far as the fighting goes im new at it but as far as the business side goes ive been doing it for a while and for me its part of the job and i came to understand that a long time ago
980545 i got so excited then for mazzagatti to stop the fight kinda threw a monkey wrench into my rhythm a little bit and then you can chalk it up to a little bit of inexperience i had frank on the mat and then i stood up which was pretty foolish of me i think frank will be the first one to admit that i had him up against the ropes and i think he was scared s tless he was reaching at anything out there and he grabbed it and he got me but thats the beauty of mixed martial arts
980546 im in a spot where there might be the toughest son of a bitch out there but nobody knows his name and hes climbing the ranks and here youve got a guy like myself who is a household name all across the world from the business side of things ive got to make the right business decisions and at the same time on the fighting side of things i dont want any tomato cans either
980547 i definitely watched the jake obrien fight and it came to my mind right away when the fight was announced but i think every fighters either going to improve their game or lose their game after every fight
980548 heath has had some battles getting into the octagon and proving himself but i think im going to get the best heath herring come august 9th heath has got a lot to lose in this fight too so i think theres a lot on the line for the both of us
980549 i think people get their guard up right away when somebody wants to jump into something when theyre not 100 percent serious about it and i think people understand that i am at least the people at my gym and in my training camp do i think that filters through in the interviews that i do this is my life and its taken a while for me to figure out what i wanted to do with myself everybodys going to have their opinion but as long as i keep my nose to the grindstone everything will work out but more importantly everybody wants to see a winner and i want to win this fight not to prove anything to anybody else but to prove to myself that im capable of being in the octagon
980550 lifestyle wise this has been great for me to be home every night in my own bed and to be near my family as often as i can
980551 thats been huge for me everything in life nowadays is so material so for me to be able to be home and be happy is the number one key for me all the other stuff is really meaningless we enjoy doing what we do and most people who have the right job enjoy going to work but the car im driving the clothes im wearing thats all materialistic stuff and its all fake in the end weve got to answer to one person and look ourselves in the mirror every day

980557 the question is going to be raised are you telling me that this person would be a better qualified vice president than hillary clinton
980558 there are a lot of women apoplectic at the discussion of bob barr and chuck hagel
980559 it seems like the smart choice will be to pick hillary clinton because she adds so much to the ticket but the second choice should be a nominee who supported hillary clinton to try and bring the sides together
980560 those adamant clinton supporters the older and i would say wealthier women and some of the better known feminists from the dark ages i think they will use his vice presidential choice whether a woman or a man as an excuse not to support him
980561 ford lost because the neoconservatives sat on their hands and didnt turn out to vote the real worry is that clintons supporters are going to sit on their hands the older feminists

980587 i can say im a multiple tour winner ive stayed out here a long time ive played the presidents cup ive been in the top 40 in the world rankings for a good part of this year not bad for a hacking bank teller
980588 absolutely not he is the most sincere honest loyal guy ive ever met the fact that hes a really good dude is not portrayed
980589 its ok to be politically correct but its not ok to tell the truth i tell the truth and i get lambasted because youre too hard on yourself im the one who hits the shots im the one who takes responsibility
980590 the problem is that the sewer system was designed for a climate which is different from the one we have got now

980757 the government provides no social security and so the poor have nothing to look forward to but death or crime
980758 in the last two months street crimes and robberies have increased at least by 25 percent
980759 the government doesnt have enough money in its kitty to provide subsidies
980760 where it does manage to subsidize food prices poor control over our borders leads to food items being smuggled into neighboring countries
980761 the checks and balances instituted by the previous government of president pervez musharraf and prime minister shaukat aziz to stem price hikes failed miserably

980771 it is likely that in the northern hemisphere the 1990s was the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year during the past thousand years
980772 when i first saw the graph it reminded me of dot com profit forecasts which were also hockey sticks it was a compelling graphic but in the mineral exploration industry my own field compelling graphics are one of the techniques used to interest investors in financing mineral exploration
980773 from my own experience i thought that the graphic looked excessively promotional
980774 a trick of mining promoters is to overemphasize some isolated results i wondered if this had been the case with the hockey stick as well i thought that it would be interesting to look at the data underlying this graphic as though i was looking at drill core from an exploration project the interest was simply personal i had no intention of writing academic articles and never expected what happened afterward
980775 however he said that he would ask his colleague scott rutherford to locate the data rutherford then said that the information did not exist in any one location but that he would assemble it for me i thought this was bizarre this study had been featured in the main ipcc policy document i assumed that they would have some type of due diligence package for the ipcc on hand as you would have in a major business transaction if there was no such package perhaps there had never been any due diligence on the data as i understood the term in the end this turned out to be the case the ipcc had never bothered to verify mann bradley and hughes study
980776 of the series and sites listed in the original documentation 35 were not actually used to further confuse matters in november 2003 over five years after publication mann stated that they had actually used 159 series instead of the 112 mentioned in his nature article or in rutherfords e mail
980777 this is the first time that ive heard of the number 159 in our analysis of the hockey stick we do not use the actual data but a series of pseudo proxies proxies we take from our simulations we have always assumed 112 pseudo proxies
980778 we did not claim to have discovered a warm medieval period we only stated that given the many defects in the study it could not be used to assert that the 1990s were the warmest years of the past millennium
980779 mann stated that we had used the wrong data and somehow we failed to notice errors in the data this was outrageous as we had downloaded the data from his own ftp site from the location provided by his own colleague scott rutherford we had described countless errors in great detail and had re collated over 300 series to avoid these problems now according to mann we should have taken the data off a different address at his ftp site but this new address had never been mentioned in any publication or even on his own web site
980780 this was when the figure of 159 series first appeared there is no mention of this stepwise method in his nature article a pca calculation fails if there is any missing data
980781 manns own response showed that his temperature reconstruction for the first half of the 15th century depended on data from the north american network we decided to find out everything that we could about these three indicators
980782 the effect is that tree ring series with a hockey stick shape no longer have a mean of zero and end up dominating the first principal data component in effect manns program mines for series with a hockey stick shape
980783 tree rings with a hockey stick shape dominate the pca with this method
980784 if we used manns method on red noise we consistently obtained hockey sticks with an inflection at the start of the 20th century we have repeated the simulation thousands of times and in 99 of the cases the result of the pca was a hockey stick

980789 the condition of at least two three injured labourers was critical
980790 i called you a creeper because you wouldnt just tell me your address
980791 i was confident we would come back we have done that in past one look at the dressing room shows you how much potential and quality this team has overall we played very well in this test match and everybody contributed
980792 this team has been through ups and downs and it has a fair amount of experience and quality there was no doubt that we will regroup and come back hard i am really proud of the way we played this test
980793 the way he scored runs in both innings was great gautams contributions also were vital but veeru getting those 201 runs in a total of 329 is something amazing taking that forward into the second innings is never easy but he batted brilliantly and gave us another strong start
980794 it was an honest performance by a very hard working team under adverse conditions it was very good and i am pleased with it
980795 it was the best performance because the conditions were difficult i was afraid that had it rained for another half hour before the start of the game the match would have been called off
980796 it is very tough to continue with the same vigour if you have dominated the first half i asked them to keep things straight
980797 the weight of the coin would be 8 gram and diameter would be 28 millimetres
980798 the delhi blasts occurred oct 29 and my son took birth on dec 16 i want to see my son

980800 every time i listen to the news of some bomb blasts i feel dejected i relive that saturday when i lost everything my eyes one ear one hand and ability to see my family
980801 my son pradeep kumar is a baby now but when he will grow up he will also feel proud for being the son of a brave father
980802 i have lived that moment and dont want anyone to face the same situation i fail to understand what terrorists get by killing innocent people
980803 i am thankful to authorities but the salary of rs 3 250 is too little to support a family
980804 this is a major step and the next step is to go forward to the nuclear suppliers group nsg and talk to all member countries if we can do that expeditiously we would hope to be able to deliver the package to our congress in september
980805 it is going to be process now and then working with countries who have questioned making sure that their questions get answers

980816 on a fundamental level we want to help innovative startups succeed what aban provides of course is the financial investment what we provide is an infusion of intellectual capital what we can primarily provide is expertise and technology development and software business management such as product and project management we have market access partner ecosystems and of course a very strong brand these are all things we could provide as needed
980817 the other means of assistance include things like taking them through acceleration programs which cover software business management that would include product and project management

980842 we call on all cpp executives and members throughout the country to be vigilant monitor what goes on at the polling stations and ensure that this registration process only registers qualified voters
980843 we should ensure that as they register with the cpp they also register with the electoral commission
980844 i dont see how you can deprive people of the opportunity to register by your own arrangement the arrangement as we understood was meant to be 10 days but if you go on the ground in your electoral area it is for six days in another area it is for four days the public have not been properly informed we are definitely going to vote for an extension

980972 jai pris un bon d part en 1 re manche et je roulais bien avant que je chute apr s a jai eu du mal reprendre ma vitesse et mon rythme surtout quand la piste est devenu plus dure je suis content davoir fini la course 4e parce que je savais que javais donn le meilleur je savais que la seconde manche serait encore plus dure jai pris un autre bon d part et fait le holeshot cette fois je nai pas tait en t te longtemps parce que nagl et devant moi et je savais quil fallait que je le double par chance pour moi il a chut mais 2 virages plus tard jai cal jai mis un moment pour repartir parce que j tais un peu fatigu mais je voulais rester devant et jai pouss pour finir 4e et 4e au g n ral du jour
980973 la piste n tait pas comme je lavais imagin et je ne lai pas trop aim e elle tait tr s rapide avec beaucoup de petits sauts ce qui ne ressemble pas la piste de lommel habituelle je nai pas pris un bon d part en 1 re manche et jai d utiliser beaucoup d nergie pour revenir travers le paquet mais c tait bien apr s d tre en t te de la course ensuite jai fait une faute ou 2 parce que je n tais pas assez concentr donc ils ont pu revenir sur moi mais jai r ussi finir 3e ce qui nest pas mauvais dans la 2nd manche je nai pas fait un extraordinaire d part jai chut dans le 4e ou 5e virage mais jai pu vite repartir ca a t une course difficile donc jai pris mon rythme pour assurer ma place jusqu la fin de la course je voulais reprendre des points sur les leaders du championnat ce que jai fait donc je suis assez content
980974 je suis content de la fa on dont jai roul ce week end m me si je suis tomb plusieurs reprises j tais rapide et je jouais bien avec le circuit sans m puiser de trop maintenant comme tout le monde jai chut en premi re manche je pars neuvi me et je reviens assez vite quatri me derri re le trio de t te sans chercher les attaquer je savais que la fin de course serait difficile je gardais de l nergie pour attaquer en fin de manche mais deux chutes me coutent la victoire le second d part fut moins bon il ma fallu trois tours pour prendre mon rythme et ensuite je suis remont mais deux chutes mont fait perdre du temps les v nements de fin de course mont bien aid pour une fois jai mieux roul en premi re manche quen seconde mais cest en seconde que je fais mon meilleur r sultat en allant doubler ramon dans le dernier tour si on mavait dit en d but dann e que je roulerais aussi bien ici jaurais sign de suite le travail paye et cest encourageant pour lavenir
980975 mon d part na pas t tr s bon dans la 1 re manche mais jai fait un bon premier tour et jai doubler beaucoup de gars mon pilotage tait tr s bon avant que jai un probl me avec la moto et si a n tait pas arriv je pense que jaurai pu rouler avec les hommes de t te car je roulais tr s vite mais a na pas t la cas je suis mieux sortie de la grille lors du 2e d part mais dans le premier tour jai heurt la roue arri re de et jai chut quand jai red marr la moto jai d repartir dernier mais l cart tait trop important et je nai pas pu faire mieux que 13e
980976 jai fait un assez mauvais week end je nai pas r ussi rouler comme je sais que je peux faire ce style de piste est ma sp cialit mais lors de toutes les manches dessais jai chut et encore ce matin au warm up donc mentalement je n tais pas au mieux au premier d part je pars autour de la 20e place et mon pilotage tait meilleur mais pas aussi bon que je laurai souhaite malgr a je termine 10e jai pris un meilleur d part dans la 2e course en partant dans le top 15 mais au 2e virage jai chut avec 6 ou 7 autres pilotes apr s a il a tait difficile de revenir 19e tait le mieux que je pouvais faire

981070 a light rail network will be costly and it will take time however this is a network not just for a few years but for many generations to come it will be the basis upon which edinburgh can grow and flourish it is after all the physical arteries that are the lifeblood of the community better therefore to take our time to get it right than progress at pace and repent at leisure moreover in transport like most other things in life you get what you pay for do it on the cheap and youll get the quality it merits
981071 time is of the essence as the difficulties mount and the traffic flows continue to increase it is not enough to simply bemoan that edinburgh has become a victim of its own economic success action is needed in view of the problems that are arising and the timescale for construction
981072 the vision for edinburgh has to be to aspire to be a truly capital city

981095 while travelers are no doubt feeling pinched especially in light of rising food and gasoline prices it is difficult to blame airlines for raising prices in order to cover costs that are by and large beyond their control

981110 if a whole province such as the episcopal church acts contrary to gods word and the consensus of the communion who in the anglican communion has the authority to discipline that erring province
981111 so when the archbishop of canterbury invited these american bishops to participate in the lambeth conference against the recommendations of the windsor report and the primates meeting and in the face of the unrelenting commitment of the american church to bless sinful behaviour we were stunned
981112 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
981113 st francis of assisi said preach the gospel at all times when necessary use words we believe that our absence at this lambeth conference is the only way that our voice will be heard for more than ten years we have been speaking and have not been heard so maybe our absence will speak louder than our words

981151 we started buying hybrids in 2002 long before gas prices spiked
981152 obviously having hybrid vehicles is a huge part of that
981153 this definitely is a cost savings as far as miles per gallon and as far as the rebate
981154 we feel like that if we demonstrate significant savings that there might be other school systems that will be interested

981228 integrated visibility and control over the movement of inventory and assets across todays complex global supply networks can be slow costly and very challenging in the past inventory and the assets used to ship them were tracked in two separate systems which made closed loop tracking of assets very difficult with the new release customers can manage this combined movement through a single process driving greater efficiency improved visibility and stronger control over supply chain operations
981229 being able to manage inventory and assets in a single system provides inherent efficiencies there are significant costs tied up in reusable assets used in distribution operations it makes sense to track these along with the inventory they transport for a complete view of the supply chain in motion

981393 this document in which we opened our heart to all sacred ministers make it your business to recall it and explain it for the benefit of the clerics for whom you are responsible
981394 how pure should not he be who shares in this sacrifice
981395 if we would only bear in mind dearly beloved brethren the exalted character of the things that the lord god has placed in our hands what unbounded influence would not this have in impelling us to lead lives worthy of ecclesiastics has not the lord placed everything in my hand when he put there his only begotten son coeternal and coequal with himself in my hand he has placed all his treasures his sacraments his graces he has placed there souls than whom nothing can be dearer to him in his love he has preferred them to himself and redeemed them by his blood he has placed heaven in my hand and it is in my power to open and close it to others how then can i be so ungrateful for such condescension and love as to sin against him to offend his honor to pollute this body which is his how can i come to defile this high dignity this life consecrated to his service
981396 the cleric is reminded that one who is the portion of the lord or who has the lord as his portion must show himself to be such a one as possesses the lord and is possessed by him
981397 you must consider repeatedly and with all attention the office which of your own volition you seek to day if you receive this order you cannot afterwards revoke your decision you must remain always in the service of god and with his help observe chastity
981398 if up to now you have been negligent in relation to the church henceforth you must be diligent if hitherto you have been somnolent henceforth you must be vigilant if up to now your life has been unseemly henceforth you must be chaste consider the ministry which is entrusted to you
981399 may they have in abundance the pattern of every virtue authority that is unassuming constancy in chastity the purity of innocence and the observance of spiritual discipline may thy commands shine forth through their conduct and may the people find a saintly model in their exemplary chastity
981400 it is with great fear that one must approach this high dignity and care must be taken that those chosen for it are recommended by heavenly wisdom blameless life and sustained observance of justice let the fragrance of your life be a joy to the church of christ so that by your preaching and example you may build up the house that is the family of god
981401 to maintain that some christian virtues are more suited to one period than to another is to forget the words of the apostle those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son
981402 would that at the present day there were many more who cultivated these virtues as did the saints of former times who by their humility their obedience their abstinence were mighty in work and word to the great benefit not only of religion but also of public and civil life
981403 i consider that it is obvious to everyone that it is impossible to live virtuously without the aid of prayer

981405 meditation purifies the source from which it comes the mind

981412 sublime is the dignity of the priest but great is his fall if he is guilty of sin let us rejoice for the high honor but let us fear for them lest they fall great is the joy that they have scaled the heights but it is insignificant compared with the sorrow of their fall from on high
981413 the restoration of all things in christ which with gods help we have made it our purpose to achieve in the government of the church demands as we have more than once shown proper formation of the clergy testing of vocations examination of the integrity of life of the candidates and prudence lest there be excessive leniency in opening to them the doors of the sanctuary
981414 in our own day by gods grace many institutions have been founded in the catholic world with the object of assisting the faithful in their temporal needs notably banks credit unions rural banks savings banks the clergy should entirely approve and show favor to these various undertakings but it is not right that they should divert clerics from the duties of their state and office involve them in material affairs and leave them exposed to the cares anxieties and dangers which are inseparable from these occupations for this reason our holy father pius x while recommending the clergy not to spare their efforts and advice in the foundation support and development of these institutions forbids absolutely by the present decree that clerics whether secular or regular should assume positions which involve administrative charges and obligations with their consequent dangers for example the function of president director secretary treasurer and similar posts
981415 the clergy of france will understand that in this difficult situation they must make their own the sentiments of the apostles who rejoiced that they were thought worthy to suffer insults for the name of jesus acts 5 41 they will therefore courageously assert the rights and liberty of the church but without giving offense to anyone nay more in their concern for the law of charity to which they are particularly bound as ministers of jesus christ they will meet injustice with justice counter insults by gentleness and answer ill usage by kindness
981416 we ourselves were at one time attached to this institute we have had practical experience of its utility and excellence and have made a point of continuing to share in its benefits even after our elevation to the dignity of the episcopate by offering to all associates a uniform rule of life with monthly meetings and spiritual conferences a regular account of ones personal life to be submitted to superiors and a number of other charitable and beneficial relations the apostolic union secures and strengthens the unity of the clergy and links in spiritual brotherhood priests who are widely separated in these conditions each priest applies himself to the welfare and perfection of all and though the cares of his ministry do not allow him to enjoy the advantages of living in common he does not feel deprived of the benefit of a spiritual family and he does not want either for advice or the assistance of his brethren
981417 the time it takes to ship a horse overseas begins from the time that animal leaves the barn to the time it plants its hoof in the soil of its new home
981418 adding a 5 15 hour van ride on top of the time in flight is not cost effective and causes additional stress on the animals being shipped
981419 a permanent mid atlantic animal import and export center could reduce the cost of shipment for horse owners and buyers and reduce the stress on transported horses thereby increasing the overall condition and productivity of animals shipped overseas

981486 sitting together in the darkness waiting for something to burst
981487 well i can continue from that point we can just do what we do which is just go to the next month
981488 the thing for pete is he does feel sad for himself the first season is a lot of him saying
981489 i just love him because hes real thats a real man and hes in the room right now 20 times over theres a lot of men who martyr themselves and trample a lot of other peoples dreams and they just dont see it
981490 i think shes getting used to it in a sense
981491 i think a lot of things are happening that she didnt think she had in her until she had to sue them i think the second season has a lot to do with her fighting for a place in the office can she be one of the boys in the office ever does she want to be what does it mean to be a woman in that environment she has no one to look up to no predecessor no footsteps to follow in shes the first one
981492 one thing matthew does thats so amazing and were so blessed by is that he writes for us he sees things not only with the character but in your own life not things that happened but he watches what i do and adjusts to that ive read a couple of advertising books from ogilvie and that era i watched some films that i thought i had to see that the character would have seen and listened to some music but that was for the first season mainly its what matt gives you people arent nearly as tuned in to their generation and what their decade is about as they will be thirty years later so going in with some sort of ultimate realization about the 60s is not going to help you play your character
981493 its funny matt and i dont talk a lot about the character
981494 i think pete is a little more kennedy in a weird way i think thats a curveball theyre throwing at you don our protagonist is a self made man who is also a womanizer but the difference with pete is hes actually forward thinking he actually
981495 i think she has a more realistic view of don but now that she has a big secret as well i think she has realized no one is perfect including herself and that helps her look at don with as much respect as she did before just a little differently i think shell always have respect for what he does and how good he is and all thats important to her
981496 i think the arc of his character last season was really interesting he got married and a large part of getting married was
981497 but we dont know what cooper did in his past what sterling did in his past what draper did in his past
981498 really what does pete do different than don they both cheat on their wives theyre both self centered they both have these secrets pete walk away from his legacy he could probably take a seat on the new york stock exchange if he wanted to and he walked away from that to do something his family disowned him for he actually had really big balls and took a really big risk but nobody at the office even knows hes doing that
981499 weiner pulled me into his office this was after the pilot and before we started filming the first season and he said
981500 i would have gained the weight but he said wed do it with padding and my only condition was that it had to look really real and look really good i think we can all kind of identify something in our lives that we completely compartmentalize and dont look at and thats exactly what she does i think its so far from what can happen to her shes 20 she just got a new job things are happening for her and her family youll see in the second season they are not well receptive to what happened to her and i think its buried very very deep
981501 now i am quietly waiting for the catastrophe of my personality to seem beautiful again and interesting and modern
981502 and then they died a heros death and everyone was very moved the end
981503 this behind in here is the lab of dr saunders
981504 there are also spaces up here where amazing things are going on which we will figure out in later episodes
981505 and this is the koi pond but there is no koi so i guess its the pond really we will have digital koi no we cant we couldnt afford that i think i have now described the entire space you can pretty much see from tophers lab it is the one discordant note in this perfect because he is just all the time in motion doing thing playing games fiddling he is kind of a genius and in that way he cant stop playing around but he is also very likeable and delightful and kind of amoral and he looks down on everybody else and he has got red hair and thinks he is really cool but he is kind of a nerd i read about a character like that once so i based him on that
981506 man ive had some really awesome luck but the real luck was when i met joss and when i was seventeen and i came out to la to do buffy and he was really one of the first people that made it ultra exciting for me and it was so wrapped up in a bow you know
981507 that piece of work that you did was special and important because this and it showed you doing that
981508 i try to be my best i like broccoli yes it is like deathless prose
981509 here it comes this is the big miss this is where i fail this is where they tear me down this is the one that they dont like
981510 lets leave this ill tweak some of it which i was going to do anyway and let me write what i refer to as a prequel
981511 okay what is absolutely the most iconic way to introduce this character and this character

981517 my dad told me we dont really know who my mother is so she can be one of many races
981518 i think hes still defining himself and he is primarily cast as heroic which is i think what he is but sooner or later everyone does something to irritate us
981519 its still being dealt with very cautiously and very reverently i think it might stay that way until november but i have a feeling it wont
981520 maybe though its good for america to have somebody running that its not obvious whats super funny about them
981521 about two years ago it became evident that it was harder and harder to do anything about the president on the show you know it just was there was nothing you could be telling the audience that they werent already more than familiar with it was just people didnt want to see it anymore
981522 i think that when this campaign started it was both a breath of fresh air and the country was like totally welcomed it in the sense that there was going to be change i think its been the most certainly of all the ones weve been there for definitely the most exciting campaign and the one that everyones paying attention to
981523 its certainly the most of anything that ive ever lived through so i think thats why we made the decision to go on you know more full in the fall because i think the whole country is watching and thats sort of what we do
981524 my experience with him he had a really good sense of humor so i dont think its going to be a problem
981525 up till now there hasnt been anything juicy about obama that weve sort of taken our foot off the pedal
981526 we at mad men we dont believe in awards artistic or otherwise or anything they stand for and having said that this is the happiest night of our lives i also like to say how glad i am that the message of smoking drinking and whoring that mad men men puts across has registered with the tca
981527 i would like to thank keeping up with the kardashians i would like to thank flavor of love i would like to thank rock of love 1 2 and 3 i would like to thank are you smarter than a fifth grader for pushing the envelope so far that way that there was a place kind of on this 30 rock
981528 thank you guys for making 30 rock the most successful cable show on broadcast television its a great time to be in broadcast television isnt it its exciting its like being in vaudeville in the 60s were thinking of actually changing the name to ratings challenged 30 rock to take some of the power out of it like taking back the n word
981529 we set out with john adams to accomplish really three things number one show a president of the united states and his wife the first lady doing the deed in bed we have
981530 i have to quit smoking cigarettes because i started smoking cigarettes after not smoking cigarettes for 10 years shooting john adams because it was a freakin nut buster nut buster were halfway through the fucking second continental congress and i turned to ben franklin and said dude do you have a smoke i dont care if its a menthol i dont care what you got i need a goddamn smoke nut buster nut buster for everyone and so the award says individual achievement which is very flattering and very gratifying so i thank the tca but it was hardly an individual achievement everybody hauled my large lazy ass through this thing i want to thank the people at hbo tom hanks
981531 i want to thank tom hanks too but for bosom buddies that was appointment television for me
981532 the last thing i would say is it really was worth it sleeping with each and every one of you except for critic alan sepinwall and critic tim goodman they made me do things i just dont wanna talk about
981533 to try to be funny with the smothers brothers tina fey and tom hanks up here its just ridiculous so im not going to try i just want to give the sincere like sappy verison of the speech because its more in my wheelhouse the last year has been a dream not just a dream thats a realization of a wish but a dream filled with experiences and sensations that in everyday life are impossible your contribution to the success of mad men is unquantifiable your words your genuine appreciation that you saw it and liked it and analyzed it and took it seriously i have to thank you and we all do i realize im violating the wisdom of a writer i admire james l brooks from his film broadcast news when william hurt the handsome anchorman asks albert brooks what do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams and albert brooks says keep it to yourself thank you

981535 the flawed character is something that is at the heart of all our shows
981536 this show isnt the most high concept idea but i dont think ive seen anything quite like this this is not case driven this is not the medical emergency of the week its very much about her home life its a different take on a medical show based on an iconic character played by a great actress
981537 its a cool coffee place where a lot of kids hang out
981538 but its not going to be like the old show

981540 in nearly every population of adult surgical patients either medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis reduces venous thromboembolism by approximately 70 if one assumes similar efficacy in pregnant women 5 of the 7 deaths from pulmonary embolism in women undergoing cesarean delivery would have been prevented if a policy of universal use of medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing cesarean had been in place such a policy would reduce the mortality rate attributed causally to cesarean delivery to 0 9 100 000 or approximately 9 us deaths annually eliminating the statistical difference in deaths attributed to cesarean vs vaginal birth
981541 it seems clear that the majority of maternal deaths in the united states are not preventable the most common preventable errors in preeclampsia management leading to maternal death involved inattention to blood pressure control and signs or symptoms of pulmonary edema those involving postpartum hemorrhage deaths were related to inadequate surgical hemostasis in all these cases more prompt attention to clinical signs of hemorrhage and associated hypovolemia would also have prevented death

981623 an army of municipal bin bullies hitting law abiding families with massive fines while professional criminals get the soft touch
981624 it is clear whitehall bureaucrats are instructing town halls to target householders with fines for minor breaches
981625 yet with the slow death of weekly collections and shrinking bins it is increasingly hard for families to dispose of their rubbish responsibly it is fundamentally unfair that householders are now getting hammered with larger fines than shoplifters get for stealing
981626 local authorities wanted flexible fines that they can relate to the severity and frequency of the offence and offender ultimately the fines are there to act as a deterrent

981633 boys get in here sit down and shut up now
981634 oh thats when a guy calls you up and just needs you to come over and have sex with him and then go home
981635 and now because so many young girls have been told that its empowering to pursue boys aggressively theres no longer any need for boys to woo girls or even to commit to a date
981636 the girls are available in every sense of the word and the boys know it

981639 most police divisions struggle to put two cars on the road each shift and those crews can have up to 30 jobs backed up on their call sign when they start duty

981642 we need more police presence where young people are active
981643 these youth gangs should be home in bed police have got to have the power to get them home where they belong
981644 they have the statistics but they dont want them released because they are embarrassing
981645 im concerned by advice from the police commissioner that what were starting to see in relation to youth violence is firstly younger teenagers involved secondly more girls involved in this sort of activity and thirdly a higher likelihood that some sort of weapon particularly knives being involved
981646 these are difficult issues for our police they involve responsibility from our schools from parents and from the community and a law enforcement response

981649 could be discussed in schools in the context of being one of a range of views on evolution
981650 what is not fine is to say there are these two theories one is called evolution the other is called genesis if you are going to say that then you should talk about the nigerian tribe who believe the world was created from the excrement of ants
981651 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
981652 i was shocked by how some put up barriers to understanding
981653 i showed them the evidence and they just said this is what it says in my holy book and so i asked if your holy book says one thing but the evidence says something else you then go with your holy book and they said yes and i said why and they said its the way weve been brought up
981654 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with
981655 the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multi culturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come the government particularly under tony blair thinks it is wonderful to have children brought up with their traditional religions i call it brainwashing
981656 i would like to see evolution taught a lot earlier there should be no problem teaching it to eight year olds
981657 for parents to deprive their children of an educational opportunity because of a traditional bigotry is unfair on the child
981658 it seems as though teachers are terribly frightened of being thought racist
981659 its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic
981660 specially recognised and catered for sic in the context of employment education financial services politics and all other spheres of life
981661 i dont care who does the electing just so long as i do the nominating
981662 equality of opportunity provides in a sense that all start the race of life at the same time equality of outcome attempts to ensure that everyone finishes at the same time
981663 that your government has increased aid to the palestinian authority this was seen as a big deal by the quartet something john howard would not have done and a sign perhaps of a different approach by kevin rudd on israel
981664 thats an even handed approach which labor has had as its policy for a long period of time its a two nation solution thats even handed
981665 contrasts with the previous government which tilted australias middle east policy towards israel and made little pretence of adhering to an even handed approach
981666 it wasnt so long ago jewish labor supporters were arguing there was no difference between liberal and labor policy towards israel and jews who attended private dinners with kevin rudd in toorak and other private homes were led to believe labor would continue to support israel
981667 this letter writer will be watching for the next arab muslim backed un anti israel resolution to see if rudd stands by his commitment to the jewish community
981668 children especially teens become the emotional whipping boys of other residents and if they speak up they risk getting the family thrown out
981669 fund the feminist movements so they exclude young boys because they are the potential enemy
981670 took down her underwear and pants down and inserted her finger into her vagina
981671 ive not survived all that single crap to be treated like this
981672 janie norman may have lived a lifestyle very different to yours
981673 just because she lived in an alice springs town camp surrounded by alcohol abuse and lived a chaotic lifestyle does not mean that her violent death is just another statistic
981674 in the past juries have been somewhat indifferent to violence by aboriginal men against aboriginal women
981675 that did not seem to be the case here i had the sense that overall some kind of value was placed on her life
981676 it is often the case that aboriginal witnesses can be reluctant to be involved but its a credit when they do and its a credit to the prosecutors that they were able to get them to come forward
981677 god chose us in christ before the world began to be holy and blameless in his sight
981678 there will be no mention of condom or safe sex in the revised module on life skill education program but we will be focusing on the aspirations of the youngsters and will also talk about being faithful to ones partner and abstinence there should be no hypocrisy on the subject
981679 the youngsters need to get the right information the children are growing in an unsafe environment
981680 to provide that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
981681 this is a complete about face from the ballot title that was assigned
981682 what proposition 8 would do is eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry which is exactly what the attorney general put in the title of the measure
981683 it will be very difficult for them to win the case
981684 found that girls perform as well as boys on standardized math tests
981685 talking barbie doll who proclaimed that math class is tough
981686 researchers looked at the average of the test scores of all students the performance of the most gifted children and the ability to solve complex math problems they found in every category that girls did as well as boys
981687 gender differences in math performance even among high scorers are insufficient to explain lopsided gender patterns in participation in some science and math fields
981688 girls and boys have roughly the same average scores on state math tests
981689 should take energetic measures to eliminate this phenomenon and ensure that authors of such acts of discrimination on the basis of religion are adequately deterred and sanctioned
981690 attempts to identify islam with terrorism violence and human rights violations
981691 freedom of expression may therefore be subject to certain restrictions necessary for the respect of the rights or reputations of others
981692 it is regrettable that there are false translations and interpretations of the freedom of expression
981693 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
981694 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
981695 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner
981696 proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options
981697 to this day when chinese people think of the olympics they think of me
981698 i am not sure whether i should call it a battle but it does exist as the first gold means so much for the chinese people and also the weight lifters
981699 i realized the change as soon as i came home and was surrounded by supporters leaders and the media there were banquets just for me
981700 when i was a coach of the shooting team i lived just 500 meters from my house but sometimes i went two months without going home my daughter barely saw me
981701 no shes not an athlete most famous athletes dont let their children compete
981702 the chances of success are too small there is only one winner
981703 are you sure because i know you have your own stuff going on
981704 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
981705 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
981706 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
981707 its true that obama doesnt take money directly from oil companies but then no presidential house or senate candidate does they cant corporations have been prohibited from contributing directly to federal candidates since the tillman act became law in 1907
981708 does accept donations from oil company employees and he has two oilmen working as bundlers for the campaign collecting donations
981709 we faulted him earlier for a tv ad in which he claimed i dont take money from oil companies in fact he does accept donations from oil company employees and he has two oilmen working as bundlers for the campaign collecting donations
981710 the corporate tax rate reduction would apply to all corporations
981711 obama is cherry picking here the corporate tax rate reduction would apply to all corporations yes exxon mobil but also to wal mart general motors and home depot to name a few of the other fortune 50 biggies even everybodys favorite starbucks would get the same tax break obamas statement is technically true but singling out oil companies suggests mccain has targeted oil companies for tax breaks he hasnt we rate obamas statement and the claim in the ad barely true
981712 a lower corporate tax rate is essential to keeping good jobs in the united states america was once a low tax business environment but as our trade partners lowered their rates america failed to keep pace we now have the second highest corporate tax rate in the world making america a less attractive place for companies to do business american workers deserve the chance to make fine products here and sell them around the globe
981713 proposed a cut in the corporate tax rate for all u s companies
981714 mccains economic plan includes a proposed cut in the corporate tax rate for all u s companies not just oil companies
981715 sen obamas nod to lowering corporate taxes comes as republicans have been attacking him for proposals that would raise the cost of doing business such as his pledge to raise the tax rate on capital gains and his vow to increase the top income tax rates which are often used by small unincorporated enterprises he didnt say how deeply he would cut the rate but said it could be trimmed in return for reducing corporate tax breaks simplifying the tax system
981716 the conference agreement provides for 14 6 billion in tax breaks and credits between 2005 and 2015 including 2 8 billion for fossil fuel production
981717 this bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country the handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for people of arizona i cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency security and energy independence
981718 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
981719 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
981720 from 1980 to 1988 the wpt may have reduced domestic oil production anywhere from 1 2 to 8 0 320 to 1 269 million barrels dependence on imported oil grew from between 3 and 13
981721 the crude oil windfall profit tax of the 1980s implications for current energy policy
981722 the wpt had the effect of reducing the domestic supply of crude oil below what the supply would have been without the tax this increased the demand for imported oil and made the united states more dependent upon foreign oil as compared with dependence without a wpt
981723 the crude oil windfall profit tax of the 1980s implications for current energy policy
981724 skeptics who want to check the data need to search no further than the eight year 1980s run of the energy industry windfall profit tax during that time domestic oil output fell to its lowest level in two decades
981725 the last time congress imposed a form of the windfall tax was the final gloomy days of jimmy carter and the result was a substantial reduction in domestic oil production about 5 thus raising the price of gas at the pump and a 10 increase in u s reliance on foreign oil a windfall profits tax is the ultimate act of economic masochism because it taxes only domestic production while imports and foreign oil subsidiaries bear almost none of the cost
981726 the track record for punitive measures like the windfall profits tax shows that they usually harm consumers along with the targeted industry in the end the tax hurt consumers more through higher energy prices than it helped them through higher tax revenues which turned out to be far lower than originally predicted because the tax discouraged production
981727 raising taxes on oil companies is no way to reduce gas prices
981728 john breaux you are from the oil patch how do you feel about your candidate talking about a windfall profits tax
981729 well a windfall profits tax is not going to produce a single barrel of oil when we had a windfall profits tax back in the 1980s we produced less energy than before we had the tax a windfall profits tax may make you feel good as a punitive measure against the energy companies but until we get the guys and women who produce the energy working with those that consume it we are never going to solve the problem a windfall profits tax will produce less energy and not more
981730 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
981731 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
981732 the 80 billion in gross revenues generated by the wpt between 1980 and 1988 was significantly less than the 393 billion projected

981748 midori is one of many incubation projects underway at microsoft its simply a matter of being too early in the incubation to talk about it
981749 the real savings are around physical management of the devices and associated licensing
981750 within the microsoft environment we have struggled for years with applications that are written so poorly that they will not work with others
981751 virtualising this gives you a couple of new ways to tackle those traditional problems
981752 on the desktop we are seeing people place great value in being able to abstract the desktop from actual physical hardware
981753 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
981754 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that
981755 i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around

981758 with this kind of computing power future generations will have the ability to collaborate and communicate in ways older people like me cannot even imagine
981759 we need so much processing power there would even be an issue about getting enough electricity to run the computers if they were all at cern the only answer was a new network powerful enough to send the data instantly to research centers in other countries
981760 it will lead to whats known as cloud computing where people keep all their information online and access it from anywhere

981763 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
981764 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
981765 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
981766 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
981767 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
981768 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
981769 the u s may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the u s has long denied
981770 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
981771 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
981772 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
981773 a u s plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the u s facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the u s government has assured us that no u s detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
981774 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
981775 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which u s intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
981776 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the u s and accepted implausible u s assurances at face value
981777 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its u s allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
981778 it is deplorable that previous u s assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of u s activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
981779 responsible for the 9 11 operation from a to z
981780 diego garcia is an obvious place for a secret facility they want somewhere thats difficult to escape from difficult to attack not visible to prying eyes and where a lot of other activity is going on diego garcia is ideal

981783 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified
981784 for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace
981785 now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded

982135 with a significant foray into the office a4 segment just as in other global markets ricoh india also has signalled its clear intent to seize leadership in the indian office automation market
982136 after establishing itself as a market leader in the a3 multi functional printer segment now the company aims to help small workgroups in todays offices to become more productive
982137 we dont go by the general definition of smes in terms of size or turnover what matters to me is how much of the office automation happens even if there is a huge company with a huge turnover but the requirement of printers is not much they dont make a client for us but if there is a comparatively small players but uses office automation products at a comparatively higher level then that is our clients same goes with small business our criterion is the amount of office automation happening at their end
982138 here what is important is that we dont sell just boxes we understand the need of the customer and then offer solutions accordingly it could be a mix of mfds and printers this was we do consulting this enabling customer to get solutions as per its demand
982139 if you want solutions from other players you have to do research at your end on internet or whatever and then ask them to give those boxes to you whereas we do it ourselves we meet the customer and after understanding the need suggest solutions
982140 we also have a clear policy of not selling product on first interaction what we do is to understand the need and then consult so as to offer the best solutions
982141 well i would say we are a bit more expensive as compared to other players but the important aspect is the running cost and this is something which our customers understand well the level of customers satisfaction could be estimated from the fact that 50 per cent of our orders are return orders which means our existing customer give more orders

982221 prep trials are taking place within a changing landscape of hiv prevention research
982222 disappointing results have emerged from recent studies of vaccine and microbicide candidates while male circumcision was found to be partially effective at preventing hiv transmission in some populations and is being rolled out in some african countries
982223 although still unproven human clinical research prep is considered one of the promising clinical interventions against hiv currently in development
982224 by mid 2009 more people will be enrolling in prep studies than in both hiv vaccine and microbicide efficacy trials combined advocates and communities affected by hiv need to understand prep and its implications for the aids advocacy and global health agendas and government and private funders committed to global health must step forward now to ensure that prep research is fully funded
982225 we cannot wait for the study results to begin to prepare for the optimal use and delivery of prep
982226 instead we should look ahead to consider all of the possible outcomes of these trials and make real plans for making prep available to those who can benefit from it as quickly and safely as possible if it is proven effective
982227 this report provides an important overview of prep research and lays out the many difficult issues that are critical for advocates communities and public health experts to understand as trials continue and report results
982228 we cannot shy away from discussing issues such as potential drug resistance the difficulty of adhering to a once a day pill regimen for people who are not sick or the cost of providing prep this report and todays meeting lay the groundwork for these important discussions
982229 we found that people have not reduced their energy expenditure over the same period that obesity rates have increased enormously

982276 new york courts have a proud history of interpreting the new york constitution as providing greater protections for individual rights than the federal constitution this case presents an opportunity to continue that tradition by declaring that the new york constitution prohibits the government from seizing private homes simply to turn them over to a developer who covets them for a massive luxury condominium project
982277 we are confident that the court will see this for what it is government officials bending to the will of bruce ratner allowing him to wield the power of eminent domain for his personal financial benefit

982313 we have seen a strong performance across our businesses in the first half despite a more challenging economic backdrop and we remain on track to deliver on our goals this year of good revenue growth meaningful margin improvement and accelerated earnings growth we have made good progress in implementing our plans announced in february to accelerate growth the planned divestment of reed business information is progressing and we are seeing strong buyer interest in the business the agreed 2 1bn 2 7bn acquisition of choicepoint inc in the fast growing risk information and analytics markets is moving through us regulatory review and is expected to complete in the second half our major restructuring programme to deliver 245m 310m of cost savings over the next four years is on track with the initial targeted 15m 19m of savings to be delivered this year whilst the professional markets we serve are not immune to economic cycle effects they are more resilient than most this together with the changes we are making in the business and the growing demand for our online information and workflow solutions with the customer productivity they provide gives us confidence in the outlook
982314 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished
982315 vou analisar outras op es este um problema que n o me preocupa
982316 theres a lot of people participating already in diving and with the olympics coming theres going to be of course a lot of interest in the sport
982317 our numbers for learn to dive usually i wouldnt say double but certainly go up i would say maybe 30 to 40 per cent
982318 the body regions that were most injured were the head and neck along with injuries to the face this accounts for about 60 per cent of all the diving related injuries
982319 and specifically the types of injuries that we saw were lacerations soft tissue injuries were the most common diagnoses followed by strains and sprains and fractures
982320 about 77 per cent were forward facing about 22 per cent were backward
982321 more than 80 per cent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to a metre so thats not very high about 17 per cent were injured at a dive height of greater than one metre
982322 once i slipped off the board i wasnt doing a dive i was just not paying attention and it was very early in the morning i scraped my shin but that was about it
982323 if youre going to a country club pool or a recreational type pool or a backyard pool youre not going to have the same kind of safety that you would have at a training centre that is teaching the sport competitively
982324 because if youre using the correct technique really the incidence of any kind of injury is quite rare
982325 my first advice to them is youre not a trained diver like they are
982326 so first and foremost if youre going to enter the water enter the water feet first thats the safest way to get into any kind of water even if its somewhere youve swam several times
982327 often youve misjudged the depth of the water or you forget that things do change especially in a lake or a river or an open body of water where the bottom will change and where hazards will float through as a result of currents
982328 we encourage people to go out and be healthy and active and hopefully safe while youre doing these activities
982329 one of the things i remembered from when i was about 13 is i watched my first olympics and it was mexico city in 68 and it really had a profound effect on me

982333 a lot of the problems we face as a group are directly related to people having children out of wedlock and excess children that they cant afford
982334 what about the black community insert presidential candidates name here
982335 it is my fault and im so sick of being told its not
982336 dont you believe in true love anymore what happened to blacken your soul woman
982337 first of all let me say that i do believe in true love but i also deeply believe in the complexity variety and downright insanity of love a lucky person loves hundreds of people in their lives all in different ways family love friendship love romantic love all in so many shades and depths i dont think you lose your ability or right to have true love by loving more than one person in part this is true because you never love two people the same way another part is that if youre lucky you learn to love better with practice the bottom line is that you have to choose who you are going to commit the foundation of true love not a lack of other options
982338 smart people took marriage seriously mature people went to college and started careers before they got deeply involved in a relationship

982348 alnylam is committed to scientific and ip leadership across all areas of modern biologys rna revolution including our ongoing efforts in rnai and microrna therapeutics and now rnaa
982349 while theres more to understand in this emerging biology rnaa defines a new application for double stranded rnas that could have the potential to create an entirely new therapeutic platform for alnylam many human diseases are caused by the abnormally low expression of proteins and rnaa could be used to treat these disorders through selective transcriptional gene activation obtaining exclusive access to these key rnaa patents positions alnylam to lead in the translational research of this biology as it advances toward in vivo validation and provides a solid foundation for business execution as weve demonstrated in the past with our rnai and microrna platforms
982350 were excited to be working with alnylam as they have demonstrated a commitment to scientific excellence in their publications and academic collaborations

982359 the ibma has always been alive to its responsibilities as an international organization both as regards the interests of its members who happen to live outside the us and as regards the furtherance of bluegrass music worldwide in the last ten years it has taken a number of initiatives and given a range of support in both these areas the summit demonstrates ibmas continuing and growing commitment and aims to lay the foundation for a new strategy of action in consultation with representatives of the active forces in bluegrass outside the us a subsidiary but important goal is to ensure that the benefits of ibma membership are fully available to all members throughout the world the main goal as announced is to build a consensus for new efforts for the growth of bluegrass music on the international scene in the process we expect to foster closer contacts among international bluegrass business interests and organizations explore opportunities and challenges for our musics success outside the us and set our priorities for the use of available resources to help bluegrass grow worldwide replies and applications to attend the summit are still coming in so its too early to list main players who will be attending its not within the ibmas power to ensure that everyone who should be there will be there but on the basis of replies so far we can expect people with significant roles as bluegrass performers promoters event organisers and communicators and in associations to be present we shall also be getting input from people in those and other roles who may not be able to come to nashville and aside from main players the input of any attender with a commitment to the interests of bluegrass music outside the us is welcome
982360 my personal feeling about this is that the ibma does a great deal simply by existing the very idea of an international bluegrass community as distinct from bluegrass scenes here and there in different countries would be much less substantial if the ibma was not there serving as a focus and a centre of contact i joined the ibma because becoming a member was to me like getting citizenship papers for the bluegrass nation thats basically all i ever wanted from the ibma it does a lot more for people who want more im also in the european bluegrass music association and its safe to say that the ebma would not have come into existence without the example the encouragement and the cordial assistance of the ibma the world of bluegrass served as the meeting place for european members of ibma and that led first to the european bluegrass network then to the european world of bluegrass and then to the ebma itself there is now a european bluegrass community with a conscious existence and its basically the result of this process in my view thats the role that the ibma fills for the world in general
982361 our momentum is strong even in these tough economic conditions we have leadership positions in good markets and an effective growth strategy based on quality content digital innovation and international expansion that strategy makes us confident that 2008 will be another record year and that we will continue to grow

982374 rewarding physicians with gifts and attention for their allegiance to your product and company despite what may be ethically appropriate

982376 physicians who refuse to see reps are detailed by proxy their staff is dined and flattered in hopes that they will act as emissaries for a reps messages
982377 its my job to figure out what a physicians price is for some its dinner at the finest restaurants for others its enough convincing data to let them prescribe confidently and for others its my attention and friendship but at the most basic level everything is for sale and everything is an exchange
982378 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished much more important than the general attempt to link the anthrax to islamic terrorists there was a specific intent indispensably aided by abc news to link the anthrax attacks to iraq and saddam hussein in my view and ive written about this in great detail to no avail the role played by abc news in this episode is the single greatest unresolved media scandal of this decade news of ivins suicide which means presumably that the anthrax attacks originated from ft detrick adds critical new facts and heightens how scandalous abc news conduct continues to be in this matter

982380 fourth any legislation should acknowledge again and explicitly that the nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations
982381 planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 or harbored
982382 fifth congress should establish sensible procedures for habeas challenges going forward in order to eliminate the risk of duplicative efforts and inconsistent rulings congress should ensure that one district court takes exclusive jurisdiction over these habeas cases and should direct that common legal issues be decided by one judge in a coordinated fashion
982383 common legal issues should be decided by one judge in a coordinated fashion
982384 such rules should not provide greater protection than we would provide to american citizens held as enemy combatants in this conflict and they must ensure that court proceedings are not permitted to interfere with the mission of our armed forces our soldiers fighting the war on terror for example should not be required to leave the front lines to testify as witnesses in habeas hearings affidavits prepared after battlefield activities have ceased should be enough
982385 now the fact is that all of these people every single one of them are aliens captured abroad in essentially battlefield conditions
982386 the documents relied on against the detainee repeatedly describe those activities and relationships as having reportedly occurred as being said to or reported to have happened and as things that may be true or are suspected of having taken place but in virtually every instance the documents do not say who reported or said or suspected those things nor do they provide any of the underlying reporting upon which the documents bottom line assertions are founded nor any assessment of the reliability of that reporting because of those omissions this court cannot assess the reliability of the assertions in the documents
982387 sixth and finally because of the significant resource constraints on the governments ability to defend the hundreds of habeas cases proceeding in the district courts congress should make clear that the detainees cannot pursue other forms of litigation to challenge their detention one unintended consequence of the supreme courts decision in boumediene is that detainees now have two separate and redundant procedures to challenge their detention one under the detainee treatment act and the other under the constitution

982410 most of those traveling to beijing this week for the olympics have likely heard of falun gong and the communist party s brutal campaign to crush it

982455 do not call anything impure that god has made clean
982456 you are well aware that it is against our laws for a jew to associate with a gentile or visit him
982457 i now realize how true it is that god does not show favoritism but accepts men from every nation meaning every ethnic or religious group who fear him and do what is right
982458 can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water they have received the holy spirit just as we the jewish christians have

982460 you went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them
982461 do not call anything impure that god has made clean
982462 as i began to speak the holy spirit came on them as he had come on us the jewish christians at the beginning the day of pentecost then i remembered what the lord had said in acts 1 john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit so if god gave them the same gift as he gave us who was i to think that i could oppose god
982463 so then god has given even the gentiles repentance into life

982470 so long as we refuse to include significant remedies to non school problems in our efforts to improve urban education and to close the achievement gap we should examine school contribution in addition to student performance as a legitimate criterion for policy outcomes
982471 when children consume a high fat high sugar meal their bodies will crash and they will be come very tired and lethargic which is not going to help them perform at their best level in school
982472 when you are grocery shopping keep in mind that if a snack is in the home your children will likely eat it so keep healthy food in the house at all times to ensure that they will always have healthy snack options if you keep candy bars and fruit in the home most children would pick the candy bar so just keep it out of the house
982473 a smart dinner will help your childs brain function if they are satisfied after dinnertime then they will sleep through the night and a child needs at least eight to nine hours of sleep a night in order to function while in school the next day

982485 despite the overwhelming documentation of aspartames safety unfounded allegations that aspartame is associated with a myriad of ailments including multiple sclerosis parkinsons disease alzheimers disease and lupus have continued to be spread via the internet and the media by a few individuals who have no documented scientific or medical expertise recently several governments and expert scientific committees including the scientific committee on food of the european commission the united kingdoms food standards agency the french food safety agency and health canada carefully evaluated the internet allegations and found them to be false reconfirming the safety of aspartame
982486 this response will demonstrate that 1 members of the european commission scientific committee on food have ethical and financial conflicts of interest with the food industry that should have disqualified them from participation on the committee 2 members of the scientific committee on food did not read some or most of the research papers they cited 3 the report ignored independent research related to aspartame and instead relied heavily on and frequently cited articles in books and reviews put together by employees or consultants of the aspartame manufacturers monsanto and ajinomoto 4 persons ingesting aspartame are being exposed to significant amounts of formaldehyde that has been shown by independent research to accumulate throughout the body 5 aspartame manufacturer sponsored studies are designed in a way as to avoid the possibility of finding adverse effects yet the committee accepted these studies without any question in contrast nearly all independent research on aspartame in humans and animals has found that it can cause problems 6 human studies and clinical reports published in the medical literature linking aspartame use to fibromyalgia seizures panic attacks mania brain cancer migraines headaches vertigo symptoms related to depression memory loss hives irregular heart beats and numerous other symptoms were largely ignored by the committee

982530 they help people deal with disaster related stress by talking with them passing on relevant information and making suggestions and referrals including referrals to mental health professionals if necessary
982531 project recoverys counseling assistance can include helping disaster victims understand their current situation and reactions reducing additional stress assisting victims in reviewing their options promoting coping strategies providing emotional support and encouraging connections with other individuals and agencies who may offer assistance
982532 its not until after the crisis is over that stress may catch up with people and they begin having trouble coping with daily routine activities

982545 with upwards of 70 of americans convinced increased domestic oil production may at least help bring down gasoline prices the congress became a calamity today as ham fisted democrats led by house speaker nancy pelosi squashed debate to cut and run on five week paid vacations at home and even abroad in some cases with all travel and gasoline expenses footed by american taxpayers many of whom might just be staying home themselves this summer as a result of rising fuel prices with a party beholden to extreme environmentalist who have stifled nuclear generation and increases in domestic oil production and refining for decades the democrats are in denial if they think the republicans will not pull out all the stops to place the current gasoline situation squarely in their laps where it belongs meanwhile over in the senate democrats refused to support emergency measures for relief even if gasoline rose to the ridiculous price of 10 a gallon house speaker pelosi has as much as admitted that they fear debate as it will allow republicans to place blame for the energy situation on democrats

982569 diabetes is all about sugar the sugar in our bodies known as blood sugar or blood glucose every cell in our bodies must have a constant source of glucose in order to fuel metabolism our cells use glucose to power processes such as growth and repair when we eat a meal the digestive system converts much of our food into glucose which is released into the bloodstream the hormone insulin which is secreted by the pancreas gland moves glucose from the blood and funnels it into the cells so it can be used as fuel if the cells are unable to get adequate amounts of glucose they can literally starve to death as they do tissues and organs begin to degenerate this is what happens in diabetes

982572 these findings show that adverse effects are not just seen in children with extreme hyperactivity such as adhd but can also be seen in the general population and across the range of severities of hyperactivity
982573 this is a well designed and potentially very important study
982574 it supports what dieticians have known for a long time that feeding children on diets largely consisting of heavily processed foods which may also be high in fat salt or sugar is not optimal for health

982613 women diagnosed with breast cancer face an uphill emotional battle
982614 at a time when they are forced to deal with their own vulnerabilities women with breast cancer must also navigate the vulnerabilities of loved ones as they react to the news
982615 women who limit their emotions in discussing their breast cancer diagnosis often limit the possibilities for support they can receive
982616 involving and including others in an illness increases intimacy among friends and family and opens the door to additional support
982617 impacts on individual species indicate wider changes at the biome level that will potentially change conditions for many plant and animal species in addition to ecosystem services to humans
982618 the central u s is characterized by an ecotone thats the intersection of forest in the east and grassland in the west
982619 the border between these ecosystems is largely determined by climate variability and it is likely that climate change will shift the location of this and other ecological boundaries worldwide
982620 lynx is one species that is vulnerable but the potential impacts of climate change on entire ecosystems are even more alarming

982623 we already know that approximately 25 of men and 9 of women in the middle age bracket in australia stop breathing during sleep at least five times per hour
982624 however because sleep apnea is strongly associated with obesity and its related diseases it has been difficult in the past to produce clear evidence that increased mortality is a result of osa and not because of other established causes
982625 that evidence is now available and shows that moderate to severe sleep apnea is associated with about five times the risk of dying after you control for other factors that are already known to cause premature death
982626 there is a need for high quality clinical trials looking at treatments for sleep apnea that are large enough and long enough to find out whether we can prevent disease or reduce mortality risk
982627 obstructive sleep apnea is a deadly disease and it is now time for public health and medical practitioners as well as the general public to take it seriously
982628 the health profession needs to look closely at ways of detecting sleep apnea in children adolescents and young adults to prevent sleep apnea in the over 40 years age group
982629 sleep apnea prevention is different to obesity prevention as genetic factors related to facial shape and structure also play a role in pathogenesis
982630 for a disease that has been transformed from almost uniformly fatal to manageable over decades the impact of treatment decisions is substantial

982666 no state with the possible exception of texas has taken the agrarian myth to heart more than missouri
982667 no matter how urban they are statewide candidates go to extremes to emphasize their rural roots
982668 the more farming as a self sufficient way of life was abandoned for farming as a business the more merit men found in what was being left behind and the more rapidly the farmers sons moved into the towns the more nostalgic the whole culture became about its rural past its hero was the yeoman farmer its central conception the notion that he is the ideal man and the ideal citizen
982669 the agrarian reality in missouri as opposed to the agrarian myth is that people in rural counties are hurting badly the average income of rural missourians is some 10 000 a year less than that of urban missourians nearly all the indicators of poverty are worse in rural counties than they are in urban counties jobs are difficult to come by jobs with decent benefits harder still in many rural counties the biggest employer is wal mart the question to keep in mind as you go to the polls tuesday to choose among all those boot wearing corn picking politicians is which ones understand reality not myth and who among them can make the biggest difference in the lives of all missourians no matter where they live

982690 ao contr rio do que muitos est o criticando ele tem sido ponto fundamental nas nossas vit rias e na nossa caminhada
982691 o renato ga cho tem nos ajudado com um grande trabalho o fato de o fluminense estar nesta situa o dif cil n o significa que a culpa seja dele temos que dar apoio pois a fase vai passar ele sempre ajudou o grupo e n o podemos deix lo n o h tempestade que dure para sempre
982692 nosso grupo perdeu v rios jogadores e isso tem atrapalhado o rendimento mas quem ficou precisa trabalhar para tentar mudar o quadro n o podemos ficar falando no gabriel c cero ou nos thiagos pois eles n o v o nos ajudar agora
982693 precisamos entrar em campo com muita determina o caso a vit ria aconte a vamos ganhar moral o s o paulo um grande time
982694 dif cil entender s o seis jogos sem vencer e o torcedor tem todo o direito de cobrar pois ele paga o ingresso mas preciso ter calma o nosso grupo tamb m est chateado
982695 estamos tristes mas vamos chegar para treinar com o mesmo prazer de sempre e poder rever os amigos nos momentos bons e ruins a amizade continua a mesma
982696 acredito que todos querem ajudar se fosse um grupo desunido seria complicado na minha opini o quando voltarmos a vencer a boa fase e a confian a voltar o naturalmente
982697 fiquei surpreso com isto o presente foi muito doce farei uma exibi o deste belo presente em minha casa
982698 agora vejo um fernando que bem mais relaxado ele sabe a dificuldade de sua situa o neste ano mas est sabendo lidar com isso

982700 estamos nos mantendo na frente mas os advers rios v m respeitando muito o gr mio cada vez nos estudando mais
982701 n o quero chegar ao ponto de dizer que jogar fora melhor mas em casa a responsabilidade aumenta
982702 sometimes it tells you things you dont want to hear
982703 we were wondering if you were going to own that
982704 well what the f k are you doing in east london
982705 we suck the most be cuz no one likes our pussys
982706 the question is who would be interested in signing those agreements

982708 the lost ogle satisfies our federally mandated rda for city buzz local celebrity gossip and female newscaster bikini photography
982709 the times ive been on it some of their stuff has been pretty cute
982710 despite questions about their origin the lost ogle serves up the wittiest most inventive and cutting edge commentary about the sooner state available today
982711 i get a little nervous every time i go to it
982712 the lost ogle is a wonderful place to spend time while in the midst of a 3 hour conference call second only to perhaps the okfuskee county jail
982713 its like history on crack or meth more likely thanks guys
982714 concerning the role of the keeper i think that at milan there are no problems i have never seen three goalkeepers of this quality in one squad
982715 today was good not because he scored four goals but because he played more free and with more quality than in other games anelka today and in the last game played more inside the penalty area than before that is where i asked him to play and where i need him not right and left as before he was playing against a big club and to get four goals against milan for his confidence it is fantastic
982716 hey its a little high it must also be kept in mind that the large traders are basically the commodity funds
982717 if i buy according to the conventional wisdom and prove wrong they wont fire me but if i violate the conventional wisdom and prove wrong i go to the chopping block
982718 well you can get a knock off for 100 bucks
982719 we are pleased to begin this new agreement in pursuit of several new security efforts working closely with this major customer their name has been withheld due to competitive and security reasons we believe that our sensor data fusion and shine inference engine technologies along with the customers extensive domain expertise in security and other applications will provide several opportunities to provide solutions to current and upcoming national security programs as well as other prognostic and diagnostic applications
982720 we turned to virtualization because our data center faces a constant need to add more servers while also being limited by the physical space available without expensive expansion
982721 while it took us one year to get our high availability site up and running sungard came in and had our virtual recovery site ready to go in three weeks for our mission critical applications this experience demonstrates the value companies looking at virtualized recovery solutions can gain by tapping sungards expertise rather than handling internally
982722 server virtualization will dramatically change the it recovery services model for both the services provider and the customer with replication to a shared storage infrastructure and a virtualized server infrastructure customers can enjoy improved recovery time and recovery point objectives without the cost of dedicated and custom recovery solutions from the dr service provider
982723 the achilles heel of most virtualized it environments is that they rely on a single data center to facilitate system failover should an event occur
982724 a recovery strategy with no off site data may mean quite possibly no recovery virtual server replication services provides organizations an affordable way to have access to a secondary data center for protection of physical and virtual it environments
982725 for the past five years we have used the postilion retail solution to process card payments from our in store points of sale tills so we were confident that postilion could handle the gift card program
982726 gift cards are proving increasingly popular with consumers in the uk and the project with marks amp spencer serves to highlight this
982727 we see a growing awareness in the retail community of the benefits of running a gift card program in house not only does this provide the retailer with greater control and flexibility but as volumes of gift card sales increase the cost advantage of running these programs in house becomes obvious managing gift cards internally with the postilion card issuer solution makes sense from both an economic and a business perspective for organizations where gift cards make up a strategic part of their customer offering

982734 estive s portas do inferno e agora estou s portas do c u
982735 resolvi escrever o livro para que outras pessoas possam tamb m ter conhecimento desta minha experi ncia para poder ajudar outros que passem pelo mesmo g nero de sofrimento e para mostrar as gra as que nos est o reservadas se buscarmos a deus com vontade f e confian a
982736 a doen a despoletou o crescimento em mim da semente plantada por deus
982737 tratava se de um sentimento interior mas que eu consciente conseguia visualizar na minha mente era como se sa sse fora do mundo contemplasse o universo e me deparasse com a morte de todos os seres humanos inclusive a minha era algo terr vel que me levava para a rua em p nico e com vontade de gritar mas depois olhando para o c u e fazendo o sinal da cruz parece que serenava
982738 pensei que ia morrer naquele dia acho que deus deu me a provar um bocadinho do sofrimento que existe no inferno
982739 ao sair do hospital diante da igreja de s o jo o de latr o veio me um pensamento muito forte vou colocar me totalmente nas m os de deus quando tomei esta decis o inicia se a minha cura divina
982740 comecei a fazer medita o silenciosa e a pedir o esp rito santo
982741 descobri que precisava esvaziar me de tudo para encher me de deus apesar de ir j missa de rezar o ter o e de fazer ora o ao sant ssimo sacramento consegui curar me atrav s da ora o contemplativa do sil ncio e o esvaziamento de mim mesmo
982742 um dia dentro do autocarro ouvi uma voz que me disse durante 30 segundos vem e segue me a partir daquele momento mudei radicalmente de objectivos de vida a partir dali queria seguir cristo a tempo inteiro
982743 para mim foi novamente a voz de deus queria fazer o que fazia ali mas junto das pessoas que eu amava a minha fam lia e os meus amigos
982744 a viagem que me custou mais a n vel psicol gico foi de lisboa para albufeira pela ansiedade do regresso e do reencontro
982745 deus queria me no mundo n o vestido da maneira que me vestia quando estava com os frades da sic lia mas antes de modo normal testemunhando da mesma maneira a minha f em cristo como s o paulo ou charles de foucauld no fundo quero estar com as pessoas e testemunhar a minha f com a minha vida seguindo o exemplo de cristo
982746 uma receptividade boa por parte de algumas pessoas e m por parte de outras
982747 tive muita dificuldade com os amigos para que entendessem o que passei mas acabaram por respeitar
982748 d jos policarpo disse me para continuar e que se algum dia o meu trabalho produzir frutos a igreja far o devido reconhecimento

982755 developers around the world are using aols open services and apis to add value to their own applications and products
982756 were thrilled that so many top notch developers have found creative and innovative ways to utilize the truveo api during this topcoder challenge and are impressed by the breadth and depth of the applications that have emerged from the competition
982757 from simply incorporating video search results into a website to advanced and complex new video search applications weve been impressed by how well topcoder developers have chosen to implement the truveo api
982758 we expect that these new applications and developers will help continue to spread the word and were delighted to see such an outpouring of creativity from this contest congratulations to all the winners
982759 by harnessing the collective talent and creativity of the worlds top developers and putting the cutting edge technology and rich content of truveo at their disposal the topcoder members over delivered with such a surplus of great new applications that we never could have selected the best without the help of the peer review process
982760 were excited to watch how the new apps are adopted and used across the web and social networks as well in effect letting the general public continue the judging process in their own use
982761 he left the muslim church and converted then when his preacher said something he didnt like he left that church our preacher has said plenty of things we didnt agree with and we never left the church

982767 i dont like obama not because hes black or muslim being muslim doesnt help his cause
982768 he attends a church that hates america and damns the country
982769 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
982770 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
982771 should we also discuss the last time he was sworn into office he used the koran not the bible this sounds like a great candidate for the presidency of the united states of america
982772 they were ashamed that george bush was from the great state of texas
982773 we are extremely excited about lfas pro for lenders since many common fraud schemes such as chunking flipping and multiple closings would be much more evident to lenders in pre funding
982774 lenders now have a tool that helps them ensure the loans they are about to make are not tainted by fraudulent activity and detect patterns indicative of fraud within their loan pipeline and other contributed lender pipelines
982775 according to the federal bureau of investigation based on existing investigations a staggering 80 percent 1 of all reported mortgage fraud losses are committed by industry insiders
982776 the mortgage industry is going through a dramatic transformation as standards are tightened and processes are changed so must the tools that detect and prevent fraud by incorporating a holistic solution like lfas lenders can ensure that the loans they make have less risk involved which contributes to more predictable revenue in the long run

982779 most worrying development there has been over the past decade
982780 rightly or wrongly i have adopted an approach which is as near to zero tolerance as is consistent with my duty to take into account everything that can be said on behalf of the defendant
982781 frequently the people who are in the dock have no previous convictions at all and are often in paid employment people who are utterly remorseful and for whom behaving in that way was totally out of character
982782 i realised this was escalating into a problem affecting the lives of ordinary people because they were scared by the prospect of what they would witness if they went for a civilised night out
982783 a multitude of small policies and worthy initiatives that are more suited to a sunday afternoon stroll

982795 when you think of a heroin addict you dont think of me

982798 but the user group has changed the old time heroin user was the guy on the street corner now we have kids from the suburbs
982799 the price of oxycontin has doubled in the last year and a half in the milwaukee area people are moving to heroin
982800 had wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
982801 i needed money to play the game every day my parents give me only 100 baht a day which is not enough i am also fed up with them fighting they are civil servants and do not make good money
982802 my mother gave me 500 baht so in the evening i went to the tesco lotus superstore and bought two knives

982825 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite
982826 our helicopters are on standby but chances are slim for a rescue operation today it is likely that the italian will now be rescued tomorrow

982847 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
982848 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown
982849 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up
982850 there is no doubt that ballast water legislation that stems the tide of invasive species entering our waters from ships needs to be passed immediately
982851 disappointed that we have not yet been able to move this bill out of the senate
982852 i think we can make this work and all i care about is the end result
982853 and im here for one reason ive got to protect the health of the people i represent
982854 hussein says he doesnt face mecca when he prays because his god is omnipresent and he can face anywhere to pray
982855 t he extremists were very much enraged by his comments and they killed him
982856 this is what will happen to america if we dont get back to our roots as a nation we must stop electing heathens into positions where they can make or influence laws we are on the slippery slope to extinction and if we dont change our direction and start putting christians into office we will be a doomed society and we will be murdered for following christ like hussein was we have bent over backwards to accommodate every religion in the world except for those who have a personal relationship with jesus christ we have turned our backs on the one thing that made this country great and that is being followers of christ when we stopped doing that we started downhill and we are picking up speed at a scary rate
982857 see tysons changes an american holiday for some camel jockeys request and the devils are killing christians with no questions asked i hope they are willing to accept the eternal consequences
982858 praise god for people like hussein who stood up for his faith i look forward to meeting him in heaven
982859 hussein will get to see jesus face to face hopefully those he evangelized to will continue sharing the gospel message may god bless the wife that hessein left behind
982860 we need to pray for all our brothers and sisters in all the other countries that are being persecuted by people who worships a god that doesnt even exist
982861 this is so sad but very true every day i hear more of this happening but take heart jesus will be back and soon
982862 nowhere does it say where this happened was it in the us elsewhere poor story on that alone
982863 hyphenated iranians are a potential wealth to the country that no lobby can ever achieve but in order to realize their true value tehran must augment its current policy by establishing a positive relationship with this new population to better explain the point we need not look any further than another country in the region that has understood the potential of its expatriates much better egypt the nile is of vital importance to egypt by extension international laws affecting the water rights are of serious concern for that country fortunately for egypt many of the current regulations are largely favorable to that country it is particularly interesting that many influential persons holding strategic decision making positions who can change these laws are of egyptian decent holding the passport of a western country it is well known that the yousef boutros ghali the minister of finance and nephew of the former un secretary general benefited tremendously by his six years working as a denizen of the imf as a result of his personal clout egypts long drawn out negotiations with the fund culminated in a favorable deal that concluded a major debt restructuring program no doubt successful expatriates can play an extremely important role for their home country picture the mood in the u s congress with senators of iranian origin could france have sold the sophisticated technology it did to iraq during the iran iraq war if the french foreign ministry housed influential french iranians clearly iran stands to gain substantially should its expatriate population hold decision making power in foreign lands then the iranian government should be cognizant that the inevitable assimilation and naturalization of its expatriate population is in accordance with the long term interests of iran
982864 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run
982865 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
982866 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
982867 wanted coachmen must be sober industrious and reliable no irish need apply
982868 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
982869 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
982870 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
982871 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
982872 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
982873 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
982874 i am such a committed carnivore it can hardly be exaggerated
982875 i take the view that all food is wonderful to eat
982876 so i dont really see the point in having a hierarchy
982877 the real revelation i think is the intense meatiness of the mushroom sauce
982878 i tend to use cremini mushrooms but any that you can get at the farmers market or that you grow yourself are just about fine
982879 it makes such sense when you think about it but it sounds so odd to start off with
982880 theres something about the colorfulness of vegetables that always makes one feel cheered up
982881 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
982882 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
982883 i went down this road where i never seemed to laugh or cry

982885 she is injured but alive and she is in afghanistan

982887 it has been confirmed by the fbi that aafia siddiqui is alive
982888 she is injured but alive and she is in afghanistan
982889 if shes in us custody they want to know where she is

982891 es que los medios de comunicacion manejaron a las masas en los debates se vio claro que rajoy tenia acorralado a zp pero dieron mas importancia al comentario de la ni a de rajoy que a los datos economicos y los graficos que avisaban de lo que iba a ocurrir
982892 las drogas se pueden criticar pero es innegable que dan placer
982893 this was an action made in britain they were english boys
982894 what fascinated me about watching these boys on the cctv footage at luton was their youth and the fact that they knew they were going to die
982895 i wanted to know what did they think about as they travelled to london did they think about england
982896 the bishop has given his blessing because although we are extremely close and have made a commitment to each other we are not lovers we have satisfied the bishop that we do not have a sexual relationship
982897 the net result of the shutdown and the ruling may be an angrier prisoner population inmates with less chance to express themselves in a positive fashion most believe that inmates forfeited their constitutional rights when they committed their crimes but that is not or at least should not be the case prisoners still possess some level of constitutional rights
982898 this more than erased gains made in other automotive sectors such as suv sales and the export of other auto parts
982899 a large drop in turbojet sales to singapore added to the woes in the transportation sector which in total fell by nearly nine percent for the quarter

982906 o que nos interessa agora o carro queremos saber como o corpo foi transportado para fora da cena do crime
982907 when a public school fails parents ask only for a choice in the education of their children no entrenched bureaucracy or union should deny parents that choice and children that opportunity

982945 uit ervaring weten we dat een chemokuur veel spanningen met zich mee kan brengen
982946 massagetherapie werkt ontspannend wat ervoor kan zorgen dat pati nten hun rustgevende medicatie niet meer nodig hebben of tijdens de chemokuur in slaap vallen we streven er in ons ziekenhuis niet alleen naar om goede medische zorg te verlenen maar ook om deze in zon prettig mogelijke omgeving en op zon prettig mogelijke manier te verlenen daarbij is aandacht voor de pati nt cruciaal deze massagetherapie is daar een uitstekend voorbeeld van
982947 this blog is my say of saying theres a lot more to me than just a sum of all the parts people tend to gossip about i am what i am and through this blog you will in time get to know the real me
982948 today most votes in the senate tend to be along party lines
982949 we believe in partisanship or there wouldnt be two parties
982950 but partisanship has devolved into polarization and that is what is poison
982951 we were throwing fuel on the fire too but that was back when polarization was sort of outside the mainstream of american politics
982952 now its right in the middle of american politics it controls the microphone of american politics
982953 people of good will of whatever party of persuasion can sit down and build a relationship and out of a personal relationship can come a lot of positive things
982954 i wasnt drinking but one of the first people to come to help me was cal and in the process led me to faith he was a vessel for me
982955 bob likes to say he became interested in the things of christ and the word of god because i loved him and cared for him
982956 i was the first one there when he was at the bottom he was suicidal he was an alcoholic all these other things
982957 i reached out to him in love not to convert him to my point of view not to get him to sign up as a republican not to get him to believe what i believe but to introduce him to jesus christ
982958 when i came to faith it became very difficult for me to be pro choice
982959 in fact i have been on pro choice committees most all of my political career
982960 to a lot of people on the left its a fundamental choice issue
982961 the question is how do we keep more children alive
982962 what more could you hope for than that in this climate
982963 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
982964 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
982965 we know so much about the harmful effects of exposure to violent media content but how much exposure children actually get has been largely ignored now were learning more about the large numbers of kids seeing this material and who they are
982966 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
982967 women diagnosed with breast cancer face an uphill emotional battle
982968 at a time when they are forced to deal with their own vulnerabilities women with breast cancer must also navigate the vulnerabilities of loved ones as they react to the news
982969 women who limit their emotions in discussing their breast cancer diagnosis often limit the possibilities for support they can receive
982970 weve learned that apoe genotype does not tell the whole genetic story
982971 other genes may be acting independently of apoe to influence someones risk for developing the disease
982972 over an average of seven and a half years of observation the people who experienced the most significant cognitive decline had a family history of the disease and one or more copies of apoe e4
982973 this decline was greater among those with both risk factors which suggests theres another underlying genetic contribution to the risk of alzheimers disease
982974 for this reason researchers should focus not only on people at risk because of the apoe gene but also those who have a family history of alzheimers disease conversely studying those who survive to late old age without disease is important to discover genes that may offer protection against the disease
982975 these data do not provide sufficient information to address questions of severity and impairment that might explain such complex drug regimens
982976 there are serious behavioral and emotional problems with many foster children and we want to make sure they are medicated appropriately these are our troubled children
982977 in u s youth across the country this increase in psychotropic drug use represents a sea change in the practice of child mental health treatment since 1990 such trends in community treatment deserve further investigation lets learn more about the medications being taken by children the reasons for use who benefits and who doesnt
982978 so we are generalizing our knowledge from adults to children without knowing enough about pharmacokinetics dosing or long term safety in the pediatric population
982979 we would be allowing the mayor of riverside to be enacting regulations that affect the citizens of maryland

982992 being able early on to recognize situations that may become ripe for cost shifting arguments is essential to fortifying a clients litigation posture
982993 it is vitally important to bring a motion for protective relief prior to incurring significant vendor costs
982994 it is often helpful to work with an ediscovery vendor early in litigation as these experts will be able to identify inaccessible sources of esi quickly articulate the reasons why such sources are inaccessible and provide a statement of the estimated costs of production
982995 niet iedereen die met kanker te maken heeft gekregen herkent zich in lance armstrong de wielrenner die in 1997 genezen werd verklaard van uitgezaaide zaadbalkanker en sindsdien meermalen de tour de france wist te winnen
982996 een belangrijk verschil tussen vermoeidheid na kanker en gewone vermoeidheid is dat de ernst van de vermoeidheid in geen enkele verhouding staat tot de verrichte activiteit of inspanning de vermoeidheid lijkt uit het niets op te duiken en overvalt de persoon in kwestie en dan ook nog vaak op de vreemdste momenten van de dag bijvoorbeeld vlak na het opstaan zelfs na een goede nachtrust er kunnen diverse lichamelijke klachten mee gepaard gaan zoals hoofdpijn duizeligheid misselijkheid keelpijn pijn in de ogen het koud hebben klappertanden en rillen jeuken of gloeien van de huid en grieperig en koortsig zijn

983007 the united states word should not be so carelessly broken nor its standing in the international community so needlessly compromised
983008 there is no dispute that if texas executes mr medellin in these circumstances texas would cause the united states irreparably to breach treaty commitments made on behalf of the united states as a whole and thereby compromise u s interests that both this court and the president have described as compelling
983009 im where im at because i made an adolescent choice
983010 this is not about vengeance this is not about a deterrent or about closure its about the punishment
983011 everybody wants me to say closure or vengeance im never going to have closure its just a miracle word thats going to make us feel good but it aint going to happen
983012 the law is clear texas is bound not by the world court but by the u s supreme court which reviewed this matter and determined that this convicted murderers execution shall proceed
983013 kanker wordt meer en meer een chronische aandoening voor de patient brengt dat nogal wat met zich mee niet alleen tijdens de behandeling ook erna heeft kanker een enorme impact op het sociale en maatschappelijke leven door chronische pijn en vermoeidheid kan weer aan het werk gaan bijvoorbeeld moeite kosten en de noodzakelijke steun van behandelaars en werkgevers ontbreekt vaak
983014 pati nten hebben er recht op om mee te praten als het gaat om de kwaliteit van zorg maatschappelijke participatie en het agenderen van wetenschappelijk onderzoek daarnaast wil de nfk met haar lidorganisaties ervoor zorgen dat mensen met kanker de informatie krijgen die hen kan helpen bij het maken van de juiste keuzes voor wat betreft hun ziekte ook willen we de zelfredzaamheid stimuleren onder andere door contact met ervaringsdeskundigen informatievoorziening en cursussen als laatste gaan we onderzoeken of wij hen kunnen laten profiteren van inkoopvoordelen en kortingacties denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan verzorgingsproducten waar mensen met kanker veel aan kunnen hebben
983015 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
983016 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great

983125 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
983126 its a huge honor for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
983127 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
983128 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure that he will be looking to lead from the front
983129 if he takes to captaincy like he took to his batting i dont foresee any problems at all
983130 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
983131 my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth npower test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring that the team are properly prepared and play to their full potential starting on thursday
983132 ill have my own ways and its very exciting its a brand new test and a bright new challenge for me
983133 ive gained a good cricket brain in terms of what i think about the way i play im very gut instinct orientated and i like to do what i feel is right instinctively
983134 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
983135 the aim has always been to start the race everyday i go out and plan to start the race
983136 im getting more and more confident because every day you run more on it and it gets stronger
983137 i feel good i feel happier even to be at this stage
983138 i know from the stuff that ive done that im in good enough shape to be on the start line
983139 i dont know but i guess im probably not in 2 12 shape but i think if you put yourself on the start line youre in with a chance
983140 during the eighth round of negotiations held since 2002 it is almost about all or nothing kelsang gyaltsen told german news magazine
983141 we will present a detailed plan of how we foresee autonomy in tibet if the chinese side reacts positively one could propose specific preliminary steps for example a pilgrimage of the dalai lama to china
983142 such a development could lead to a meeting between his holiness and the chinese president and provide decisive momentum

983149 we are concerned that at a time when tbi is recognized as the signature wound of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan one of the most widely accepted and critical rehabilitative treatments for this injury known as cognitive rehabilitation therapy is excluded by the militarys tricare health insurance program
983150 we urge you to provide official tricare coverage for cognitive rehabilitation as an instrumental therapy in the recovery process of americas wounded warriors
983151 we believe these soldiers should be able to access cognitive rehabilitation services at outside care facilities
983152 the vital role that cognitive rehabilitation plays in facilitating meaningful recovery from brain injury
983153 his remarkable recovery from a severe tbi has been widely cited as a powerful example of the great innovations of our military healthcare system
983154 mr woodruff has repeatedly emphasized that his cognitive rehabilitation therapy was a vital part of his healing process yet the treatment made available to mr woodruff may be denied to u s military personnel who are similarly afflicted
983155 we urge the department of defense to provide official tricare coverage of cognitive rehabilitation therapies so that all returning service personnel can benefit from the best brain injury care this country has to offer
983156 yes but not the ones you think and it would be counterproductive for me to talk about
983157 there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish id said things i wish i hadnt said but i am not a racist ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him personally
983158 im not and i never was mad at senator obama
983159 and you know he hit her hard a couple of times and they hit us a few times a week before she ever responded in kind the only thing i ever got mad about was people in your line of work pretending that she had somehow started the negative stuff its a contact sport
983160 i will be glad to as soon as this election is over in january to have this conversation with you and everybody else i have very strong feelings about it but i live out here in the fact based world

983162 next year you and i and everybody else will be freer and have more space to say what we believe to be the truth
983163 clinton volunteered very little praise of obama beyond describing him as smart and a good politician when asked about him toward the end of the interview
983164 although not a substitute to accreditation from the new zealand qualifications authority the amba accreditation assures the quality of teaching theory and practice offered in our mba programme to a verified international standard
983165 through the process of becoming accredited i believe we now have a better programme for our students and we will continue to strive to enhance it
983166 based on what weve seen happen at both established reserves like leigh and newer ones like kapiti we expect these species to bounce back to a healthy population
983167 not only is this is a unique zone of important biodiversity its right on the doorstep of the capital city its an incredible resource for more than 450 000 people in the greater wellington region many of whom already get so much out of this charismatic and dynamic stretch of coastline
983168 currently we have postgraduate students at victoria working on a ranging number of projects in the area mapping the reserve making baseline surveys to detect future changes assessing the socio economic value of marine reserves the value of stock grown in reserves the rate of genetic flow between local reserves and the seaweeds and sponges that make the area so special

983188 rainer schuettler is declared entitled to participate in the mens single tennis tournament of the olympic games in beijing
983189 the itf is very disappointed with the decision and feels that the precedent set today could ultimately harm the rights of international federations to set qualification criteria and puts the role of the international federation in the olympic games into discussion
983190 while recognizing that the german noc may not understand how professional tennis works there is no excuse for mr schuettler who is prepared to take a place that was earned by his compatriot denis gremelmayr and of next alternate michael berrer the itf wishes him the best of luck even if he was not eligible for beijing
983191 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
983192 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
983193 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
983194 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep
983195 oh helen it looks like somebody had some good sex last night

983198 both jess and lisa have had an incredibly difficult week and without doubt i am talking to them and helping them out where i can from the whole situation with the pictures to lisas break up with dean i cant even imagine how they are coping with it all what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved its just such an upsetting situation there is a real tall poppy situation in australia and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans
983199 they will talk about it in their own time at the moment they are being advised not to say anything because theyre still getting their head around it themselves its all been pretty crazy but if things keep progressing between them they wont have a problem discussing it further down the track

983203 e cos spiega la dottoressa maria rita parsi psicoterapeuta e scrittrice se il periodo di distacco lavorativo breve si rischia di tornare a casa pi stanchi di prima anche perch per abituarci davvero alla vacanza impieghiamo anche pi di tre giorni spesso serve una settimana
983204 e in entrambe i casi i soggetti pi colpiti continua la parsi sono gli ansiosi
983205 altre fonti di stress continua lesperta sono scegliere la destinazione prenotare e preparare la valigia
983206 meglio rimanere a casa continua la parsi perch chi va in ferie deve rilassarsi e staccare la spina inutile partire con preoccupazioni perch la vacanza deve essere libera da pensieri tormentosi cos chi parte per una settimana rischia di stressarsi di pi mentre se rimanesse a casa avrebbe davvero il tempo di godersi il meritato risposo
983207 man of unique destiny whose name will remain in russias history
983208 solzhenitsyns fate as well as the fate of millions of the countrys citizens was befallen by severe trials
983209 he was one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
983210 remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
983211 he wanted to die in the summer and he died in the summer
983212 he wanted to die at home and he died at home in general i should say that alexander isaevich lived a difficult but happy life
983213 the author of works without which the history of the 20th century is unthinkable
983214 alexander solzhenitsyn was a man of immense personal courage and as a writer the one indisputable heir of tolstoy
983215 stalin once said one death is a tragedy a million is a statistic in his books solzhenitsyn managed to reduce the horror of the stalinist regime to a human and palpable level
983216 his books came out of intense human suffering and in my opinion that is one of the reasons why he deserved his nobel prize
983217 all solzhenitsyns great work was instigated by his experience of tyranny personal freedom once he got it didnt give him a lot to write about
983218 that was i suppose because in his way he was a creation of the soviet system that was his subject matter
983219 there is the question of what do you do in a place that is giving you shelter but is not really yours

983227 in sweden the introduction of flexible parental leave helped increase the amount of time fathers spent with their young children and helped the divorce rate fall by 30
983228 sounds good doesnt it well sweden actually has the highest percentage of kids born to non married couples in the eu so you cant actually equate parental leave and the divorce rate in the way gove would like to make us think for more than half of babies anyway

983230 ma voi pregati la fel de mult pentru probele de 200 m 400 m si 800 m liber si voi decide impreuna cu antrenorul pe care sa mizez in mod special fizic ma simt mai bine decat la atena nu simt nicio presiune
983231 when the mind merges with the heart supreme intelligence or pure consciousness is attained
983232 our economy is driven by tourism and use of the shore
983233 i think we would have a hard time getting public support for this concept
983234 we would certainly have some hesitation just based upon tourism and the natural beauty along the coast
983235 we certainly wouldnt want to do anything that would kill the goose that laid the golden egg
983236 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
983237 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
983238 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
983239 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
983240 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
983241 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
983242 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
983243 and we need and i need michael moore in my life
983244 9 11 has made reporters fearful of being called unpatriotic if they asked tough questions
983245 then when we were in the war if you asked tough questions you would be accused of jeopardizing the troops at the same time you had some of the corporate owners breathing down their necks to not rock the boat
983246 its clear that nothing was proved and you just dont send people to die without absolutes its very clear this president wanted to go to war
983247 i would ask him how he could go to war without cause
983248 how could you go to war without provocation of course thats why he doesnt call on me
983249 the press is the last line of defense if we dont ask the questions this president could rule like a dictator all presidents should be sassed who are they we dont have to worship at their shrine theyre public officials we pay them they have to answer to us
983250 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
983251 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
983252 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
983253 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
983254 were down to a total of two crews for three airplanes
983255 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
983256 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
983257 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
983258 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
983259 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm
983260 as a breeding pair the male and female are worth 50 000 pounds
983261 on its own the female might be worth 10 000 pounds
983262 we think whoever stole it might come back and try and take the male or well get a ransom demand for the female
983263 they obviously came prepared as to take a shark you need a net a bag full of water and a polystyrene box i think it must have been someone who had been in the shop before and knew where it was kept
983264 i could look for another female but its difficult as im not sure it would mate with the male
983265 im interested in shark scientific research as ive been involved in conservation issues in the philippines and indonesia where a lot of fisherman use cyanide to kill sharks
983266 we believe this may have been a targeted burglary of a shark that is extremely rare in the uk
983267 the victim is desperate for the fish to be returned and we urge anyone with information about the burglary to contact us
983268 i kind of dreaded going to work this year it seems like the cloud has been lifted we have a coach thats had success in this league and he knows how to treat men like men
983269 and knowing how to give guys freedom and be a disciplinarian at the same time
983270 i certainly appreciate the support that we as a coaching staff have gotten from our veteran players like lawyer keith john abraham and todd mcclure it makes all the difference in the world for younger guys who sometimes dont know what to expect from themselves and their teammates
983271 something which has never occurred since time immemorial a young woman did not fart in her husbands lap
983272 how do you entertain a bored pharaoh you sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the nile and urge the pharaoh to go catch a fish
983273 what hangs at a mans thigh and wants to poke the hole that its often poked before answer a key
983274 jokes have varied over the years with some taking the question and answer format while others are witty proverbs or riddles
983275 what they all share however is a willingness to deal with taboos and a degree of rebellion modern puns essex girl jokes and toilet humor can all be traced back to the very earliest jokes identified in this research

983277 its natural that companies are grabbing the chance to take advantage when the patriotic sentiment is at its peak
983278 but this marketing strategy that appeals only to patriotism could give rise to excessive nationalism
983279 but i think that what we can take from this game is that it was 100 percent better than last game we showed some character and we fought back
983280 there is going to be a relaxing of the dress protocols and people are being encouraged to wear lighter clothing
983281 i dont want to get involved in the fashion police of determining exactly what people can wear but the encouragement of business casual is where we are going
983282 yo can i take it back to where it all started
983283 it was hard for me to perform the first song because when i see 100 000 people singing along theres only one person i could think of whos missing tonight

983285 we are not going to comment on whether there is a criminal investigation
983286 its not the one by the government which is why we put the link on our front page of the landing site and it is a free report its really a test drive for people to understand whats in that report because a report can be very complex
983287 any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
983288 the effect of opening up anwr to drilling on the current price of oil
983289 the recent addition of these pressures and constraints to a broadline retailing industry that already operated on thin profit margins has forced the debtors into inadequate liquidity levels
983290 he cherished our love he helped make me the woman i am today
983291 i understand youve felt emotionally abused but youre not telling me that youve experienced physical abuse as well are you
983292 but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
983293 hmm sorry were a little confused didnt ms simpson bring this all up in the first place feels kinda like her confession is only a half truth either a shes just opening up its not like she owes the world to reveal something personal and thats totally okay or b shes just trying to promote her album
983294 to do something that has a big budget a great scope with a great director and great actors that has the quality and level of writing and the level of production design is a once in a lifetime opportunity
983295 any actor in his right mind would want to do this film would die to do it
983296 i would really come back for the people the thai people seem to be incredibly generous warm kind of loving people so its very nice to be around them the crews are magnificent and everybody ive met in my brief time off has been lovely
983297 i feel like im still a teenager because im perpetually in high school
983298 some companies are just not going to be able to keep up with r amp d costs
983299 if the current situation continues things will only get worse
983300 we will have fewer mobile phone makers fewer handset sales agents and fewer cellphone models i just dont see anything on the horizon that would makes things better
983301 with the market contracting at this pace and with development costs rising how are they going to make money
983302 i feel like im still a teenager because im perpetually in high school
983303 this is peter pan i hope they break up before they grow up
983304 anyway as my band mates and i attempt to finish our most complete and radical album yet
983305 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
983306 if you raise taxes to fund the plan the people who are taxed are poorer and theyll spend less if you borrow money to fund the plan the people who buy the government bonds have less money to spend and that offsets the stimulus its like taking a bucket of water from the deep end of a pool and dumping it into the shallow end funny thing the water in the shallow end doesnt get any deeper whoever gets stimulated is likely to be offset by someone who gets unstimulated
983307 reduced domestic oil production from between 3 and 6 percent and increased oil imports from between 8 and 16 percent

983312 developers shouldnt use the olympics to take our homes and we cannot stop protecting our rights because of the olympics
983313 under the proposed legislation companies could no longer have the right to insist on one secret ballot instead the free choice or card check legislation would let unions form if more than 50 of workers simply sign a card saying they want to join
983314 conservative radio is a huge threat and political advantage for republicans and we have had to find a way to limit it
983315 salem broadcasting co is a big target but the big one is going to be limbaugh we know we cant shut him up but we want to make life a bit more difficult for him
983316 congress has protected its prerogatives and privileges at the expense of oversight
983317 the current system is not based on sound management principles instead it imposes confusing and burdensome priorities and directives to the point that congressional oversight threatens the dhs mission

983320 there is no greater failure in any part of democracy than the incarceration of the wrongfully accused
983321 we all expect this system to work but it doesnt we expect that when a judge finds someone guilty he is but that just isnt the case
983322 if youre rich and guilty youre likely to not go to prison but if youre poor and innocent then your chances of going to prison increase significantly
983323 if you dont want a faulty conviction it would help to not be broke not to be black and to not have an incompetent lawyer
983324 i hope this hug a thug mentality catches on because i have no intention on changing my philosophy any time soon
983325 i am not optimistic about texas correcting its behavior on its own
983326 its going to take federal mandates texas is a national embarrassment and it should be until it cleans up its act
983327 im getting there its been a long process but i know god has his hand on my life
983328 although we are here we are not the only ones
983329 for every innocent person convicted there is a guilty person walking the street committing crime if thats all we want a conviction then this is a poor place to be incarceration might not be so bad
983330 estou contente espero que isto venha resolver as coisas e eliminar parte do crime

983335 since revealing the live date last week there has been much conjecture as to where the london club shows exact location would be many had hoped that it would it be at the astoria or kentish town forum but apparently it will be at londons indigo2 inside the o2 arena
983336 mendoza had a decent start tonight great no decent yes i still think he should go to the bullpen

983339 as everybody might know i have always wanted to move to spain because i have a strong bond with that country now im going to play for real madrid its a dream comes true
983340 a lot of these guys are still learning but overall we just have to be aggressive onb the rubber just like we are at the plate
983341 i think little by little this organization is starting to realize the importance of pitching because statistically theres been a lack of it
983342 i think little by little this organization is starting to realize the importance of pitching
983343 i think little by little this organization is starting to realize the importance of pitching because statistically theres been a lack of it were taking strides and making moves in the right direction we hired nolan ryan
983344 thank god they hired nolan ryan because when it comes to baseball and pitching jon daniels doesnt have a clue as to what hes doing
983345 when it involves the on going pitching problems who should have been fired
983346 ryan i ve heard thought connor was a good pitching coach who had been provided very limited talent to work with
983347 it s a contradiction for this team to be taking its wild card chances seriously and then sit on butts when it came time to deal
983348 and then in a strange ending to the week mark connor was fired friday tell me again exactly what good pitchers he traded
983349 we have not still been able to catch him fazul but we are on his trail

983356 it is chaos but we are managing and having a wonderful time
983357 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
983358 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down
983359 its more technical its steeper the weather is more intense
983360 i am disappointed and it was a surprise because this is a player who has played in the champions league and been in the argentina squad for the olympic games you have managers talking about how good he is so i think the system needs to change
983361 we have maybe eight or 10 teams in spain italy and greece asking about him when you have eight or 10 teams asking about a player and hes not playing it means that he is good but maybe there is another vision of football
983362 hopefully in the future if hes playing in the champions league maybe someone will say oh we made a mistake at the end of the day we are talking about the future of a player and i dont think that is fair
983363 there is no way really to talk about what a cowboy does and who a cowboy is without first talking about beef
983364 all the cowboys robb has photographed for this collection work on grass fed operations running herds in what robb considers more faithful to the traditional way of cattle rearing this is a conscious decision on his part and is not meant to imply a prejudice against the industrialized feedlots which still require working cowboys on horseback to patrol the pens but more a commitment just like the antiquated equipment and method he has used to make the images to an older less artificially enhanced way of working living and putting life in focus
983365 its really neat in the mornin after its rained at night and you get up and you smell the sagebrush everythings fresh and clear and the suns peakin through the clouds and you get on horseback and go somewhere
983366 that horse was jumpin really high and dad was gruntin and groanin up there and i knew right then that you know that was darn sure a mans job
983367 as you go in defense of our dear native land son be brave but show mercy whenever you can our hearts will be with you till you return again
983368 i am disappointed and it was a surprise because this is a player who has played in the champions league and been in the argentina squad for the olympic games you have managers talking about how good he is so i think the system needs to change

983370 hopefully in the future if hes playing in the champions league maybe someone will say oh we made a mistake at the end of the day we are talking about the future of a player and i dont think that is fair
983371 nice to meet you i said nice to meet you
983372 we are only standing here together because my husband who will hear about this later wandered off in the middle of the conversation leaving us to fend for ourselves i realize that these initial efforts at chit chat have exposed the fact that we have absolutely nothing in common and that you wanted to talk to my husband and not me anyway i want you to know that i am ok with that ah i see that the dj just put on young mcs bust a move and even seems to have turned up the volume for the occasion why dont we just sit here quietly and enjoy the ambiance together
983373 it is sooo good to see you i remember you so well from high school you were as humble as you were brilliant ill never forget how much you helped me when i was struggling in name of class they shared together
983374 your hair is so different its not green or blue or purple anymore
983375 is that you jen i didnt recognize you without a disdainful scowl on your face
983376 i remember the last time we talked you were saying how much you hated this town this school this class and you were lamenting the difficulty of being surrounded by such a bunch of conservative religious fools so whats new
983377 if theres a bottom line in this research its that delaying action carries a significant cost
983378 minor adjustments here or there aint going to cut it
983379 will occur once every 30 years or once every 40 years but were still designing as if they occur every 100 years
983380 the climate is more vulnerable than we thought were seeing changes faster than we expected to see them
983381 historically when we looked at the climate change challenge we asked how much it was going to cost to cut carbon emissions totaled the expenses and threw up our hands at the expense so we didnt do anything

983388 i couldnt get halfway across the street the heat was so intense
983389 he said he came out through the front door but i just couldnt see that it was like running through a bonfire
983390 i gather he ran for what he thought was a door squeezed his eyes shut and kept on going
983391 some of them never dreamed they would be standing here doing this and we need to pray for them
983392 the kids went there because joeys mom died to give them support
983393 he walked out and thats the last time i saw my boy
983394 he seemed calm but looked like he was anxious to leave
983395 but when girls were down there he would just stare at them from the bridge
983396 sometimes hed say stuff like i wish i could get a girlfriend
983397 over time many many successful companies have failed to take important risks at critical points and they have paid a price some have merely stumbled and found later redemption but quite a few have not only fallen but disappeared in the 1980s alone 230 companies disappeared from the fortune 500 in fact only 16 of the 100 largest companies that were around in the early 1900s are still with us
983398 in business you can make a good argument for mistakes like steve job s lisa or power maccube because the highly creative apple environment that spawned them also produced big winners like ipod and iphone
983399 as peter drucker pointed out nearly fifty years agao it is managements major task to prudently risk a companys present assets in order to ensure its future existence in fact if a company never has a failure i submit that their management is probably not discontented enough to justify their salaries

983401 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
983402 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail

983405 the vehicles on our top 10 coolest new cars under 18 000 list are very fun to drive and feature filled first time buyers and frugal down sizers have never had it so good
983406 manufacturers are finding ways to nicely equip their entry level vehicles while still keeping the price reasonably low and consumers are reaping the benefits more and more each year
983407 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
983408 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
983409 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
983410 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane

983412 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
983413 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
983414 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
983415 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm

983417 there are two routes leading to the temple and the barricades put up to streamline human traffic broke down and in the melee everything went haywire
983418 it was raining very heavily and the crowds had swelled immensely and as soon as the rain stopped people tried to rush ahead
983419 there was a man with his child and he was shaking the child to see if he was alive and all the time tears were flowing down his cheeks
983420 no one from the police or administration was helping and it was just people helping each other in the pouring rain
983421 there was total chaos everywhere and i saw dead bodies everywhere and blood soaked survivors crying for help
983422 i am so shocked that i am trembling in my house and terrified to step out and go to work

983426 we ask cambodia to move their soldiers who are near the ta muen thom temple
983427 they did not allow our troops to go thats why the problem happened

983434 current u s strategy against the terrorist group al qaida has not been successful in significantly undermining the groups capabilities according to a new rand corporation
983435 al qaida has been involved in more terrorist attacks since sept 11 2001 than it was during its prior history and the groups attacks since then have spanned an increasingly broader range of targets in europe asia the middle east and africa according to researchers
983436 in looking at how other terrorist groups have ended the rand study found that most terrorist groups end either because they join the political process or because local police and intelligence efforts arrest or kill key members police and intelligence agencies rather than the military should be the tip of the spear against al qaida in most of the world and the united states should abandon the use of the phrase war on terrorism researchers concluded
983437 the term we use to describe our strategy toward terrorists is important because it affects what kinds of forces you use
983438 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
983439 all terrorist groups eventually end but how do they end the evidence since 1968 indicates that most groups have ended because 1 they joined the political process 43 percent or 2 local police and intelligence agencies arrested or killed key members 40 percent military force has rarely been the primary reason for the end of terrorist groups and few groups within this time frame have achieved victory this has significant implications for dealing with al qaida and suggests fundamentally rethinking post 9 11 u s counterterrorism strategy the authors conclude that policing and intelligence rather than military force should form the backbone of u s efforts against al qaida and u s policymakers should end the use of the phrase war on terrorism since there is no battlefield solution to defeating al qaida
983440 baghdad a growing number of senior american military officers in iraq have concluded that there is no long term military solution to an insurgency that has killed thousands of iraqis and more than 1 700 u s military personnel during the past two years
983441 i think the more accurate way to approach this right now is to concede that this insurgency is not going to be settled the terrorists and the terrorism in iraq is not going to be settled through military options or military operations

983475 for over the last 200 years youve seen big companies grow off the concept of real time updates
983476 if you look at media companies like thomson reuters or bloomberg or the stock exchange people and businesses are dependent on real time news coming in as it happens twitter is similar except its much broader than just one kind of news like stock updates so when you think of it that broadly as a utility i think you can begin to imagine how big the potential is for twitter as a commercial entity
983477 how would they respond to us putting ads on the site
983478 there is a level of intent that someone is showing when they come to a twitter search and type in say iphone
983479 these folks are influencers and they want to talk about the hottest or latest stuff going on

983495 perhaps in googles world privacy does not exist but in the real world individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like google
983496 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist in any event plaintiffs live far from the desert and are far from hermits
983497 when plaintiffs discovered these images rather than using the simple removal option google affords they sued google for invasion of privacy trespass negligence and conversion
983498 the response quotes and expands upon an existing legal opinion to help frame the response it should not be interpreted as a blanket statement on our views towards privacy google respects an individuals right to privacy we have privacy protections built into all of our products

983500 and of course it is not all just about the food much as we all love the cuisine from that part of the world there will be craft stalls and performances of all kinds from elaborate indonesian shadow puppetry to philippine and vietnamese martial arts and thai kick boxing
983501 our police immediately intervened to prevent this and are dealing with it in accordance with the law
983502 when you go to google youll end up with a lot of search results and you need to sieve through them
983503 itll be good to have something that gets you what you need
983504 there are a lot of resources out there but there has to be quality control
983505 what were trying to do is take the burden away from the schools so they can focus on teaching and learning
983506 the idea is to build an edumall which is evaluated by its users so that good resources will be highlighted
983507 resources that arent so useful will sink to the bottom of the pile and can be removed as necessary
983508 as edumall grows its going to be very big and this is how people like to work online they want things to be personalised they want to talk to other people to have a home online and the personal space provides that
983509 independent learning for instance students dont always have to go through the teacher

983514 but i dont think its completely dead i believe will come back around next year and try again
983515 this show will be radically different from any other production of
983516 where are you coming from dears oh across town well i came all the way from australia and still made it here on time
983517 a s performed by mr bowen mr bell and susan blackwell and heidi blickenstaff the talented girlfriends they rope into their makeshift make it up as we go along opus it is genial unpretentious and far funnier than many of the more expensively manufactured musicals that make it to broadway these days consider title of show the class clown of broadway but like all class clowns it wins you over by making fun of the big shots and bursting with its own distinctive personality
983518 a sweet raunchy and just about irresistible portrait of how and why we tell stories
983519 but mr bells book and mr bowens lyrics along with michael berresses empathic but relatively inconspicuous direction have worked hard to make the writers in a room dialogue palatable to everyone best of all the totemic significance of maybe just maybe making it to broadway gives audiences the feeling of being present at not just a very funny musical comedy but at the triumphant end of a fraught and fulfilling road
983520 a clever and often adorable little invention about writing a musical
983521 everyone in michael berresses production is quick and charming how i wish i could love the show i wish i didnt feel that i was being manipulated by long struggling talented people on a guilt trip most of all considering the risk i wish the offbeat and low budget show belonged on broadway not incidentally at the same ticket price as the magnificent and massive
983522 much of its offbeat appeal not that theres anything wrong with fluff has evaporated in the move uptown
983523 title of show stands pathetically naked on broadway s tripped of satirical edge for its heavy broadway date the backstage show by hunter bell book and jeff bowen score is revealed in all its narcissism flaunting its shallow aesthetic values and taking unseemly pride in its inflated ambitions o n a fresh viewing the substance of the musical emerges with far greater clarity and loses whatever charm sustained it downtown
983524 originality isnt what it used to be take title of show a broadway musical 95 minutes long top ticket price 111 50 about people writing about people writing a broadway musical these people who doubtless love people must be the luckiest people in the world let me set the scene for you well actually theres not much of a scene to set this is minimalism shoved down to the vanishing point t he self conscious and terminally cute and the pixie like fey are all mixed up with self congratulatory smugness
983525 proving that if you have a feel for the lowest common denominator you can scale unmerited heights
983526 hunter bell and jeff bowen who upon dubious credentials fancy themselves book and song writers decide to write a musical about two self proclaimed gay men trying to write a musical they enlist the help of all our friends two actually the equally unappealing susan blackwell and heidi blickenstaff everyone here uses real names on stage together they proceed to the parturition of 90 minutes worth of unremitting torture for anyone with a shred of good taste discernment and normal eardrums

983544 i was impressed by that simple statement of mrs cannons which carries such deep spiritual meaning for all of us whose side are we on when the prophet speaks the debate is over
983545 always keep your eye on the president of the church and if he ever tells you to do anything even if it is wrong and you do it the lord will bless you for it
983546 but you dont need to worry the lord will never let his mouthpiece lead the people astray
983547 any latter day saint who denounces or opposes whether actively or otherwise any plan or doctrine advocated by the prophets seers and revelators of the church is cultivating the spirit of apostasy it should be remembered that lucifer has a very cunning way of convincing unsuspecting souls that the general authorities of the church are as likely to be wrong as they are to be right this sort of game is satans favorite pastime and he has practiced it on believing souls since adam he wins a great victory when he can get members of the church to speak against their leaders and to do their own thinking when our leaders speak the thinking has been done when they propose a plan it is gods plan when they point the way there is no other which is safe when they give direction it should mark the end of controversy
983548 active mormons know that when the prophet speaks the debate is over

983554 i saw the devastation of the floods in the city of franklin and thought of the magnitude of people who needed help the problem was those municipal offices who would help the residents were also affected
983555 our goal was to provide resources the municipalities to get them up and running so they could provide the relief to the citizens of franklin
983556 we were thrilled to be approached by ihcf to assist them in matching their furniture donation with a flood damaged business
983557 its a privilege to work together as a community to continue doing the most good to meet the needs of our neighbors

983563 also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
983564 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
983565 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next

983629 with its actions in my opinion the newspaper broke several clauses of the 1967 preservation of holy sites law and violated rights based on basic law respect for man and his freedom
983630 the boycott will be lifted only once the paper publishes a public announcement in english and in hebrew apologizing for its lack of sensitivity for infringing on senator obamas privacy and honor for hurting the feelings of any israeli citizen insulted by the publication and for profaning the sanctity of the western wall
983631 barack obamas note was approved for publication in the international media even before he put in the kotel a short time after he wrote it at the king david hotel in jerusalem in any case since obama is not a jew publishing the note does not constitute an infringement on his right to privacy
983632 notes placed in the wall are removed twice a year on the eve of the jewish new year and pessah and placed in a special repository for religious items under supervision to keep them hidden from human eyes
983633 notes which are placed in the western wall are between the person and his maker heaven forbid that one should read them or use them in any way the custom of placing notes between the stones of the western wall is ancient and is used as a means of expression by a person praying to his creator
983634 this sacrilegious action deserves sharp condemnation and represents a desecration of the holy site

983716 we are shocked that a person like arun jaitley would do something like this this is equal to hiding crime
983717 when some people allegedly visited the bjp mps house to deliver money why was it not handed over to police finger printing tests could have led to some evidence
983718 they claim they received a call asking them to come in the morning but why did they go why didnt they get them arrested and call up the lok sabha speaker when the men came to give them the money how come they were able to take rs 10 million inside parliament and put it on the speakers table

983720 notes which are placed in the western wall are between the person and his maker heaven forbid that one should read them or use them in any way
983721 this sacrilegious action deserves sharp condemnation and represents a desecration of the holy site
983722 but according to a statement from maariv yesterday the obama campaign actually leaked the note to reporters before obama even placed it in the wall
983723 barack obamas note was approved for publication in the international media even before he put in the kotel a short time after he wrote it at the king david hotel in jerusalem in any case since obama is not a jew publishing the note does not constitute an infringement on his right to privacy
983724 barack obama may be above politicizing our troops but i guess he isnt above politicizing religion
983725 someone most have fished the actual note out of the wall which is still pretty shameful
983726 all to smear obama as a big phony to the point of nutty conspiracy territory when it comes to religion a smear that is patently false to anyone who has paid attention to obama and his religious views over the years
983727 the obama campaign is denying the note was approved for publication
983728 during the pennsylvania primary obama said that religion was just for bitter people more or less he backtracked on this of course

983866 dfo is supposed to be in fishery management theyre in fishery destruction
983867 for the harpoon industry they should say alright for two or three weeks of the season every year were going to allow these little small boats to go out and go fishing and were going to allow them to catch their quota before the longline quota comes in
983868 but these guys fish five days fisheries tells them the day to go and the day to land so every boat landed at the same time it caused us to have i dont know how many fish on hand that all got dumped into the boston market and it absolutely destroyed the price of what these guys were depending on getting
983869 they dfo probably took a 6 50 pound fish and reduced it to 4 or less
983870 we have an arrangement whereby they can override their quota by 40 per cent which theyve already done now so they are shut down for the rest of the year
983871 so this year they should have started out with 136 tons but because they had overran last year they only got around 88 tons
983872 the problem has been that normally 100 tons was plenty for the harpoon fleet but whats happened as a result of the groundfish fishery not doing so well even the lobster fishery is that more of the harpoon licence holders are participating
983873 normally there would be 20 or 30 of them now its up to 50 or 60 and when youve got only 100 tons to work with that gets picked up pretty quickly
983874 the trouble is what are they going to do out there are they just going to sit out there you cant have them fishing because weve shut them down
983875 were going to have to come up with something else next year this just isnt working
983876 weve made several proposals to dfo to sit down and review the sharing formulas and talk about new quotas
983877 the talks are ongoing and not in an argument sense were trying as managers and gear sectors to work together to get more fish
983878 nobody has any idea how frustrating it is to release 200 fishermen one day bring them back in let them go out again it causes havoc in small communities especially where we stretch from cape st marys to cape north in cape breton
983879 with an abundance of swordfish on the grounds fishermen get frustrated
983880 i think there should be more flexibility between the two sectors the longline and the harpoon and i think the harpooners should have access to new fish
983881 theyve got us in a 90 10 split which was struck back 10 years ago its hard for us to maneuver around it
983882 weve been working with dfo and working with the longline industry too trying to open some new doors and get access to more quota but its very hard

983913 obamas official pronouncements on iraq reflect a denial about the very much changed situation there that would provoke contemptuous jeers or at least tough questions from the press if it were the mccain campaign that was so out of touch
983914 you wouldnt want to put any limitations on his participation in the season because he is only 16 at that age you can improve he looked strong enough and not fazed by the big games the quality is there i dont look too much at his age more at what he is doing on the pitch and right now what he is doing is good

983945 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado

983950 the browser based ui to render the view with the browser not with gtk
983951 the d bus bridge is an essential part of that it lets you easily combine the services from the internet in mashups for example utilizing location information from a gps chip and then combining that with a google apps api and then adding some other services that are providing a binding on the ui layer
983952 it allows them to provide google apps integration but also make mashups that are operator branded and operator integrated they can bring the google service platform to their devices without having to join android they are deciding which services they are providing and not following what google provides
983953 operators can decide to use yahoo apis instead or their own apis
983954 you could use it to integrate a phones media player device with online services so while you are listening to a song the app can call up the online music store to check what similar music is available and make suggestions we believe there are huge opportunities to make very creative new mashups
983955 our main focus is on smartphones and high end feature phones but we have been working with nokia on internet tablets and are now working on mids running on moblin as well

983970 that kind of effective leadership will be contrasted by the media by me by others to the things she failed to do as governor
983971 she raised spending to record levels which i think people have come to expect from liberal democrats
983972 but also she signed our statewide property tax into law and tried to give the state a sales tax which would have really devastated our economy

983976 and to be honest with you i dont think ive heard anybody grumble about them as far as the looks
983977 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
983978 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
983979 as soon as the legal constraints barring disclosure are removed we will make public as much information as possible
983980 we will do that at one time in one place we will do that after those who were injured and the families of those who died are briefed which is only appropriate
983981 i dont believe it will be helpful to respond piecemeal to any judgments made by anyone before they know a fuller set of facts
983982 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
983983 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
983984 higher oil prices and the lack of adequate fiscal policy reactions amidst high pent up price pressures are putting the burden of macro economic adjustment on the monetary authorities
983985 why isnt this the lead story on every news station fox excluded of course
983986 i dont care if your gay or not but you wont have every single right like a female and male couple do
983987 if the fiscal policy response remained inadequate amidst heightened external shocks or resulted in an intensification of domestic inflation then ratings pressure for a change in indias sovereign ratings outlook from stable to negative would increase

983990 your problem is not global warming your problem is that youre nuts
983991 that a reader in the know informs me that michelle obamas thesis
983992 has been temporarily withdrawn until after this years presidential election in november
983993 attempts to retrieve the document through princeton proved unsuccessful with school librarians having been pestered so much for access to the thesis that they have resorted to reading from a script when callers inquire about it
983994 the obama campaign however quickly responded to a request for the thesis by politico
983995 predominantly white universities like princeton are socially and academically designed to cater to the needs of the white students comprising the bulk of their enrollments
983996 activities organized by university groups such as student government rarely if ever take into account the diverse interests which exist at a university that is not 100 white
983997 there is only one major university recognized organization on campus designed specifically for the intellectual interests of black and other third world students
983998 there is a distinctive black culture very different from white culture elements of black culture which make it unique from white culture such as its music its language the struggles and a consciousness shared by its people may be attributed to the injustices and oppressions suffered by this race of people which are not comparable to the experiences of any other race of people through this countrys history not even american indians however with the increasing integration of blacks into the mainstream society many integrated blacks have lost touch with black culture in their attempts to become adjusted and comfortable in their new culture the white culture some of these blacks are no longer able to enjoy the qualities which make black culture so unique or are unable to openly share their culture with other blacks because they have become so far removed from these experiences and in some instances ashamed of them as a result of their integration p54

984008 my detention has left a bitter taste in my mouth
984009 during the four days of my detention at the mashtal prison northwest of gaza city no charges were never brought up against me but i heard from the guys who arrested me that i was suspected of working with israeli television
984010 it became clear during my interrogation that i was accredited with a german tv station here the interrogation took a different approach and my interrogators started asking me about the nature of my work with german tv
984011 its hard being detained in the manner that it occurred
984012 but i want to thank all the journalists and organizations that have pressed this case on my behalf
984013 i am unsure whether i will be able to work freely as a cameraman now without risking detention by hamas

984028 its a new type of war and were trying to get everyone up to speed on what the dangers are how to roll how to keep an eye on each other how to react to certain events
984029 when you look at the mrap and our technology we have things deployed in the field that can defeat just about anything he puts against us but the word of caution is this the enemy is smart
984030 its pretty accurate as far as your need to have your intervals your distance between the vehicles
984031 but its a video game in real convoys you have that sense of adrenaline still its the best we can do without sending lead downrange
984032 probably not every day but close to it but you gotta train and train and train until it becomes second nature

984035 with a tax base like ours we are not being able to on our own keep up with expenses
984036 our ability to be as aggressive as we have been is being compromised
984037 revenue is falling below what we need to maintain infrastructure and it needs to change
984038 the council needs to find additional funding thats about as un rude as i can say it
984039 we need to educate the city council and citizens on what the issue will mean

984043 every human is capable of feeling a whole heap of emotions but so little contemporary music seems to address them
984044 the short tracks are an attempt to show that you can have a short simple piece of music that will communicate itself fully within 38 seconds
984045 on the other tip yes i built up a huge collection of material in the year and half of that was putting the album together so a bit of squeezing was inevitable i hope its not too obvious and no i dont get bored very easily i have the tenacity of a terrier when i sink my teeth into something
984046 there are some vocalists that id like to work with i just hope theyll allow me to use them out of a lyrical content ive been itching to work with laurie anderson for ages as she has a unique way with the spoken word and would prebably be up for some experimentation and i definitely feel i could do something constructive beautiful even with a female soprano something which would exist beyond the level of lyrical content one singer who shall remain nameless threw a temper tantrum and accused me of just using my voice as an instrument thats what it is isnt it
984047 ive really no desire to write cheezy songs which appeal to cheap emotions just for the sake of it call me pretentious or up my own arse if you like but ive set my sights on worthier more lofty goals
984048 a bunch of people blowing a big trumpet and slapping drums is an instrumental band isnt it people have been making sounds without words for millennia its not a new phenomena big respect for the art of noise but their rhythms were a bit rigid for my liking
984049 yes but saying that i also wanted to do my own thing music for adverts is about the shallow superficial existence that we are forced to live its not just saying how great adverts are or please use my music to advertise your product honest
984050 no its more of a sideways look at brians a bit too much of a boff for his own good these days like the saying goes nobody loves a smart arse im not out to pop his balloon perish the thought hes done some very interesting stuff but that all feels like the old brian his spinner album with jah wobble was fun but id like to see him do something more than just be the first to ride algorithmic software composition mozart did that ages ago
984051 the black dog is saying that anyone can obfusticate anything to the point of mysteriousness which made it a perfect choice for the cover he doesnt own the copyright on ordinance survey maps ambience or emotions expressed via synth electronics you know
984052 no i very rarely watch tv but when i do the adverts generally remind me that its time to go and put the kettle on relieve my bladder or get on with my life for two minutes until the programme i actually want to watch is resumed again i try not to hang around and check them out
984053 you see most adverts are attempting to sell you trashy stuff that you dont need alcohol while being dionysian can make you behave like a complete arse and could ruin your kidneys soft drinks are just sugar and water which rot your teeth banks urge you to save for a tomorrow that may never come cars destroy our envirenment while giving their owners the illusion of independence benzine and exhaust fumes cause more cancers than smoking ever will but every advert break has at least one car commercial in it sad isnt it
984054 nah mate they all suck theyre even dodgier than a christian fundamentalist handing out leaflets at least you can cross the road when you see a nutter coming in your front room if youre not wise to the tricks they have you another consumer

984057 i had short imaginary journeys in mind when i was writing some to places that ive actually visited and others that ive only imagined they should be open ended enough to work for anyone the only script was youre on foot alone and carrying a camera which can only transfer your thoughts and impressions into sound press record and see what happens
984058 i love old black and white films especially silent ones if you look closely theres always a black dog in them too you get three points every time you shout black dog and point at the screen inanely the dumb and dumber on the album is me poking fun at a couple of ex friends and nothing to do with the film of the same name which i must confess i havent seen ive also got a soft spot for science fiction movies and computer animated films but who hasnt
984059 no if anything its the william tell overture with attitude
984060 yes i really enjoy remixing its nice to sometimes avoid the manic activity involved with coming up wfth a new track 100 by yourself bj rk debbie harry and thom from radiohead have all had such fine voices that it was a pleasure working with them they were all brave enough to say do what you want with it
984061 oh if i had a carte blanche i think id like to produce rather than remix theres something which is very appealing about being able to spread your technique over a whole album rather than just on one or two tracks you also get more time to interact with the band or person themselves rather than a taped version
984062 heh im going to be trundling the dog out on the road to a few select venues around europe london is boycotted because of the sheer amount of style fascists per square metre sorry the live sound now has a bass player so it should be storming well worth travelling a hundred miles to see in my humble opinion live performances mean going there and doing it without just pressing play on your digital muititrack people can do that with your music at home bobbing around behind the mixing desk is no longer enough either people expect some sort of show and i hope i can deliver it

984081 it was a lack of communication on your part that made me determine that we could not work together sometimes as individuals we feel that we do not wish to communicate and there is a place for that but we need to overcome that also if you agree to form higher and more successful connections
984082 louis i hope all is well busy i am sure

984273 that is not really new of course charlie parker too wrote new themes on familiar chord sequences we wanted to make an album that sounded superficially like straight ahead jazz but is full of shifts of intonation in the details
984274 all of the pieces are structured so that we used twenty four notes in all not just the twelve chromatic ones that means there is another small step between the semitones we used it in very different ways sometimes a bit bluesy in single notes sometimes as a whole chord that is shifted slightly sometimes there is a bass line with certain transitional notes it produces a slightly different sound
984275 the challenge was to make something that not only plays well and stays close to the original if that had been the case you may as well have listened to the originals from 1957
984276 we wanted to retain the sensual level of the music but then make something new out of it we could have made a quarter tone album that was completely dissonant but we did not want to destroy the traditional mood of the music so that the listeners can find their way into it on one level or another or even listen to it on two levels
984277 charlie parker and dizzy gillespie were absolutely avant garde back then
984278 they came out of swing but they were totally radical for their time there is after all an artistic thinking behind jazz that goes far beyond the idea of reproduction for all the veneration you have to think about why coltrane and parker were so good back then because they were original and resolute
984279 either are not in a position to find the beautiful aspects of the tradition or those to whom simply nothing new occurs any longer

984336 discovery is a very serious issue to business today there are real stakes and real penalties associated with poorly handled discovery in the past few years we have seen cases where defendants have faced jail time and millions of dollars in sanctions or penalties
984337 as the volume of data continues to amass doubling in size every 18 to 24 months strategic steps should be taken so that electronic discovery can be handled correctly
984338 if companies have systems in place they can really help ease the pain associated with discovery requests
984339 by developing a wide ranging standardized written plan as well as processes that address all of the components of discovery from records management through evidence collection preservation and production discovery related risks can be mitigated and costs managed
984340 courts appear to be appreciative of organizations and their counsel when the companies have implemented a standardized practice and written policies practices and procedures that are utilized to govern discovery procedures
984341 by implementing a policy of transparency internally companies can effectively react to discovery requests communicate with opposing counsel and significantly decrease errors when litigation arises

984346 my sons have been cooking with me since the age of five and have never asked to go to mcdonalds because they understand the poor nutritional choices available on the menu
984347 parents often underestimate their kids s learning capabilities in regards to the kitchen
984348 proper education of foods at an early age means better eating habits and even decision making in adulthood

984354 michael vaughans decision is his own decision but i cant believe that paul collingwood made that decision off his own back
984355 clearly they want to unite the job and get one bloke in there and theyve given paul a gentle nudge to say that this is in the best interests of the team
984356 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
984357 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
984358 its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
984359 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time
984360 when youre supposed to be at dinner with friends or the wife youre thinking about who should be opening the bowling the next day and how to tell your mate hes not in the next team

984424 people need to learn about the system by any means as long as they become educated about the injustices that are happening in the immigration system and especially inside the detention centers
984425 the only way to ever change this is to have a strong base of people who will make the government accountable for how it treats immigrants
984426 the videos and audio on our website and youtube provide a way for clients to talk about their experience in detention while remaining relatively anonymous it is very important for each of them to have their own voice when describing what happened to them we have received a lot of positive responses from these videos
984427 there are a lot of problems with child detention locking up kids who might not have had a say in the situation is a problem

984466 flextor expects to have revenues in the fiscal year that it is just completing of approximately 15 million a v c had revenues in its last fiscal year of approximately 3 5 million we expect that both of these acquisitions will be accretive to both cecos revenues and earnings the acquisition of flextor fits in with our goal of expanding our international business the acquisition of avc increases our traditionally high margin parts business
984467 we expect a strong drilling and production market both in the u s and internationally in 2009 as demand for oilfield services increases and equipment utilization improves allis chalmers anticipates being in a unique position to benefit from its integrated service offerings
984468 continuing strength in international markets coupled with healthy demand in the u s helped drive higher worldwide sales of semiconductors in june
984469 key demand drivers for semiconductors especially personal computers which account for 40 of semiconductor sales and mobile phones which drive about 20 of demand continued to show double digit unit growth
984470 weve continued to grow our business substantially while generating synergies in our u s futures business and producing operating margins that reflect our disciplined approach to growth this consistently strong performance provides us with the balance sheet and cash flows necessary to execute the share repurchase program recently authorized by our board of directors even as we continue to invest for future growth this program reflects our belief that the current share price does not appropriately reflect the strong underlying fundamentals of our global business in compliance with sec rules we will begin the repurchase of shares after the creditex acquisition closes
984471 we anticipate that this acquisition will be immediately accretive to earnings and add 7 to 9 cents to diluted earnings per share during our first full year of ownership
984472 when combined with our existing business in north america we anticipate annual oem supply revenues of over 600 million in this region over the next year
984473 domestic sales continued to weaken in the second quarter given challenging market conditions

984497 we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
984498 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
984499 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women
984500 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
984501 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
984502 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest

984553 the hhs secretary virtually unlimited powers to declare an emergency and order smallpox treatment that could include forced immunizations detainment and quarantines
984554 to this computerized dossier on your private life from commercial sources add every piece of information that government has about you passport application drivers license and bridge toll records judicial and divorce records complaints from nosy neighbors to the fbi your lifetime paper trail plus the latest hidden camera surveillance and you have the supersnoops dream a total information awareness about every u s citizen
984555 this section will give the hhs secretary unlimited power to define a real or potential threat to take any measures he decides and to do it for as long as he wants
984556 its alice in wonderland time again an emergency is just what the secretary says it is
984557 gives the federal government new powers and increases federal expenditures completely contradicting what members were told about the bill
984558 these new power grabs are being rushed through congress without giving members the ability to debate or even properly study this proposal
984559 i must oppose this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same
984560 were making a huge mistake passing the bill at this time
984561 if necessity is the mother of invention then politics is the mother of bureaucracy
984562 include centralized database provisions airport security unchecked power to cabinet officials extent of the new bureaucracy concentration of power in the executive branch suspension of the rule that prohibits secret advisory committee meetings limited public access to information and failure to address border security and immigration issues such as the tracking of foreign students
984563 the health and safety of citizens from epidemics and bioterrorism
984564 just remove governor from the old bill and insert secretary and magically you have a federal bill that was firmly rejected by voters across the country
984565 we need an honest accounting of how this will work its too frightening to allow it to be rammed through
984566 still allow people the right to compensation or the right to sue if they believe theyve been harmed by the use of a particular vaccine
984567 only require that individuals seeking compensation begin by seeking resolution through the vaccine injury and compensation program
984568 i call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life
984569 man needs only his free will no matter what it costs and where it leads
984570 their feet are swift to shed blood destruction and misery are in their ways and the way of peace they have not known
984571 the lord is longsuffering and abundant in mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression but he by no means clears the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation
984572 my grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in weakness
984573 therefore let those suffering in accordance with gods will entrust themselves to a faithful creator while continuing to do good
984574 if you are reviled for the name of christ you are blessed because the spirit of glory which is the spirit of god is resting on you but let none of you suffer as a murderer a thief a criminal or even as a mischief maker yet if any of you suffers as a christian do not consider it a disgrace but glorify god because you bear this name
984575 therefore just as through one man sin entered the world and death through sin death spread to all men because all sinned
984576 beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravenous wolves
984577 not everyone who says to me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does the will of my father in heaven
984578 but why do you call me lord lord and do not do the things which i say
984579 false christs and false prophets who will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive if possible even the elect
984580 for i know this that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you not sparing the flock also from among yourselves men will rise up speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after themselves
984581 but there were also false prophets among the people even as there will be false teachers among you who will secretly bring in destructive heresies even denying the lord who bought them and bring on themselves swift destruction
984582 beloved do not believe every spirit but test the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets have gone out into the world
984583 and being found in appearance as a man he jesus humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death even the death of the cross
984584 without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins
984585 christ was offered once to bear the sins of many
984586 at the end of the ages jesus has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself
984587 humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he will lift you up
984588 blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
984589 and as i hung up the phone it occurred to me hed grown up just like me my boy was just like me
984590 i the lord your god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me but showing mercy to thousands to those who love me and keep my commandments
984591 i will make your descendants as the dust of the earth so that if a man could number the dust of the earth then your descendants also could be numbered
984592 i will bless those who bless you and i will curse him who curses you and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed
984593 i have found david the son of jesse a man after my own heart who will do all my will from this mans seed according to the promise god raised up for israel a savior jesus
984594 did all the same sins his father before him had done abijah was not faithful to the lord his god as david his great grandfather had been
984595 because the lord loved david the lord gave him a kingdom in jerusalem and allowed him to have a son to be king after him the lord also kept jerusalem safe
984596 i am not doing this for you abijah but because of the relationship i had with your great grandfather david i will show mercy to you
984597 thus says the lord the god of david your father ancestor i have heard your prayer i have seen your tears surely i will heal you
984598 hezekiah i am not doing this just for your sake i am doing it because of my relationship with your ancestor david
984599 i call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both you and your descendants may live

984601 president musharraf will take the oath as a civilian president on the 29th and he will pay farewell visits to various military headquarters on the 27th and 28th
984602 martial law and dictatorship are not in the countrys interest
984603 my party will not become part of any coalition government under president musharraf in future
984604 we believe that any government serving under musharraf will be illegal and undemocratic
984605 we are concerned that elections will be rigged but we dont want to leave the field empty
984606 the bomber repeatedly tried to carry the child to the back of benazir bhuttos bulletproof van and hand over the infant either to bhutto or any other ppp leader on board the truck but something always prevented him from getting close

984611 i can confirm that the last petition has been dismissed
984612 what we want from all political parties is a total boycott of the election because these are fraudulent elections
984613 there is a strain of thought in some parties that an election campaign could be used to discredit musharraf but i think they are making a mistake rather than discrediting him by participating in elections we should boycott them to discredit him
984614 this is time to launch a movement against musharraf because everyone is united against him all he is trying to do is to cling to power musharraf must resign i am confident musharraf will have to go
984615 but he chided us for showing weakness and he said we should urge the youth of pakistan to go on a token hunger strike to press for the restoration of the judiciary

984648 the fact that 56 000 americans each year are contracting hiv for the first time is a wake up call for all of us in the u s
984649 these numbers are a scathing indictment of how profoundly u s and cdc hiv prevention efforts have failed
984650 identifying all those who are infected and linking them to treatment is the only way to break the chain of new infections and begin to address the nations runaway epidemic
984651 every year more than 15 000 people are dying from this disease and aids is a major killer for some of our minority communities
984652 the key thing we have to focus on now is what how and when do we begin to enhance the prevention responses to end this epidemic
984653 now it is a matter of avoiding future wound healing disorders infections strong side effects caused by the drugs and in particular any rejective reaction
984654 i have chest pressure and i think i am having a heart attack
984655 it clearly has to do with estrogen and estrogen receptors
984656 my first symptoms with lupus were that my hands were swollen
984657 they were very stiff to the point that brushing my teeth was hard just holding the toothbrush
984658 the survival rate is really over 90 percent in five to 10 years of having the disease in the 1950s it was probably 50 percent
984659 it can make a big difference for patients who have mild disease
984660 there is an aspect of ultraviolet light that can damage dna in the cells
984661 this sets off an inflammatory reaction that causes the rash we know as lupus rash

984666 here in south carolina it became an african american disease
984667 we refuse to be quiet thats whats going to save the lives of our children talking about it and not hiding it
984668 we want anyone regardless of who they are to say i need to know my status
984669 after 27 years of aids we are still combating a mentality of fear and shame
984670 people still believe that you get hiv aids from touching someone from hugging someone
984671 the first arm of defense against this disease is to educate them
984672 but now more than ever before the church holds a solution to the hiv aids epidemic
984673 i joke about being a 70 year old woman giving out condoms

984695 ungerecht weil sie nach h he des gehaltes nach oben veredelt und nach unten verelendet
984696 unsere eltern sind auch irgendwann der arbeit nachgezogen und haben vom staat nicht verlangt dass er eine t gliche heimfahrt von mehr als 200 kilometern subventioniert
984697 da mag es ausnahmen geben die wir regeln k nnen aber prinzipiell scheint mir eine deckelung nach oben vern nftig zu sein
984698 wer wie herr huber und die csu in bayern nur die wiedereinf hrung der pendlerpauschale ab dem ersten kilometer fordert gibt leuten wie mir mit hohem einkommen eine noch h here pendlerpauschale
984699 mein nachbar hingegen der im tiefbau arbeitet kinder hat und nicht sehr viel verdient bek me weiterhin gar nichts unsere wegekosten sind aber gleich und f r ihn sogar eine weit h here belastung das ist doch alles in hohem ma e ungerecht

984705 he stressed the fundamentals he puts a lot of time into it i cant even imagine how much time he puts into it
984706 my third season with him our team got off to a terrible 0 5 start the worst as start in something like 21 years
984707 he pounded that into us over and over and over perhaps too much
984708 but we began to win and we ended up winning 17 straight games after that which i think is somewhere in the record book
984709 the as are his life and he takes his job as coach very seriously
984710 it would have been nice to see him grow up
984711 he was very respectful i think he would have been someone very special
984712 just wanted to please john he always tried his hardest just so he wouldnt let john down john perry is one of those people who command respect rather than demand it
984713 this guy cares about baseball but beyond that he cares about children
984714 baseball is just the tool he uses to teach kids about life

984727 just as the company slowly diversified the ipod lineup and entered lower price points with every new version
984728 we expect apple to launch new models of the iphone at lower price points in calendar year 2009
984729 this rumour still doesnt make any sense to me for this year
984730 taking features out of the current iphone loses 10 or more of revenue for every 1 saved in build costs iphone nano would have to outsell iphone by a large factor 5 10 times the sales to make sense
984731 a cut down version of the original iphone with the candy bar shape of ipod nano music players would be a huge hit as a christmas gift
984732 after being overwhelmed by the enormous demand for the new iphone 3g that led to widespread sellouts of the new cell phone across the country apple appears to be slowly catching up with supplies
984733 jobs has so effectively turned his charisma and personality traits into business processes of apple that he could easily step away and the company would continue to function quite well without him
984734 chief operating officer tim cook whose laconic southern style distinguishes him from the intense jobs has won praise from analysts for his firm grasp of day to day operations and is thought to be a likely successor
984735 jobs may be the public face of products like the ipod but it is apples top flight design team led by jonathan ives that is responsible for the iconic shapes of the companys computers and gadgets
984736 steve clearly is the voice of the company but it would be a big mistake to state that hes the only one driving the vision of apple
984737 one hedge fund hired a private detective to tail jobs
984738 but a little disclosure on that front might go a long way to calming wall streets rattled nerves
984739 hacking the iphone is of more value than establishing the very freedoms that allow you to express your opinions
984740 the cause served by such efforts is as noble as that of the founding fathers of my nation and no less important possibly more important in fact
984741 ok ok ok its fun and satisfying to buck the
984742 lets make sure we make the most money off of this incase its a total bust
984743 117 apple stores reported having sold out of all models and only 27 stores indicated they had all three models in stock
984744 but be sure to arrive early since iphone 3g is sold on a first come first served basis
984745 try to create a new user account on your computer and plug in your iphone to a different usb port
984746 we dont know when we will have more stock and if we did we wouldnt tell you emphasis on you
984747 you think im an arrogant expletive who thinks hes above the law and i think youre a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong
984748 contradicted the reporting that times reporter john markoff and i did this week while his health problems amounted to a good deal more than a common bug they werent life threatening and he doesnt have a recurrence of cancer
984749 apple simply cant be trusted to tell truth about its chief executive under mr jobs apple has created a culture of secrecy that has served it well in many ways the speculation over which products apple will unveil at the annual macworld conference has been one of the companys best marketing tools but that same culture poisons its corporate governance apple tells analysts far less about its operations than most companies do it turns low level decisions into state secrets directors are often left out of the loop and it dissembles with impunity
984750 apple tells analysts far less about its operations than most companies do
984751 you would think hed want them apples board to know before me but apparently not
984752 tell us all of the health issues has steve had over the last 6 months
984753 you would think hed want them to know before me
984754 poisons its corporate governance apple tells analysts far less about operations than most companies do
984755 it took 74 days to sell the first one million original iphones so the new iphone 3g is clearly off to a great start around the world
984756 we underestimated the number of phones sold per hour throughout the weekend and apples recovery from activation issues while we believe fridays 24 phones per hour is probably a close guess for friday the number likely increased significantly on saturday and sunday well above our previous estimate of 28 phones per hour
984757 45 000 as this post reads please fix if this is an incorrect statement
984758 state of the art products at pricepoints our competitors cant match
984759 what it is now is all it ever will be
984760 it took 74 days to sell the first one million original iphones so the new iphone 3g is clearly off to a great start around the world
984761 first weekend estimates exceeded our 425k estimate based on strength in international and improvement in activation process throughout the weekend
984762 1 international availablilty in 21 countries and 2 a 60 lower entry level price point
984763 i thought by now everybody who wanted one would have bought it
984764 apple makes me cool and special like everybody else who has the white earbuds
984765 i told you that apple iscool so from er 2006
984766 he serves as the ceo at the pleasure of apples board and has no plans to leave apple steves health is a private matter
984767 we give you guidance that we have reasonable confidence of achieving
984768 we put it to shazam a free program from the app store
984769 apple shares rebounding at the close and have just passed into green territory go figure
984770 all has been rectified by aaaaapppplee and now is seamless lick lick elegant suck suck and way better than the unstable not user friendly and cluncky applications that all of the competition try to provide blatantly copying apple
984771 serious issue with one of our mail servers that has prevented you from accessing your mobile me mail account for the last week
984772 we apologize for this service outage and the frustration it has caused you
984773 friends ran into some trouble with mobileme when it first went live now except for e mail everything works fine push pull whatever apple is doing a fine job
984774 i cant imagine what its been like for the estimated 20 000 loyal apple customers who paid their 99 or 149 for a family pack and havent had e mail service for days or even weeks on end
984775 just look at the biggest companies in the world most are using exchange and will not be parting ways for mobileme anytime soon or ever
984776 level 2 solution of having someone from tech support call me at this point i have not received a call back
984777 apple is doing great in the u s but outside the u s they are not making the cut as much as all the other players
984778 plus they do not have their os in many different languages if at all
984779 everytime i purchase a new one seems in 6 months that the operating system is out of date now they have changed the mac email and website and my os 10 3 9 will not allow me to use all the new gadgets that are on mobileme com
984780 the author states if you add in ipods and iphones it is a new ball game he is partly right apple would gain ground but if you did this then you have to include every windows mobile device and mp3 players that use the windows mobile platform
984781 plus they do not have their os in many different languages if at all
984782 see like apple news has been all good for some time and yet the stock has stayed pretty static during this period why
984783 the author states if you add in ipods and iphones it is a new ball game he is partly right apple would gain ground but if you did this then you have to include every windows mobile device and mp3 players that use the windows mobile platform
984784 mac news from outside the reality distortion field by philip elmer dewitt
984785 apple does a lot more than the iphone would be nice to read some news on that front like why are apple displays still 800 with 5 year old technology when you can buy others with better specs for 1 3 the price
984786 investors chose to ignore this and gave aapl a free pass

984788 i am willing to make a significant bet that on a short term basis apples share price will deteriorate
984789 we believe aapl will likely continue its tradition of conservative guidance
984790 thats the cycle these days apple provides ultra conservative guidance and down appl goes

984877 in fact nearly half of all pet owners told us they are skeptical of the quality of existing online pet sources
984878 webvet gives pet owners access to credible information that for the first time encompasses both the physical and emotional needs of their pets
984879 without a doubt the veterinarian is the most trusted authority for pet owners but the reality is that owners turn to the internet on a daily basis for health and wellness information
984880 owners are confused about where to go and whom to trust and thats why webvets expert resources make it easier to be a better pet parent
984881 because webvet offers one trusted and reliable place for pet owners to gather information about health care for pets it is a tremendous asset to both consumers and veterinarians
984882 a well informed pet owner can be very helpful to veterinarians when making decisions regarding the best course of action for their pets health
984883 we want pet owners to have the resources they need to fully embrace and engage in their pets health and wellness as they would their own
984884 webvet is the first resource that truly focuses on a pets body mind and soul combining ones own personal knowledge of what their pet needs with their veterinarians knowledge relative to their physical health
984885 pet owners are deeply involved in all aspects of their pets lives
984886 webvet provides an informative and credible resource outside of the veterinarians office that educates pet owners about raising a healthy and happy pet

984894 there have been questions about the access to the internet and other issues at the olympic centers
984895 we think the chinese government needs to heed those concerns that if china is going to demonstrate it is truly moving forward as a modern society this is part of it
984896 the international olympic committee and the beijing organizing committee of the olympic games should fulfill their commitment to full media freedom and provide immediate uncensored internet access at olympic media venues
984897 censorship of the internet at the games is compromising fundamental human rights and betraying the olympic values
984898 they bit off more than they could chew and the victims of their overweening ambition is us
984899 we are a victim of our own success to a degree
984900 i was getting creamed so its probably a good thing in that respect
984901 scrabble and scrabulous are not really about the game what makes them fun is the way they help me connect with the personalities of my friends and family

984919 a large percentage of beef being consumed in kenya could actually originate from tanzanian animals
984920 this is a good day for the people of tanzania and an embarrassing day for biwater
984921 questions remain however over whether biwater and its uk shareholders will honour the debts of city water services and pay the 3 million plus 500 000 that the tanzanian authorities were awarded in january 2008 in a separate case
984922 tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world and it is clear that water privatisation was a failed policy pushed by the world bank in return for debt relief hopefully now the government of tanzania can put the biwater water privatisation fiasco behind it and focus on making the much needed improvements to water and sanitation in tanzania
984923 the whole process of privatising water services in dar es salaam was opposed by civil society here however under pressure from the world bank the government of tanzania moved on with the privatisation the subsequent failure of this policy and now the legal case should be a lesson to the world bank aid donors and governments that privatisation is not a solution for problems in developing countries in fact this failure has added a burden to a country that is already struggling to reach its international poverty targets on access to water

984984 i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the republicans as a partisan witch hunt because i think weve got too many problems to solve
984985 i dont think the next president will do that no matter who he is
984986 i think a lot of us feel that the american people are entitled to the whole truth
984987 the american people are entitled to an investigation from an official body that has access to the classified documents that makes as much public as it can
984988 pardon any official from cabinet secretary on down who might plausibly face prosecution
984989 a lot of people think that that is not something that goes over well with the american people
984990 what we have much more of a tradition of is presidential fact finding commissions
984991 something like this would be unprecedented in the american experience and i think it would be absolutely necessary
984992 presidential commissions and national security the politics of damage control
984993 weve had panels that have looked at scandals weve had panels that have looked at intractable political problems

985008 we welcome a new approach to evaluate broadband performance and believe the samknows research takes the industry a step towards a clearer understanding of the differences between providers
985009 the preliminary report whilst only conducted with a small sample size demonstrates a clear difference between fibre optic broadband and broadband provided over copper telephone wires and reinforces our position as the leading broadband provider in the uk
985010 virgin media believes in open and transparent marketing of its products and we look forward to working with samknows to help develop testing methodology further
985011 our virgin media dsl service is unique in offering a truly unlimited broadband service through all tiers
985012 the appeal of this unlimited service combined with great valuepackages has resulted in a growing demand for our products which has meant an increase in network congestion
985013 were working hard to address this as a priority and are looking to make significant changes to our non cable broadband service in the near future
985014 bt and plusnet were both demonstrated to use traffic shaping at peak times on non port 80 traffic although and perhaps surprisingly no other isps demonstrated such usage future work will be conducted in this area to see how this affects other applications
985015 also whilst raw speed is important there are other aspects that some providers should be looking at even more closely
985016 i think were going to see significant speed congestion issues next time unless upgrades of core network bandwidth is carried out to account for increasingly faster access speeds
985017 we cannot accept people paying money for tickets and not getting them

985037 mange kunstnere er ofte villige til at g meget p kompromis samt at optr de gratis for at komme ud med deres kunst men s vidt muligt vores konomi tillader det er det vigtigt for os at anerkende at kunstnerne skal kunne leve af deres kunst
985038 der er selvf lgelig nogle fysiske begr nsninger i rummet der er forholdsvis sm t og lyden giver en del genklang s man kommer nok ikke til at opleve s mange heavy metal koncerter herinde men vi er ikke snobbede p nogen m de
985039 og vi vil meget gerne blande tingene s der for eksempel kommer nogle og laver visuals til koncerterne eller udstiller eller noget helt tredje
985040 i dont support additional legislation because i think we have authority
985041 network management has never been defined and they are now saying we are defining it now and you violated it
985042 what this means is that the internet is the first mass medium with a legal guaranteed access for anybody
985043 we believe the order which we think will be favored by an fcc majority will be negative for comcast and set some precedents that could trouble other cable and even telecom broadband providers
985044 the reason why you cant do enforcement on the principles alone is that they arent rules and they didnt go through the rulemaking process that is required to make regulation
985045 harmonix and mtv games believe in an open standard philosophy of hardware and game compatibility there should be interoperability between music instrument controllers across all music games

985091 itll dramatically change the way they live and the way they enjoy the internet users wont have to go back to their individual house or business or hotspot for broadband theyll be able to do it wherever they want
985092 we were going 40 miles per hour i had a laptop i was making a youtube video and browsing a web site at the same time
985093 you can aim the base station radio directly toward the pockets of underserved communities
985094 thinking should become your capital asset no matter whatever ups and downs you come across in your life
985095 thinking is progress non thinking is stagnation of the individual organization and the country thinking leads to action knowledge without action is useless and irrelevant knowledge with action converts adversity into prosperity
985096 when you speak speak the truth perform when you promise discharge your trust withhold your hands from striking and from taking that which is unlawful and bad
985097 what actions are most excellent to gladden the heart of a human being to feed the hungry to help the afflicted to lighten the sorrow of the sorrowful and to remove the wrongs of injured
985098 away fond thoughts and vex my soul no more work claimed my wakeful nights my busy days albeit brought memories of rameswaram shore yet haunt my dreaming gaze
985099 i will not be presumptuous enough to say that my life can be a role model for anybody but some poor child living in an obscure place in an underprivileged social setting may find a little solace in the way my destiny has been shaped it could perhaps help such children liberate themselves from the bondage of their illusory backwardness and hopelessness
985100 my worthiness is all my doubt his merit all my fear contrasting which my quality does however appear

985117 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
985118 our sympathy goes to them but we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate or find other tickets
985119 we warned folk to only deal with authorized ticket suppliers
985120 the worst thing is that some people dont even know yet that they bought tickets that wont arrive
985121 some were told they could pick up the tickets at an office in beijing and they wont be there my guess is they sold thousands of tickets that dont exist
985122 the downgrade reflects that we no longer consider deutsche banks performance to be materially stronger than that of the leading peers in the currently difficult operating environment
985123 although the banks performance is still reasonably sound its earnings for the past 12 months have been affected by 7 1 billion euros 11 0 billion in major markdowns impairments and credit valuation adjustments
985124 the announcement by the former holding company of indymac bank has no impact on indymac federal bank or its customers our customers will continue to receive the same value and personal service they have come to expect from indymac which due to its fdic backing is one of the safest banks in america and a great place for our customers to keep their funds
985125 we have serious concerns about huds current real estate settlement procedures act proposal and we oppose its finalization in anywhere near its current form
985126 if hud adopts a final rule now without coordinating with the fed board it will be to the detriment of consumers forcing them to confront a baffling host of disclosures and forcing the mortgage industry to comply with inconsistent rules
985127 zune is about having a choice with zune you can customize the back of the player with laser etching you can pick your own background image on the player you can listen to the radio without an add on and for the price of one cd a month you can have access to millions of tracks
985128 you can also share the music you listen to on your pc and your zune player with friends in the zune social online music community myspace and facebook
985129 zune is not fading away and again we are pleased with our progress against an entrenched competitor apple
985130 zune is a long term investment for microsoft today there is much focus on the stand alone portable media player but if you look across the entertainment and devices division at microsoft you can see how in the not too distant future a customers entertainment experience could flow across the pc xbox mobile phones and automotive
985131 it was literally resistant to every meaningful antibiotic that we had
985132 so we had this report and i looked at it and said to myself my god this is an organism that basically we cant treat
985133 researchers have concluded that any two people on average are distanced by just 6 6 degrees of separation meaning that they could be linked by a string of seven or fewer acquaintances
985134 the whole reason we went out and acquired the license and that we now own fallout is that we clearly intended to make more than one
985135 this is not something were going to do once and then go away and never do it again
985136 when that will be or how long that will be god only knows but we acquired it specifically because we wanted to own it and develop it and work on it like we do with the elder scrolls

985157 this is a media war on the part of the taliban and al qaeda aimed at exaggerating their victories as well as getting maximum sympathies of the masses through horrific footage and emotional sermons
985158 the sophisticated editing of these dvds particularly the mixing of clips of hollywood action movies with locally taken footages of the military activities of the militants show the incredible skillful expertise behind these propaganda films
985159 the price of an exclusive dvd and tape depends on the kind of footage
985160 most of the global tv channels are interested in the footages of militant activities showing some high profile figures slaughtering of kidnapped people or soldiers the price of a dvd can vary from hundreds of dollars to thousands of dollars

985182 best buy and a number of other large retail chains realize theyre running out of space to open new stores
985183 if you look at the run rate of the major retailers for the past 10 to 15 years its just going to be physically impossible to keep that up in perpetuity
985184 the limits of what these big boxes are leads retailers to continue to want to find a way to experiment
985185 the question from the consumer is what do you accept from the brand and what feels foreign
985186 retailers are trying to give the shopper a reason to hang out in their store rather than just come in and purchase what they need

985201 if somebodys making a personal call and youre under your bucket of minutes or youre making it at night or on the weekends whats your cost i would argue the cost of a free minute should be nothing
985202 its completely unreasonable to have to keep track of calls at that level
985203 especially as the cost of these devices have come down you can get these mega minute plans where theres really no additional cost for personal calls
985204 back in 1989 when cell phones were huge and when it cost a lot of money to make a phone call nowadays theyre a dime a dozen and the cost is way down

985206 one of the first things you should do is you need to get your psychological house in order
985207 it can be something as simple as visiting family members you havent seen in a long time or taking long walks with your spouse the key is reducing that stress thats the most important thing upfront to deal with
985208 the biggest problem i see with candidates is they just feel panicked and start calling everybody they know
985209 do tell people but dont run helter skelter do it in a timely and selective manner
985210 you might want to sharpen that up a little bit if youre going to be calling people and asking them for their help you really need to get your story down
985211 if you have a contact a professional who can help you reach out to them right away
985212 but it needs to be someone who if you blow that first impression you havent lost an opportunity
985213 the biggest waste of time is getting a quality network contact on the phone and leaving the impression youre asking for a job
985214 ninety nine percent of the time the person youre calling even if they wanted to help doesnt have a job for you

985222 disengage with the term obese and believe that it does not relate to their child
985223 explored the use of the word obese and the vast majority of parents were adamant that this should not be used especially when discussing children
985224 the department of healths decision not to tell parents the exact bmi of their children but to give them only some vague sliding scale of where their children are on the bmi range is rubbish
985225 it will not deliver the demand that the chief medical officer made in 2003 that the early signs of unhealthy weight need to be identified
985226 although the department recognises that there is no better way of calculating healthy unhealthy weight other than using bmi and mistakenly states that bmi growth charts can be found in the childs personal child health records it states that some parents might find bmi charts confusing
985227 the department of healths solution not to give anyone a bmi figure for their children in either reception year or year 6
985228 this flies in the face of the departments policy recognising that parents are the principal care givers and denies them knowledge
985229 diabetes uk welcomes this move as it is extremely worrying that many parents cannot see if their child is overweight
985230 parents need to be educated about the dangers of obesity and obesity related conditions such as type 2 diabetes
985231 i find this particular line from the government tip toeing through the daffodils
985232 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice

985273 who do you think should pay for your health care
985274 these results highlight the root cause of the healthcare crisis our nation is currently grappling with says vitality ceo art carlos right
985275 we americans or rather our lifestyles lie at the heart of rising medical costs and the problem will not be solved until we are required to take personal accountability for the way we choose to live
985276 the only way to stem these escalating healthcare costs is to help people take action to get healthier or insist they pay for their lifestyle choices that adversely affect the pocketbooks of others
985277 despite the fact that people recognize their behavior can impact their healthcare costs that knowledge obviously isnt enough to motivate them to action
985278 on inspection engineers determined that fluid was coming from the spoiler actuator that was not evident before departure
985279 about five minutes after taking off it was very obvious the plane was very low in the sky it was very strange and for 45 minutes we did not know what was going on
985280 the best evidence suggests it was a puncture in the area of the tyre where the sidewall meets the shoulder probably from debris
985281 there was no prior indication of a problem it was not running above normal temperature or below normal pressure and there was no damage to the tread area
985282 a flat spot makes you more vulnerable to a puncture because it makes the tyre thinner in that area and therefore you have less protection against debris damage
985283 last year i probably lost the championship on a puncture so its nothing new to me
985284 i just want the stuff taken out of which he knows to be untrue

985292 leto is een erg getalenteerde speler met ervaring in de champions league hij maakt ook deel uit van de argentijnse kern voor de olympische spelen verschillende clubs hebben al laten weten dat ze hem willen huren maar ik reken zeker nog op hem
985293 als ferguson een speler wil houden stelt hij daar alles voor in het werk en meer dan waarschijnlijk zal het hem nu opnieuw lukken al wat hij onderneemt is in het belang van man u niemand is groter dan de club dus ga ik ervan uit dat de portugees gewoon bij united blijft
985294 ondanks stevige beloftes van de voorbije jaren en het herhaaldelijk aandringen op bestrijding is dit niet gebeurd waardoor de pluisjes zich momenteel volop aan het verspreiden zijn en er ook volgend jaar opnieuw de nodige overlast zal zijn

985298 t hese are important ideas because they undermine the notion that free markets exist as neutral arbiters showing markets as artificial constructs with important regulatory choices built into them this is a newly emergent set of ideas and who controls their interpretation will control the public policy choices they imply as we move into an era where free market fundamentalism dies its important to keep our eyes on the framers of the new intellectual moment ideas can be used to prop up the corrupt system we have now or to renew it
985299 39 things i have learned as i prepare to turn 40
985300 snow and ice must be removed from sidewalks with 12 hours of daylight after snow falls or ice is formed
985301 in essence iz refers to municipal zoning ordinances requiring that a certain portion of a new residential development be set at a price achievable by low income families
985302 mandatory iz ordinances do not work in the market and are not authorized by minnesota law if a community seeks to provide housing to those with lower income levels the best means is through existing housing stock it is not sound policy to balance the needs of a community on new developments when the greatest resource is in preserving existing housing
985303 in practice iz hasnt worked as intended either in burlington vt where inclusionary zoning has been in effect for 15 years a total of 180 units or 12 units a year have been built and in montgomery county md which has a population of almost a million about 300 units per year are being built clearly iz is not likely to result in much new affordable housing
985304 while many people can barely afford to save for retirement it is difficult to justify the extraordinarily generous taxpayer contribution they are forced to pay into top mandarins schemes
985305 these costs are clearly exorbitant compared to what the public can expect their own employers to put in the government cannot afford to stick its head in the sand any longer over public sector pensions
985306 we need an independent commission to look at the options for reform of pensions for the next generation of public sector employees they must be fair and affordable both for civil servants and taxpayers

985313 vroeger metselden mensen vaker iets tussen de stenen dat noem je een bouwoffer ze deden dat vooral bij belangrijke gebouwen dat deden de mensen omdat ze dachten dat ik boze geesten kon verjagen ook moest ik de middeleeuwse bouwvakkers beschermen tegen de ratten

985317 we hebben nu geen noodzaak gezien om daarop afschrijvingen te doen eind dit jaar kijken we er weer naar maar zelfs als we dan afschrijvingen moeten doen zal dat onze solvabiliteit niet raken
985318 eerder dachten we dat deze eind dit jaar wellicht over zou zijn nu rekenen we erop dat deze nog tot in 2009 aanhoudt
985319 aan de andere kant ook niet ik houd er eigenlijk niet van als mensen me tijdens de voorbereidingen op de vingers kijken het liefst zit ik alleen te proberen maar goed ik heb er zelf in toegestemd en vind het toch ook wel weer leuk
985320 hoe kan dat nou er zou hier om 14 00 uur iemand van de orgelcommissie zijn
985321 het is altijd weer wennen hier in nederland in canada zijn alle orgels elektropneumatisch n ze hebben een andere pedaalligging
985322 nee ik kan maar een klein beetje noten lezen net genoeg om te kunnen zien wanneer er omgeslagen moet worden
985323 als het allemaal wat zwart wordt in de partituur kan ik wel zien dat er een snelle passage aankomt eigenlijk registreer ik bijna nooit ik doe het ook liever niet maar voor vandaag had andr niemand anders volgens hem komt het wel goed
985324 laat wil maar omslaan andr het is fijner als zij langs je heen komt dan ik
985325 bij a komt de koppel erbij bij b gaat ie er weer af
985326 s middags ben ik altijd gespannen op de avond zelf ben ik relaxed dan staat alles en je moet wel
985327 de concertcommissie vond een stuk van een halfuur te lang in zaltbommel speel ik m wel helemaal
985328 de laatste jaren ben ik meer gaan spelen wat ik zelf leuk vind daarom zet ik ook rheinberger en reger op de lessenaar het publiek reageert daar soms op ja sommige mensen vinden de derde sonate van mendelssohn al zwaar ik doe het vooral voor mezelf voor de uitdaging
985329 reger dat is toch het lastigste grison lijkt moeilijk maar het zijn veelal dezelfde loopjes
985330 ik hoop dat het vanavond beter gaat maar de registratie hebben we vast
985331 klaas heeft ontzettend veel betekend voor de orgelwereld het feit dat hij ineens werd uitgeschakeld vanwege een hersentumor heeft me geraakt ik speel psalm 42 een beetje ter ere van hem
985332 h hoe kan dat nu dat klopt niet nou dan moet je m maar wat eerder wegdoen bert
985333 jullie doen het goed ik hoop dat het bij mij beter gaat vanavond
985334 vroeger ging ik helemaal op in de muziek tien jaar geleden is er echter een verandering gekomen ik sta er nu heel anders in daarom zonder ik me tegenwoordig voor het concert altijd even af om wijsheid en kracht te vragen want zonder god kan ik niets doen
985335 het ging perfect hier en daar was er wel wat maar dat hoor je bijna niet en het ging soms toch weer anders dan vanmiddag
985336 ik zeg niet zo gauw dat het prima ging reger vond ik wel wat tegenvallen
985337 twee weken terug bij herman van vliet zaten er 35 en die keer daarvoor bij jaap zwart ook je ziet dat het terugloopt de tijd dat hier 200 300 man op zon concert afkwam is voorbij en je moet de concurrentie niet vergeten vanavond waren martin mans en jan vayne bijvoorbeeld in zwolle daar zal het ook mee te maken hebben twee jaar geleden zat hier bij andr nog 150 man
985338 die moet je op historische orgels spelen anders is er geen bal aan maar op het orgel van de leidse hooglandse kerk klinkt het echt niet gek
985339 onvoorstelbaar zijn oeuvre ik speel regelmatig wat van hem maar nooit een heel programma met alleen maar triosonates of concertos daarvoor ontbreekt de motivatie
985340 robuust breed opnieuw je moet er wel een orgel voor hebben
985341 door hem is het bij mij begonnen toen ik asma in de oude kerk van amsterdam hoorde dacht ik dat wil ik ook
985342 van hem speel ik niets ik heb me nooit in hem verdiept maar als het om die richting gaat ontzettend vakkundig
985343 fantastisch als ik een barokstuk wil spelen luister ik eerst hoe koopman het doet
985344 toen ik een aantal jaar geleden in de kerk van luther speelde en toen ik voor het eerst z lf op het orgel van de oude kerk in amsterdam speelde
985345 i was in contract talks before the euros but i stopped it because of the euros and we can sit down together one of these days again
985346 that is my intention always to commit to the club
985347 i love this club it is a great team and it is really nice to be in this team because everyone loves the game
985348 like me i love to play lots of combination football so i am in the right place but you never know unfortunately
985349 i am disappointed and it was a surprise because this is a player who has played in the champions league and been in the argentina squad for the olympic games you have managers talking about how good he is so i think the system needs to change
985350 now we have to look for a solution maybe find a team for him on loan but we have maybe eight or 10 teams in spain italy and greece asking about him when you have eight or 10 teams asking about a player and hes not playing it means that he is good
985351 he has a long contract and i think he can impress and next year will be a different situation
985352 hopefully in the future if hes playing in the champions league maybe someone will say oh we made a mistake
985353 at the end of the day we are talking about the future of a player and i dont think that is fair
985354 the situation has not changed since dick advocaat last commented on it
985355 tottenham offered us 20m 15 8m for andrei but that does not work for us we are waiting for a new proposal
985356 initially we announced that negotiations will start at around 25m 19 8m what the final transfer fee will be in the end is hard to say

985433 what is obligatory is the urgent need to have our national policies programmes activities and achievements clearly explained and disseminated to the benefit of all nigerians an aggressive packaging of our various people oriented programmes especially at the grassroots level is today very impressive similarly there is the need to put in place a process to monitor and understand the feelings and perceptions of government programmes and policies by our rural masses

985448 sekarang ini santri yang generasi muda kian kritis saat mendengar fatwa atau tausiyah mereka tak langsung mengiyakan mereka juga mulai bisa berpikir dalam kasus ini kiai dapat keuntungan berapa

985451 justifikasi keagamaan yang dulu sering dipakai sekarang tidak bisa lagi digunakan di masa lalu gampang saja kiai bisa bilang kalau memilih selain partai persatuan pembangunan bisa masuk neraka sekarang enggak bisa karena kiai memilih banyak parpol dan akibatnya preferensi politik individu jadi semakin otonom
985452 apa yang berkembang kemudian adalah masyarakat yang serba transaksional dan berpikiran ekonomi padahal dalam demokrasi modern bentuk transaksinya bukan dalam konteks ekonomi melainkan lebih pada kebijakan yang kemudian dihasilkan untuk menyejahterakan masyarakat
985453 kalau dahulu figur kiai bisa sangat berpengaruh dan bahkan memiliki kemampuan memaksa sekarang hal seperti itu tidak bisa lagi dilakukan hal itu karena masyarakat tidak lagi memandang sosok kiai dalam konteks seperti itu memang terjadi pergeseran dan rasionalisasi

985474 the pseudo occultism of the present day with its dubious psychism wild theorizing and evidence that cannot stand up to the most cursory examination is but the detritus which accumulates around the base of the mount of vision all such worthless rubbish is not worth the power and shot of argument in order to form a just estimate of the sacred science we must study originals and try to penetrate the minds of the great mystics whose works bear evidence of first hand knowledge of the supersensible worlds

985536 potevo ascoltare i colpi sul suo corpo la polizia si sporgeva sopra rich in modo da poter colpire le parti del mio corpo che restavano esposte
985537 sembrava che si stessero divertendo quando ho gridato di dolore la cosa sembr dare loro ancora pi piacere

985542 non solo una questione di pochi fascisti ubriachi questo un comportamento di massa da parte della polizia nessuno disse no si tratta di cultura fascista

985547 percebemos uma forte mudan a na tradi o quando adeptas do candombl se tornam protestantes mesmo professando uma nova cren a desejam manter sua fonte de renda para isso decidem retirar todos os signos que liguem o quitute religi o africana como a roupa branca o turbante e as contas no pesco o desfiguram o of cio ao querer que o acaraj seja visto n o como uma oferenda mas apenas como uma refei o
985548 tamb m procurei visitar diversos bairros as festas de largo e busquei inclusive os tabuleiros dos considerados evang licos observei o cotidiano de venda nos pontos desde os de menores recursos at os mais consagrados pela opini o popular
985549 a exist ncia do tabuleiro e o fato de ser preparado na rua s o tradi es que devem ser respeitadas isso precisa ser preservado e deixa de ser quando o acaraj passa a ser vendido em restaurantes e delicatessens
985550 h pessoas vendendo o acaraj sem nenhum compromisso com a nossa hist ria com a cultura e preciso preserv la independentemente da religi o preciso saber conviver com as diferen as mas respeitando o lado cultural
985551 eu desconhe o que em algum momento na hist ria jesus cristo tenha comido acaraj para que eles chamem de o bolinho de jesus o acaraj at hoje uma oferenda a ians pertence e sempre pertenceu aos orix s n o podemos e nem queremos impedir quem quer que seja de vender acaraj o que pedimos que respeitem a hist ria
985552 apesar de todas essas mudan as para as baianas leg timas o bolinho de feij o fradinho frito no azeite de dend n o pode ser dissociado do candombl da a import ncia de se manter a receita e lutar para que essa tradi o seja passada de pais para filhos

985563 labcons product launch demonstrates business equipment as one of our strategic short term applications for which mirel will be utilized
985564 this very complicated part demonstrates the versatility and ease with which mirel can be used for injection molding applications until today bioplastics in general have had limited capability in injection molding applications
985565 there has been growing concern within our industry that the disposal of traditional plastics is too wasteful we can now offer customers the opportunity to lower their carbon footprint with our pagoda line of products and many have indicated that they will switch to our new products made from renewable resources we envision this as the first of many products in our pagoda line that will utilize mirel

985582 to defuse the tension we are asking malacanang to defer the signing of the moa in deference to the supreme court
985583 it is unfortunate for both muslims and christians in the philippines that gma has polluted the peace process by negotiating in bad faith promising the milf things she cannot deliver using the process as a backdoor to charter change and ultimately setting the conditions for escalating the conflict in mindanao
985584 gma being a highly unpopular president does not have the social capital to convince filipinos to cede their territory even for something as laudable as peace in mindanao so when the inevitable occurs and the government fails to deliver its promise to the milf the rebels will have a clear casus belli or a justification for acts of war

985592 about thirty years ago there was much talk that geologists ought only to observe and not theorize and i well remember someone saying that at this rate a man might as well go into a gravel pit and count the pebbles and describe the colours how odd it is that anyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service
985593 the recent issuing of another u s patent for our compostable resin line is a testament to the high caliber research and development team at cereplast

985603 for instance in the bags segment bioplastics is replacing polyethylene pe mainly low density polyethylene ldpe
985604 it is also substituting polyethylene in some film applications in the packaging segment
985605 increasing prices of conventional resins are likely to pave the way for the greater usage of bioplastics in asia and other parts of the world
985606 the higher oil prices are responsible for this rise in resin costs which in turn has made bioplastics an attractive raw material alternative for the plastics manufacturing sector
985607 lack of local production as well as the low levels of consumption and public awareness are major barriers to the greater usage of bioplastics
985608 this challenge is likely to diminish as more companies set up manufacturing plants in the region

985617 the spanish director gives an almost wongian expression to the way people seduce one another pondering the manner in which fingertips dance across the surface of things and cuban born consuela leans against a wall her ass teasing the hungry eyes of her ex professor david kepesh even when her angles and cutting begin to feel like too much dithering coixet never loses her sense of humor succinctly acknowledging during in a great scene where bs literally kills a character that artists should stay as true to their art as men like david and george should to the sexual agency society tells them they shouldnt flex
985618 worryingly just 13 of the survey identified approaching baby boomer retirement as a concern despite overwhelming evidence indicating a large exodus of experienced staff from the labour market in the next three to five years
985619 one of the most anticipated workplace trends of the 21st century is the huge retirement wave that will hit most industrialised countries including the us in the next few years
985620 but surveys consistently report that most companies are unprepared to respond to the seismic shifts that are expected to appear in the workforce
985621 the alarm that has been ringing in the ears of senior managers and business owners lately has become louder and more painful as they see retirements and job hopping drain their organisational brain power
985622 it has become all too obvious that companies have not done a very good job of documenting and retaining the knowledge of their key personnel and subject matter experts
985623 for all the public gnashing of teeth about the impending retirement of all those knowledgeable hard working baby boomers relatively few organisations are doing much about it
985624 theyre going to wind up in a mad bar the doors scramble in the near future if they dont start trying to tap the knowledge of their most knowledgeable boomers
985625 retiring baby boomers are taking with them years of institutional memory in many fields
985626 by 2008 a wealth of skills and experience will begin to disappear from the job market the first members of the baby boom generation will turn 62 the average retirement age in the large developed economies of north america europe and asia
985627 over the next 15 years 80 of their workforce growth will occur among people 50 years or older by 2050 40 of europes total population and 60 of its working age population will be people over 60

985637 tesco is one of the uks largest taxpayers for the year to february 2007 we paid over 1bn in the uk in corporation tax business rates employers national insurance contributions and other taxes combined with the approximately 750m of paye tax employees nic and net vat that we collected in that financial year this means we are in the top 10 taxpayers in the uk
985638 it is quite clear that many women are becoming trapped in the vicious cycle of hidden homelessness
985639 the lack of adequate hostel provision and the shocking increase in waiting lists for social housing reflects the failure of the state to understand this complex problem
985640 women are at far greater risk of having to compromise between their own safety and their need to find a place to sleep
985641 it is alarming that in the extreme the most vulnerable women are faced with the unenviable choice of squatting sleeping rough or relying on family or friends for accommodation
985642 we will work with the many great organisations helping the homeless to try to find solutions however sadly a big part of this problem stems from labours failure to build enough housing in every category over the last decade
985643 last year was the first time since 1983 that we built more social houses than were lost through right to buy
985644 but for a generation the supply of housing has not kept up with demand
985645 there was a lot of hate speech sometimes thinly veiled the vernacular radio stations have perfected the art
985646 urging them to support political leaders from their own tribe and to harbor bad feelings about people from other communities
985647 the ethnic hate that the radio stations were propagating about other communities was unbelievable i cannot make myself repeat what they were saying the unfortunate thing is that we as journalists allowed speakers to say as they wished and we tagged along sometimes laughing alongside them we took sides in the issues and we became subjective forgetting our professional tenants for objectivity and neutrality
985648 i hear it was sponsored by the party of national unity pnu
985649 the gist of it is that raila odinga is a murderer he is power hungry he doesnt care about other tribes he only cares about his tribe the luo community it says that luos are lazy they dont work they are hooligans that when they rent houses they dont pay rent
985650 you hear cases of lets reclaim our land lets reclaim our birthright lets claim our land means you want to evict people other ethnic communities from the place
985651 the announcers dont really have the ability to check what the callers are going to say
985652 people treat it as a big joke they dont know such stereotypes eventually get fixated in peoples minds when they begin to kill people its one of the triggers of violence in this country when we begin to dehumanize other kenyans and depict them as animals its easy to take a machete and hack them to death
985653 this vernacular radio station kameme fm should be banned because we have seen that ethnic radio stations can be misused to incite anarchy and genocide as happened in neighboring rwanda
985654 we must convey to owners and managers of vernacular radio stations that the content of hate broadcasts and the names of those responsible for putting them on the air are currently being recorded analyzed and preserved for use in future criminal prosecutions before domestic and international courts as well as the application of other penalties such as placement on watch lists freezing of overseas assets and severe limitations on visas and travel
985655 wal mart pressures the factory to cut its price and the factory responds with longer hours or lower pay and the workers have no options
985656 the supreme courts decision is very important because it recognises their the workers rights since 1998 despite their illegal residence status because they were with the same employer
985657 it recognises their rights since 1998 rather than 2001 because they were with the same employer after their residence was legalised in 2001 as they were before
985658 it recognises that all workers in our country immigrants employed in agriculture in this case should be remunerated like greeks employed in the same sector without any discrimination
985659 this ruling obliges employers in our country to completely adhere to rules regulating legal wages which means that those who do not pay economic migrants the national minimum legal wage will be breaking the law
985660 it is a very positive outcome and sends a strong message that we hope will encourage all migrant workers to seek redress from employers

985662 the way to his house is very dark he must have been taken and then brought to the place where he was killed
985663 in 1995 there were 150 households in our village we did not need help from the government because we had animals and fields but when the events started the clashes between the pkk and the army our village was emptied for security reasons in the spring of 2007 the governor and the district authorities gave us permission to work our fields we six families returned to the village and sowed wheat barley and planted vegetables had we been allowed to harvest we would have had enough to eat for the winter and we would not have been dependent on the state but because of an increase in clashes we have been evicted from our village and cannot harvest we have been told that security is the reason all our efforts have been wasted
985664 my brother previously told me that police officers were talking bout him each other we were in the village 3 days ago how can someone be a guerrilla in a day he was seen walking in bazaar at about 8pm and then he somehow went 60 km to plant mines after he was killed villagers went to take the body but they were threatened by pointing a gun against the head of the driver afterwards the governor announced that a militant was killed they did not allow us during the autopsy and they wrote an arbitrary report
985665 we were together at about 5 pm his uncle isa sakar was also with us and we spent some 2 hours at about 7pm he went home to fix something few hours later i heard he was killed possibly the official announcement does not reflect the the way to his house is very dark he must have been taken and then brought to the place where he was killed
985666 if he had been a militant his id could not have been identified at least for 3 days

985683 we are surprised that the treasury has risked provoking such political opposition for an environmental measure which according to its projections is of limited benefit
985684 when this was one of the main objectives of the changes
985685 even the projected differentials between ved bands remain too small to be effective
985686 we also believe that both the proposed changes in ved rates and the objectives of ved as an environmental tax have been poorly explained and communicated
985687 the changes to car tax announced in the budget are a step in the right direction
985688 raising the rates on high emissions cars that are already on the road could encourage sales of more efficient models in the second hand market
985689 meanwhile the first year rates being introduced for new cars will create a kind of showroom tax that could be used to influence buyers of new cars to choose the most efficient model in each class
985690 however the differentials between high and low carbon cars are still nothing like wide enough to make a big impact in practice
985691 according to the governments own figures these changes will only have a very limited impact on the environment
985692 the treasury must be more ambitious matching increased charges on high carbon cars with discounts or rebates on low emissions vehicles
985693 the treasury must also urgently work to ensure these changes are not unfair to vulnerable groups
985694 in all the treasury must do far better in communicating the details and benefits of its green tax policies
985695 making revenue neutral tax changes or explicitly hypothecating some of the revenue raised from green taxes towards spending on the environment would be more effective environmentally and more acceptable to the public
985696 a failure to advertise green tax details to the public or explain them in a timely manner to parliament breeds suspicion about their objectives increasing the perception of them as revenue raising measures with no environmental purpose
985697 until the financial and environmental impacts are properly assessed and a car scrappage scheme has been introduced
985698 if a notice is not paid it is essential it is followed up
985699 an army of municipal bin bullies hitting law abiding families with massive fines while professional criminals get the soft touch
985700 it is clear whitehall bureaucrats are instructing town halls to target householders with fines for minor breaches
985701 yet with the slow death of weekly collections and shrinking bins it is increasingly hard for families to dispose of their rubbish responsibly it is fundamentally unfair that householders are now getting hammered with larger fines than shoplifters get for stealing
985702 local authorities wanted flexible fines that they can relate to the severity and frequency of the offence and offender ultimately the fines are there to act as a deterrent
985703 a few hundred pounds for someone scratched during an operation
985704 they come to well under 1 of the nhs budget
985705 so the notion that claims are bleeding the nhs dry doesnt hold water
985706 its much more costly to prepare evidence to prove a claim than it is to assemble evidence to knock it down
985707 stop arguing admit fault and settle earlier without drawn out legal wrangling

985710 ships officers recorded air pressure wind strength air and sea temperature and other weather conditions from those records scientists can build a detailed picture of past weather and climate
985711 british archives contain more than 100 000 royal navy logbooks from around 1670 to 1850 alone they are a stunning resource
985712 it means we can deduce numerical values for wind strength and direction temperature and rainfall
985713 global warming is a reality but what our data shows is that climate science is complex and that it is wrong to take particular events and link them to co2 emissions these records will give us a much clearer picture of what is really happening
985714 it is not a finishing school nor is it conventional evening classes

985721 someone whose hard work and ability over the last 11 years has made britain better off
985722 thats why ive no doubt that gordon brown is the right person for the job
985723 i think gordon brown understands where the problems are coming from better than anybody in british politics and what we are going to do about them
985724 make a strong case why britain needs a labour government
985725 we have all got to recognise that if everything gets dominated by leadership speculation it gets in the way of getting labours message across
985726 we feel that it is consistent with the governments approach that it wants to listen and learn from the experiences of people in this country
985727 we will continue to work with the energy companies and others to make sure that we provide help including social tariffs for those groups
985728 they have spent hundreds of millions of pounds but the poorest children are still extremely unlikely to continue in education after gcses
985729 we need to get to the root causes of this inequality and it begins with the need to strengthen relationships and support families
985730 the low statistics being banded about today are based on young people staying on to do a levels or their equivalent and are therefore misleading
985731 emas have been a success in significantly increasing the staying on rate of young people
985732 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
985733 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
985734 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
985735 for all gordon browns talk of creating a fair society with opportunity for all the reality is very different
985736 a child from a deprived background is 193 times more likely to leave school without a single good gcse than they are to get three as at a level
985737 quantification of the effects of land use land cover lulc changes on proximal measurements of near surface air temperature is crucial to a better understanding of natural and anthropogenically induced climate change in this study data from stations utilized in deriving u s climatological temperature normals were analyzed in conjunction with ncep ncar 50 year reanalysis nnr estimates and highly accurate lulc change maps in order to isolate the effects of lulc change from other climatological factors while the normals temperatures exhibited considerable warming in both minima and maxima the nnr data revealed that the majority of the warming of maximum temperatures was not due to nearby lulc change warming of minimum temperatures was roughly evenly split between the effects of lulc change and other influences furthermore the effects of lulc change varied considerably depending upon the particular type of land cover conversion that occurred urbanization in particular was found to result in warming of minima and maxima while some lulc conversions that might be expected to have significantly altered nearby temperatures e g clear cutting of forests did not
985738 the usgs land cover trends project provides high accuracy lulc data that afford a unique opportunity for examining the effects of lulc on near surface air temperatures in examining minimum and maximum temperatures from u s climate normals stations near areas of lulc change it was found that post change minimum temperatures were warmer than those before the lulc change and often significantly so this was also true for maximum temperatures although the magnitude of the temperature difference was smaller and not all lulc conversion types resulted in warming examination of nnr data corresponding to these stations however revealed that about half the warming seen in the normals minimum temperatures and the majority of warming in the maximum temperatures was attributable to effects other than lulc change despite this minimum temperatures were found to be significantly warmer as a result of nearby lulc changes in general and for two specific types of change urbanization of forested land and urbanization of crop pastureland the latter of these conversion types also resulted in significant warming of maximum temperatures
985739 recent studies have confirmed the impacts of land surface processes on surface temperature trends we investigate this relationship over the conterminous united states conus by using the observation minus reanalysis omr approach we derive omr trends for the 1979 2003 period from two datasets the us historical climate network ushcn observations and the ncep ncar north american regional reanalysis narr we use the mean square differences msds for the comparisons between temperature anomalies from station observations both unadjusted and adjusted and interpolated reanalysis data trends of monthly mean temperature anomalies at individual station level and over the conus show the agreement between ushcn and narr and demonstrate that narr captures the climate variability at different time scales temperature anomalies exhibit a spatial variability with amplitudes increasing from south to north as a further evaluation of spatial patterns the rms differences also depict a good agreement over the eastern conus 0 29 c to 0 6 c omr trend results suggest that unlike findings from studies based on the global reanalysis narr often has a larger warming trend than observations but 10 year moving window trends reveal that this situation varies considerably over time from one station to another most of the warming accounts for large winter increases adjusted ushcn 0 46 c decade narr 0 5 c decade especially over the midwest in contrast other seasons in particular summer and fall exhibit low trends this difference in winter and other seasons trends is and can be considered as a prominent feature omr trends are sensitive to land cover types evergreen needleleaf forests open shrublands bare soils and urban areas exhibit the largest warming moreover the omr method captures the trend variability of land types that are subject to seasonality e g croplands deciduous forests overall the results obtained with the regional reanalysis are consistent with findings from global reanalysis r1 and era 40

985930 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
985931 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
985932 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
985933 we know so much about the harmful effects of exposure to violent media content but how much exposure children actually get has been largely ignored now were learning more about the large numbers of kids seeing this material and who they are
985934 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
985935 we should re think the current movie rating system which has been in place for 40 years and was designed when kids could only see movies in theaters ratings need to be more prominent on all movies whether they are seen in theaters or purchased in the store and we need clearer messages to parents pediatricians and child advocates should instruct parents to strictly abide by the movie age guidelines and to closely monitor movie viewing

985971 net negative impact of the exercise of a vulnerability considering both the probability and the impact of the occurrence
985972 two essential characteristics of risk are the probability of occurrence and the magnitude of the damage
985973 process of identifying risk assessing risk and taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level
985974 implement the most appropriate controls to decrease mission risk to an acceptable level with minimal adverse impact on the organizations resources and mission
985975 assess the business value of their information assets determine the likelihood they theyll be compromised and then tailor a set of risk abatement processes to particular vulnerabilities

985991 and although the pentagon prefers not to use experimental weapons on the battlefield
985992 a terrorist organization might have trouble putting a nuclear warhead on target with a scud but it would be much easier to simply launch and detonate in the atmosphere
985993 no need for the risk and difficulty of trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon over the border or hit a particular city just launch a cheap missile from a freighter in international waters al qaida is believed to own about 80 such vessels and make sure to get it a few miles in the air
985994 up until now i believed the nuclear threat to the u s from iran was limited to the ability of terrorists to penetrate the borders or port security to deliver a device to a major city
985995 while that threat should continue to be a grave concern for every american these tests by iran demonstrate just how devious the fanatical mullahs in tehran are we are facing a clever and unscrupulous adversary in iran that could bring america to its knees
985996 the europeans should tell us whether these ideas can work as the basis for continued negotiations or not
985997 if yes fine if not then the negotiations cannot continue
985998 an electromagnetic pulse emp attack on the american homeland said one of the distinguished scientists who testified at the hearing is one of only a few ways that the united states could be defeated by its enemies terrorist or otherwise
985999 and it is probably the easiest a single scud missile carrying a single nuclear weapon detonated at the appropriate altitude would interact with the earths atmosphere producing an electromagnetic pulse radiating down to the surface at the speed of light depending on the location and size of the blast the effect would be to knock out already stressed power grids and other electrical systems across much or even all of the continental united states for months if not years
986000 several potential adversaries have or can acquire the capability to attack the united states with a high altitude nuclear weapons generated electromagnetic pulse emp a determined adversary can achieve an emp attack capability without having a high level of sophistication
986001 emp is one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences
986002 emp will cover the wide geographic region within line of sight to the nuclear weapon it has the capability to produce significant damage to critical infrastructures and thus to the very fabric of u s society as well as to the ability of the united states and western nations to project influence and military power
986003 so pervasive in all aspects of our society and military coupled through critical infrastructures
986004 their effects on systems and infrastructures dependent on electricity and electronics could be sufficiently ruinous as to qualify as catastrophic to the nation
986005 briefly a single nuclear weapon exploded at high altitude above the united states will interact with the earths atmosphere ionosphere and magnetic field to produce an electromagnetic pulse emp radiation down to the earth and additionally create electrical currents in the earth
986006 emp effects are both direct and indirect the former are due to electrical systems and the latter arise from the damage that shocked upset damaged and destroyed electronics controls then inflict on the systems in which they are embedded the indirect effects can be even more severe than the direct effects
986007 what is different now is that some potential sources of emp threats are difficult to deter they can be terrorist groups that have no state identity have only one or a few weapons and are motivated to attack the u s without regard for their own safety
986008 rogue states such as north korea and iran may also be developing the capability to pose an emp threat to the united states and may also be unpredictable and difficult to deter
986009 few if any people would die right away but the loss of power would have a cascading effect on all aspects of u s society communication would be largely impossible lack of refrigeration would leave food rotting in warehouses exacerbated by a lack of transportation as those vehicles still working simply ran out of gas which is pumped with electricity the inability to sanitize and distribute water would quickly threaten public health not to mention the safety of anyone in the path of the inevitable fires which would rage unchecked and as we have seen in areas of natural and other disasters such circumstances often result in a fairly rapid breakdown of social order
986010 american society has grown so dependent on computer and other electrical systems that we have created our own achilles heel of vulnerability ironically much greater than those of other less developed nations
986011 when deprived of power we are in many ways helpless as the new york city blackout made clear in that case power was restored quickly because adjacent areas could provide help but a large scale burnout caused by a broad emp attack would create a much more difficult situation not only would there be nobody nearby to help it could take years to replace destroyed equipment
986012 but it will take leadership by the department of homeland security the defense department and other federal agencies along with support from congress all of which have yet to materialize
986013 the sept 11 commission report stated that our biggest failure was one of imagination no one imagined that terrorists would do what they did on sept 11 today few americans can conceive of the possibility that terrorists could bring our society to its knees by destroying everything we rely on that runs on electricity but this time weve been warned and wed better be prepared to respond
986014 the de facto national policy of nakedness to all of our potentially emp armed enemies takes on ever more the character of national scale masochism it is perverse irrational and assuredly not necessary or foreordained
986015 1 the electromagnetic radiation from a nuclear explosion caused by compton recoil electrons and photoelectrons from photons scattered in the materials of the nuclear device or in a surrounding medium the resulting electric and magnetic fields may couple with electrical electronic systems to produce damaging current and voltage surges may also be caused by non nuclear means 2 a broadband high intensity short duration burst of electromagnetic energy note in the case of a nuclear detonation the electromagnetic pulse consists of a continuous frequency spectrum most of the energy is distributed throughout the lower frequencies between 3 hz and 30 khz

986034 surely the question whether we should be working under peace conditions depends upon whether working under those conditions will give us the necessary deliveries of our munitions upon whether the gun plants and the shell plants and above all the airplane factories can fulfill the need in time if they can do so then peace conditions are no doubt very convenient but if not then we must substitute other conditions not necessarily war conditions but conditions which would impinge upon the ordinary daily life and business life of this country there are many conditions apart from war conditions preparatory conditions precautionary conditions emergency conditions and these must be established in this country if progress is to be made arliament and the nation are not to find themselves deluded in the future by which in the result will be found to be utterly unfulfilled

986058 we want every victim of the auction rate securities fraud to get as much of their money back as possible and arbitration is the only way it will happen

986082 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
986083 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
986084 though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
986085 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s

986092 the arrest of political leader datuk seri anwar ibrahim on july 16 is of great concern to us and the international community

986152 this carefully designed large randomized double blind placebo controlled trial powered to detect clinically important differences in functional performance shows that creatine supplementation does not significantly augment the training effect of pulmonary rehabilitation
986153 arguably the most complete study to date examining the comparative efficacy of creatine supplementation in conjunction with exercise
986154 the main mechanism of action of creatine being to allow subjects to train harder it may well be that patients with copd are unable to achieve that level of training despite being aided by creatine
986155 we have to appreciate that only a small portion of patients with copd actually engage in pulmonary rehabilitation

986207 in the same bitter winter of 1776 that gen george washington led his beleaguered troops across the delaware river to safety benjamin franklin sailed across the atlantic to paris to engage in an equally crucial campaign this one diplomatic a lot depended on the bespectacled and decidedly unfashionable 70 year old as he entered the worlds fashion capitol sporting a simple brown suit and a fur cap franklins miracle was that armed only with his canny personal charm and reputation as a scientist and philosopher he was able to cajole a wary french government into lending the fledgling american nation an enormous fortune the enduring image of franklin in paris tends to be that of a flirtatious old man too busy visiting the citys fashionable salons to pursue affairs of state as rigorously as john adams when adams joined franklin in paris in 1779 he was scandalized by the late hours and french lifestyle his colleague had adopted says stacy schiff in a great improvisation adams was clueless that it was through the dropped hints and seemingly offhand remarks at these salons that so much of french diplomacy was conducted like the beatles arriving in america franklin aroused fervor his face appeared on prints teacups and even chamber pots the extraordinary popularity served franklins diplomatic purposes splendidly not even king louis xvi could ignore the enthusiasm that had won over both the nobility and the bourgeoisie

986209 most managers spend a great deal of time thinking about what they plan to do but relatively little time thinking about what they plan not to do as a result they become so caught up in fighting the fires of the moment that they cannot really attend to the longterm threats and risks facing the organization so the first soft skill of leadership the hard way is to cultivate the perspective of marcus aurelius avoid busyness free up your time stay focused on what really matters let me put it bluntly every leader should routinely keep a substantial portion of his or her time i would say as much as 50 percent unscheduled only when you have substantial slop in your schedule unscheduled time will you have the space to reflect on what you are doing learn from experience and recover from your inevitable mistakes leaders without such free time end up tackling issues only when there is an immediate or visible problem managers typical response to my argument about free time is thats all well and good but there are things i have to do yet we waste so much time in unproductive activity it takes an enormous effort on the part of the leader to keep free time for the truly important things
986210 nearly every major decision of my business career was to some degree the result of daydreaming to be sure in every case i had to collect a lot of data do detailed analysis and make a data based argument to convince superiors colleagues and business partners but that all came later in the beginning there was the daydream by daydreaming i mean loose unstructured thinking with no particular goal in mind in fact i think daydreaming is a distinctive mode of cognition especially well suited to the complex fuzzy problems that characterize a more turbulent business environment daydreaming is an effective way of coping with complexity when a problem has a high degree of complexity the level of detail can be overwhelming the more one focuses on the details the more one risks being lost in them every child knows how to daydream but many perhaps most lose the capacity as they grow up

986252 when i was young like all the young art great art was my religion but with the years i came to see that art as it was understood until 1800 was henceforth finished on its last legs doomed and that so called artistic activity with all its abundance is only the many formed manifestation of its agony men are detached from and more and more disinterested in painting sculpture and poetry appearances to the contrary men today have put their hearts into everything else the machine scientific discoveries wealth the domination of natural forces and immense territories we no longer feel art as a vital need as a spiritual necessity as was the case in centuries past many of us continue to be artists and to be occupied with art for reasons which have little in common with true art but rather through a spirit of imitation through nostalgia for tradition through mere inertia through love of ostentation of prodigality of intellectual curiosity through fashion or through calculation they live still through force of habit and snobbery in a recent past but the great majority in all places no longer have any sincere passion for art which they consider at most as a diversion a hobby and a decoration little by little new generations with a predilection for mechanics and sports more sincere more cynical and brutal will leave art to the museums and libraries as an incomprehensible and useless relic of the past from the moment that art is no longer the sustenance that nourishes the best the artist may exteriorize his talent in all sorts of experiments with new formulas in endless caprices and fancy in all the expedients of intellectual charlatanism in the arts people no longer seek consolation nor exaltation but the refined the rich the indolent distillers of quintessence seek the new the unusual the original the extravagant the shocking and i since cubism and beyond i have satisfied these gentlemen and these critics with all the various whims which have entered my head and the less they understood them the more they admired by amusing myself at these games at all these tomfooleries at all these brain busters riddles and arabesques i became famous quite rapidly and celebrity means for a painter sales increment money wealth today as you know i am famous and very rich but when completely alone with myself i havent the nerve to consider myself an artist in the great and ancient sense of the word there have been great painters like giotto titian rembrandt and goya i am only a public entertainer who has understood his time this is a bitter confession mine more painful indeed than it may seem but it has the merit of being sincere

986736 here comes bream heres the throw to the plate he iiiiiiiisssssssss safe braves win braves win braves win braves win braves win
986737 you have our permission to turn off the tv and go to bed now as long as you promise to patronize our sponsors
986738 i got to talk to him yesterday and i told him i loved him and he started laughing because i was stuck in new york
986739 it was our own private little joke i at least got to tell him i loved him which was the last thing i said to him so im grateful for that
986740 there are no words sad doesnt do it justice i will always remember skip for his humor and his ability to go about life the way he did i gained so much respect for what he did and how long he did and how he did
986741 i figured skip caray is as much a part of atlanta braves baseball as any of us
986742 we all grew up listening to skip whether it be on tv or radio any time the guys on espn imitate you calling the highlights youre pretty much a legend from a fans standpoint hes going to be a huge loss for them because he relayed the games to fans for so long
986743 he always made a note to come by my locker and shake my hand ask me how i was doing how the family was how my kids were
986744 personally over the last 15 16 17 years i havent gotten his play by play on the radio or tv but i had a lot of plane flight conversations with him i really respected him as well as the whole caray family they have a pretty good legacy working over there its a sad day for braves baseball
986745 this was completely unexpected and is a complete loss i had just spoken with skip this week when we did the radio show and i didnt know he wasnt feeling well he seemed in his normal good spirits weve all lost a very good friend for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
986746 but behind the humor there was an honesty and a commitment to telling it like he believed it to be that never ever varied
986747 if he didnt like it that a game was two minutes late getting started everybody knew about it if he had an opinion on a player he said it and he had a way of saying it that was sometimes humorous the way he could take a bad ball game in some of those bad years especially and turn it into a fun broadcast whether it was by talking about something in the game or whether it was talking about something that didnt have anything to do with the game maybe it was a movie that was coming up after the game or maybe it was a restaurant that hed gone to it could have been anything he was just a very entertaining broadcaster and a very good one the game was still the most important thing but if game was decided by the fourth or fifth inning people would still watch the rest of the game just to hear what he had to say about things thats a very very unique ability
986748 i knew that he had been battling some health issues but i was just really shocked and saddened when i got the e mail
986749 and i was grateful for the many years i was able to be with skip from 1976 until 1990 skip saw the funny side of things and enjoyed making people laugh when we werent giving them too much to smile about during some of those years that i was with the braves

986772 am i saying that we will have to do the same or more with less unfortunately the straight answer to that question is yes having fewer people however should not be a reason to offer poor customer service or shirk our public service journalism responsibility in fact it is imperative that we do the opposite

986812 in my opinion however the actions of the commonwealth were properly incidental to preventing the rescuees from landing in australian territory where they had no right to go their inability to go elsewhere derived from circumstances which did not come from any action on the part of the commonwealth the presence of sas troops on board the mv tampa did not itself or in combination with other factors constitute a detention
986813 the counsel and solicitors acting in the interests of the rescuees in this case have evidently done so pro bono they have acted according to the highest ideals of the law they have sought to give voices to those who are perforce voiceless and on their behalf to hold the executive accountable for the lawfulness of its actions in so doing even if ultimately unsuccessful in the litigation they have served the rule of law and so the whole community

986924 come november colorado will be ground zero for the pro life movement
986925 me and a lot of my friends want to do what we can to create a culture of life
986926 the ban has very real consequences that fall into three main categories denial of access to life or health saving abortion services denial or delay in access to other obstetric emergency care and a pronounced fear of seeking treatment for obstetrical emergencies the net result has been avoidable deaths
986927 to make a woman who knows that she has an anacephalic child in her womb carry it to term and make her suffer though giving birth a patient who sees her child born with those problems suffers devastating psychological consequences
986928 what we normally do when there are malformations incompatible with life is to terminate the pregnancy when we detect it but now according to the law it cannot be done we have encountered various cases of young girls whose pregnancies we could not terminate so we told her that she has a pregnancy that the baby is not going to live and that it will die when it is born but we can only explain there is nothing we can do
986929 there were countless couples who got up and told their story about how they had to have an abortion because of a child that was anacephalic or deformed in some terrible way
986930 it didnt move these people at all they didnt care they just didnt care it didnt matter if the woman was raped it didnt matter if it was incest it didnt matter if the girl was under age
986931 if the child is not going to survive its bad enough that the womans having to carry this inside of her
986932 knowing what women go through to have this wonderful event occur only to be told that youve got a child thats not going to survive birth and then to think that you have to carry that child go through the pain of the delivery process and then watch it die
986933 first of all any form of hormonal contraception would be considered criminal the family planning person would be considered a criminal because you are killing potentially a person because the embryo is not being allowed to implant there are so many aspects of this that are just horrific
986934 what theyre asking people to do is pass laws saying that these fertilized eggs are equal to a woman in every way
986935 heres the key element that theyre forgetting from my perspective hey those embryos still need a uterus no uterus no baby
986936 you have to deal with those little embryos in the deep freeze if youre an in vitro fertilization center what do you do with them if the couple doesnt want to use them
986937 are you going to assign them to the state are you going to give them up for adoption and therefore the couple loses their rights to utilize them or dispose of them in whatever way they want
986938 those are decisions that are very difficult to make but should be made by the couple not by the government
986939 when the government gets involved in those decisions we are stepping into a huge mess
986940 i told the subcommittee that according to the referendum that would constitute a small city i asked if my small city gets voting rights if i put them in my car do i get to ride in the hov lane there are so many offshoots of this that are so illogical its just insane
986941 just like a woman has a right to decide what happens inside her body a couple has a right to use science to have children
986942 its unbelievable that any movement like this could get any traction
986943 to defend and protect christians and their religious beliefs in the public square
986944 to promote and defend the sanctity of life and family around the world according to the teachings of the roman catholic church through prayer service and education
986945 little girls do not grow up dreaming of hopping from bed to bed and contraception
986946 they dream of a man who will sweep them off their feet and love them forever and having his many children
986947 the fact that you have colorado right to life that was kicked out of national right to life because of their pursuit of this and because of other extreme actions is fascinating clearly this exposes a real dog fight that the right wing is having within their own movement about the efficacy of these measures
986948 theyve used the ballot measures but not extremely successfully to take their issues directly to the people

986950 when you go beyond what are intended to be polarized debates around abortion to the point of implicating womens health and rolling back birth control access and allowing the state to investigate miscarriages its not the wisest move especially in a western state where women and voters have a sense of the proper role of government

986981 the artisan radar is a sophisticated world class system which will significantly improve the flow and quality of information to commanders compared with existing technology
986982 the new radar will replace existing systems on our type23 frigates landing ships hms albion and hms bulwark and the assault helicopter carrier hms ocean as well as on our two new aircraft carriers hms queen elizabeth and hms prince of wales this is a prime example of the type of hi tech equipment that we are investing in to improve the ability of our commanders to operate in the 21st century
986983 the mrr project will provide the royal navy with a long awaited and unrivalled improvement to its medium range radar capability whilst also delivering enhanced system availability and best value for money to the taxpayer
986984 the project will be delivered through a firm price contract covering both demonstration manufacture and delivery of the radar systems and the first 10 years of in service support this has been a tight competition and my thanks go to all those in industry and in the mod who have worked so hard to make this happen

987004 students in this region are becoming more and more technologically advanced and as a result they are adjusting their study habits to fit in with their more digitally focused lifestyles
987005 a new generation of students expects a learning environment that integrates todays digital tools accommodates a mobile lifestyle adapts to individual learning styles and encourages collaboration and teamwork
987006 at this stage only apple product and solutions provide all the resources that educators need to create a twenty first century learning environment with reliable cost effective hardware built in digital authoring tools basic skills solutions distribution access and management products including professional development tools
987007 the students of today will be the decision makers of tomorrow we recognize the importance of technological support for the education market in this region and are excited to be a part of its development and expansion
987008 urging educational institutions and individuals to adopt apple early on eventually the graduating students will be demanding and using apple hardware and software products in their jobs
987009 it reinforces the idea that were seeing a steady but not dramatic decline in employment which is likely to last for some time
987010 i put in the full url to the images folder and that seems to have fixed the issue
987011 well tell you what you need to know when you need to know it and youll like it

987020 the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomisation of the query id and the source port essentially making it all the more difficult to spoof the dns response
987021 however it appears that apple forgot something the client libraries on my os x 10 4 11 system post patch install still does not randomise the source port
987022 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
987023 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
987024 in these cases the network device performing pat port address translation uses a predictable source port allocation policy such as incremental allocation when performing the layer 4 rewrite operation that is necessary for pat

987029 now that the technical details of many of these techniques have been brought to a high level the focus should now properly be on what the data obtained from these increasingly mature technologies have to say specifically about vision and more generally about brain function
987030 it is great if you like to run but dont run everyday try biking or swimming some days do some different things that way you are giving your muscles a rest and using them in different ways
987031 one of the things to do is get a workout buddy because if that person is there and waiting for you to exercise youre less likely to blow things off
987032 when you are watching the olympics there are commercials go outside have a little bit of a walk do a few crunches keep moving as much as you can because it all makes a difference
987033 parents need to get out there and have fun because the kids will see their parents doing it and theyll want to join in
987034 definitely set some family time aside each week so that you can go bike riding play tennis or even go on a walk as long as youre doing it together its not only family time its fun
987035 you dont have to be an olympic athlete to see the benefits of exercise
987036 three times of exercise a week to start and more as you progress will give you huge benefits
987037 when children consume a high fat high sugar meal their bodies will crash and they will be come very tired and lethargic which is not going to help them perform at their best level in school
987038 when you are grocery shopping keep in mind that if a snack is in the home your children will likely eat it so keep healthy food in the house at all times to ensure that they will always have healthy snack options if you keep candy bars and fruit in the home most children would pick the candy bar so just keep it out of the house
987039 a smart dinner will help your childs brain function if they are satisfied after dinnertime then they will sleep through the night and a child needs at least eight to nine hours of sleep a night in order to function while in school the next day
987040 childhood is a crucial time when bodies are growing and brains are developing
987041 its so important to fuel the body with good nutrition and teaching children smart eating habits at a young age is a great idea it starts with the parents serving as the role model
987042 discrimination against people who are hiv positive runs rampant as the population living with hiv grows we need to ensure they live lives with the full array of rights and dignities all individuals deserve
987043 with millions gaining access to life saving drugs and treatment the battle against aids enters a critical phase we must address the long term deeply entrenched social challenges that stand in the way of people living full and productive lives with the disease
987044 this means confronting head on the discrimination and lack of opportunity that made so many vulnerable to the disease in the first place
987045 if we are to deliver improved warnings of severe weather we need improvements of this sort to our observations network
987046 the new weather radar will provide detailed information and help us better plan and prioritise flood alleviation work
987047 if the fiscal policy response remained inadequate amidst heightened external shocks or resulted in an intensification of domestic inflation then ratings pressure for a change in indias sovereign ratings outlook from stable to negative would increase
987048 policy as well as market interest rates could rise and a sharp deceleration in growth may follow
987049 by limiting indias dependence on imported hydrocarbons and strengthening as well as diversifying its power generation capabilities the nuclear deal could offer medium term support to the ratings
987050 will be weighed against more imminent challenges that are derived from external shocks and lack or a more prudent flexible and resilient fiscal framework

987055 there were also high levels of poverty in the area after the conflict
987056 this system enabled the beneficiaries to get easy access to the cash and they could buy necessary food immediately
987057 we thought the best way of getting effective aid to these people was cash
987058 if the markets work there is no point in us buying goods taking them to the area and distributing them we might not get the type of goods required right and there are also issues to do with trucking food cash made much more sense
987059 these people are mobile so they can go wherever they can get cheap food and the mobiles reduced their isolation
987060 if there is money the food will come merchants will come people suffer because they cant buy
987061 we found that one mobile phone per large group of people is not enough we will need to get more phones
987062 most of the projects that have used the mobile phone technology have been small in scale and preliminary probably due the high costs of developing and deploying mobile technologies
987063 provided the difference between wholesale and retail prices is within a certain range local food markets are actually functioning and that the cash transfer programme is long enough to justify the costs of the equipment phones chargers etc

987065 mengo is not above the law the seventh parliament passed the issue of the regional tier and it could have been implemented a long time ago but it is the mengo government which has delayed it
987066 since the issue is in the constitution we shall not allow mengo to derail it i am going to sit with the omukama iguru bunyoro king the nrm caucus and cabinet and see how it can start working in the areas where they want it
987067 this is not the first time they are disturbing even in 1961 they disturbed they fear elections but we shall allow the regional tier system to start working in areas where they want it so that kingdom leaders can be elected by the people
987068 i am happy that the bunyoro deputy prime minister seems to be a strong movementist because he was talking in the movement language and told me that in bunyoro kingdom they do not tolerate corruption

987084 the compactrio embedded system and labview graphical tools from national instruments gave us the power to design prototype and deploy the control system within our visica2 medical device quickly and beat our time to market goals while saving money by eliminating the need for building custom hardware the rio architecture and new low cost hardware help us even further by allowing us to quickly move to lower cost hardware when deploying our machines at high volume without having to redesign software or start over from scratch with a new design
987085 we were able to rapidly prototype our system for fedex using labview and compactrio and create a final deployed solution with ni single board rio all in under a year the fact that ni provides hardware and software to quickly prototype and deploy embedded systems was crucial for us were quite sure we wouldnt have been able to hit our aggressive deadlines without ni tools

987143 mukhriz may have overplayed his hand he was right to tap into the anti pak lah sentiment but there is also fatigue in the party people want to move on and the general view is that the transition plan helps us to move on and concentrate on fighting the opposition

987566 obama is cherry picking here the corporate tax rate reduction would apply to all corporations yes exxon mobil but also to wal mart general motors and home depot to name a few of the other fortune 50 biggies even everybodys favorite starbucks would get the same tax break obamas statement is technically true but singling out oil companies suggests mccain has targeted oil companies for tax breaks he hasnt we rate obamas statement and the claim in the ad barely true
987567 a lower corporate tax rate is essential to keeping good jobs in the united states america was once a low tax business environment but as our trade partners lowered their rates america failed to keep pace we now have the second highest corporate tax rate in the world making america a less attractive place for companies to do business american workers deserve the chance to make fine products here and sell them around the globe
987568 proposed a cut in the corporate tax rate for all u s companies
987569 mccains economic plan includes a proposed cut in the corporate tax rate for all u s companies not just oil companies
987570 sen obamas nod to lowering corporate taxes comes as republicans have been attacking him for proposals that would raise the cost of doing business such as his pledge to raise the tax rate on capital gains and his vow to increase the top income tax rates which are often used by small unincorporated enterprises he didnt say how deeply he would cut the rate but said it could be trimmed in return for reducing corporate tax breaks simplifying the tax system
987571 the conference agreement provides for 14 6 billion in tax breaks and credits between 2005 and 2015 including 2 8 billion for fossil fuel production
987572 this bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country the handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for people of arizona i cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency security and energy independence
987573 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
987574 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
987575 from 1980 to 1988 the wpt may have reduced domestic oil production anywhere from 1 2 to 8 0 320 to 1 269 million barrels dependence on imported oil grew from between 3 and 13
987576 the crude oil windfall profit tax of the 1980s implications for current energy policy
987577 the wpt had the effect of reducing the domestic supply of crude oil below what the supply would have been without the tax this increased the demand for imported oil and made the united states more dependent upon foreign oil as compared with dependence without a wpt
987578 the crude oil windfall profit tax of the 1980s implications for current energy policy
987579 skeptics who want to check the data need to search no further than the eight year 1980s run of the energy industry windfall profit tax during that time domestic oil output fell to its lowest level in two decades
987580 the last time congress imposed a form of the windfall tax was the final gloomy days of jimmy carter and the result was a substantial reduction in domestic oil production about 5 thus raising the price of gas at the pump and a 10 increase in u s reliance on foreign oil a windfall profits tax is the ultimate act of economic masochism because it taxes only domestic production while imports and foreign oil subsidiaries bear almost none of the cost
987581 the track record for punitive measures like the windfall profits tax shows that they usually harm consumers along with the targeted industry in the end the tax hurt consumers more through higher energy prices than it helped them through higher tax revenues which turned out to be far lower than originally predicted because the tax discouraged production
987582 raising taxes on oil companies is no way to reduce gas prices
987583 john breaux you are from the oil patch how do you feel about your candidate talking about a windfall profits tax
987584 well a windfall profits tax is not going to produce a single barrel of oil when we had a windfall profits tax back in the 1980s we produced less energy than before we had the tax a windfall profits tax may make you feel good as a punitive measure against the energy companies but until we get the guys and women who produce the energy working with those that consume it we are never going to solve the problem a windfall profits tax will produce less energy and not more
987585 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
987586 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
987587 the demagogue is one who preaches doctrines he knows to be untrue to men he knows to be idiots
987588 i think with that record it was a one off experience
987589 i cannot really remember why probably a mixture of doing it on a budget and having a deadline again i am not sure why we had already put a compilation of singles that year so if i had been managing the band id have told us to go on holiday for a few months i think it was self imposed there was a lot of attention on glasgow at that time and maybe in hindsight we just realised it was our moment
987590 the original idea was suggested by paul savage who recorded the album
987591 thats why it took a little while we had to go through a lot of old things there were a couple of old unreleased things some bootlegs some live recordings we wanted to find a good live version of mogwai fear satan from around the same time but discovered that we didnt manage to play one of those until 2000
987592 much of what i remember was just traveling playing and listening to music
987593 it made the top 75 and sold 10 000 copies at that time we couldnt get our heads round that that was the equivalent of the secc or something it was good for us because it gave us a platform to go on and make more records
987594 there was one particular part that i dug him up about where he says that you can convince any indie muppet that you are a great guy by telling them how much you love marquee moon he tried that one on us but i know john loves music and it was probably true but he probably had a list of ten albums which he would use depending on what type of person he was trying to impress
987595 and not just to spend on ourselves but we had money to make records what we ended up doing which was a catastrophically stupid thing to do was spend a fortune making our third album even around that time there people around us who kept telling us how big we were going to be how we would be playing arenas and all that but i think we were always quite self contained we knew our limits in our heads playing the same places that sonic youth play was a massive success
987596 our accountant has asked us why we run a record label in the past we never set out with any massive goal of making any money which is good because we havent sometimes you get a wee surprise the last part chimp album did really well something that we have never really had before and we had a bit of help errors got some money for recording and we got some money from the music futures fund it was only really handful of labels where you believe in everything that they do maybe like creation in the early nineties and you cannot live without them but part of the motivation behind setting up a label was remembering what labels like wurlitzer jukebox love train and chemikal underground were doing around the time we started
987597 you should have seen what happened yesterday just up roncesvalles
987598 some people called 911 after they found me sleeping on a bench up there then the firetruck came to save me but im telling you i was so out i never even heard the siren or anything

987657 as part of our plans to modernise the centre we asked the local community for their input and many of them suggested that a computer facility would be a great asset

987660 they have spent hundreds of millions of pounds but the poorest children are still extremely unlikely to continue in education after gcses
987661 we need to get to the root causes of this inequality and it begins with the need to strengthen relationships and support families
987662 the low statistics being banded about today are based on young people staying on to do a levels or their equivalent and are therefore misleading
987663 emas have been a success in significantly increasing the staying on rate of young people
987664 a report this april by the institute of fiscal studies showed 18 500 extra young people stayed on in education in its first year of operation with a 6 increase in young people post 16 plus catching up with their gcses or their equivalent
987665 what we have seen is children in the most disadvantaged circumstances falling behind
987666 if you are a pupil eligible for free school meals you are 200 times more likely to leave school without a single effective gcse pass than you are to get three as at a level

987668 the gap is narrowing policies like sure start the ema are working
987669 the low figures being quoted today are totally misleading and refer only to a tiny group of ema students who go on to do a levels in a school sixth form and claim free school meals
987670 it totally ignores those who go to college do other qualifications do not claim free school meals or re take their gcses

987714 it may come as a surprise to some but the top 10 iyp headings mirror the top 10 print yellow pages headings typically because these headings drive so many on and offline queries it is not until we drill down beyond the top headings where differences emerge among print and internet local search behavior
987715 these differences can be attributed to differences in consumers local search needs for product vs service oriented information and long term vs short term purchase plans
987716 online usage through iyp and local search is growing and as we improve these products by helping more service oriented businesses get online and more product oriented businesses add online inventories this number will increase

987730 the creation of such an informed citizenry is the medias province

987764 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women see todays new ad and this from yesterday presumably a la harold ford 2006 this will be one of those strategies that will be a matter of deep dispute during the campaign and later treated as transparent and obvious once the campaign is concluded

987766 i think the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it but its the subtext of this campaign everybody knows that there are certain kinds of signals as a native of the south i can tell you when you see this charlton heston ad the one thats code for hes uppity he ought to stay in his place everybody gets that who is from a southern background we all understand that when mccain comes out and starts talking about affirmative action im against quotas we get what thats about

987775 ham radio is an old world technology having been around since the beginning of the 20th century radio amateurs pioneered the art and skill of wireless communication to the benefit of commercial broadcasters the military and for that matter all of mankind and then at some point we rested from our pioneering labor and simply enjoyed the fruits of our handiwork these days were mostly a bunch of dinosaurs set in our ways and convinced that our kind of radio communication remains relevant in a more modern age we love to point to newspaper and magazine articles about some ham saving the day during an emergency but the truth is that ham radio is an aging hobby facing an imminent and rapid decline i freely admit that because my head trumps my heart but the fact that were destined for the trash heap of history doesnt mean that we must go quietly in the night in the coming decade there will be significantly fewer of us with each passing year but weve yet to reach the end in whats an amazing story of human invention while we have one or two chapters remaining before penning the epilogue i intend to continue writing and speaking about the things that we have done and those things we continue to do our hobby is a strange mixture of technical and social issues and i dont feel the least bit constrained in commenting about things not directly related i toss in book movie and music reviews recipes pictures of totally unrelated subject material and all kinds of off topic chatter much to the consternation of the serious minded i consider my blog to be a lot like tuning 40 meters on a crisp cool saturday morning anything and everything is open for discussion where politics and religion are generally considered taboo over the air here on the web we have no such limitations in freely discussing such matters calling cq blog
987776 a great reminder why you will not find non amateur radio posts often here rather i put my musical interest material in the saxconspiracy blog and my world view amp political postings in the randomhold blog links are to the right on the sidebar

987836 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
987837 its a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
987838 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul collingwood and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
987839 my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring the team is properly prepared and plays to its full potential starting on thursday
987840 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
987841 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure that he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
987842 kids of my age are studying right now my friends are doing school work and i should be too but im here and it feels great
987843 to be competing at 14 is truly surprising and i feel great pride to be representing mexico
987844 its not a very common sport its one that involves a lot of concentration its quite elegant its a very pretty sport
987845 i get on really well with my team mates its like a family
987846 the main reason for that is the farming economy continues to do well in fact most commodities whether or not theyre agricultural or mining or heavy industry related things are doing exceptionally well
987847 ive known paul for years i lost weight last year the old fashioned way by dieting and living off protein shakes but it was hard to stay disciplined hes brilliant and is totally responsible for me staying so skinny

987852 so i prefer that it is ephemeral in small touches
987853 i prefer that the light comes from the ground up
987854 but to have a very contemporary space that isnt very parisian looking at all once youre inside you could be in california
987855 so in the evenings i need a break from drawings to give myself a bit of serenity and calm plus to me there is so much visual pollution out there that im not always happy about so home should be a refuge from all that
987856 everything is very organized but when you open the cupboards you can see its sometimes a bit of a mess inside kind of like me
987857 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
987858 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
987859 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
987860 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
987861 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
987862 maybe i am 70 percent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others
987863 for a country to have a great writer is like having another government thats why no regime has ever loved great writers only minor ones

987874 unsurprisingly sale and rent back continues to be a controversial issue
987875 far from being an alternative to the many equity release products aimed at older people sale and rent back offers flexible tenure for those can no longer afford the costs of home ownership
987876 for some becoming tenants will be a temporary stop gap while they get their finances back in order for others they will reap the benefits including cost of living in rental accommodation
987877 the draft code should be seen as a work in progress

987891 this is exactly what i feared about coming to madras nosy neighbours more interested in what is happening next door than their own homes
987892 i told raghu not to move to madras i have never lived in the city and i do not want to do so all that i have heard about the place and people the humid weather the insular society and inquisitive extended family members circle does not appeal to me at all please let us stay in bombay

987906 perhaps im the longest living patient of sle in india
987907 lupus patients now have a 70 20 year survival this is a major improvement over the 50 five year survival observed 30 years ago the good news is that lupus patients die less frequently now the bad news is that they still die at three times the rate of the general population lupus patients are also less sick at presentation have less damage and have lower levels of disease activity
987908 oh my god i might end up with this man woman after a few year
987909 our in field hospice team became much more efficient by using the ncp secure entry client rather than have to drive paperwork into the hospital and manually enter hippa regulated patient data they can instantly connect to our network from their handheld devices and securely upload anything they need to
987910 the interoperability of the vpn client was very important for us since we have a wide range of network technologies in place ncp allowed us to keep everything intact
987911 hill country memorial hospital had an interesting problem a built in ssl vpn connection on their windows mobile handhelds that allowed secure email however their core patient recordkeeping application was too difficult to manage on every device over the ssl
987912 adding an ipsec vpn connection allowed total protection for all applications and a much more flexible system for future growth
987913 the resistance is now stronger than before and this keeps the option of war awake if we were weak israel would not hesitate to start another war
987914 we are stronger than before and when hizbollah is strong our strength stops israel from starting a new war we dont seek war but we must be ready
987915 we are proud of our friendship with iran and with syria and every country which helps us to gain our rights
987916 all parties in lebanon are getting weapons no one asks from where
987917 i doubt that israel will attack iran because they know the consequences
987918 israel didnt achieve any of its goals the known goal of israel
987919 for fear it will harm pollards own good and israels efforts to assist him
987920 the state is throwing sand in the publics eyes and is shamelessly lying to the court when it claims it financially supports pollard and his wife the state cannot go on deceiving the public by making it believe that it does anything for pollard not only did the state abandon pollard for 23 years it also has the audacity to lie about it if the state ever gave one shekel to pollard or his wife let it prove it we know the truth and it will come to light in the courtroom
987921 this week it is jonathans 54th birthday had the state of israel made the slightest effort jonathan would be here celebrating his birthday at home in jerusalem instead he is celebrating by being forced to sue the state of israel to try to stop the campaign of lies it is waging against him
987922 the state of israel supports and assists jonathan pollard and his close associates in every possible respect
987923 the government of israel tried to atone for their embarrassment with money money to the lawyers money to the first wife anne money to the second wife esther according to government officials anne pollard received up to 2004 a cumulative sum amounting to 2 750 000 dollars and that was back when the dollar was still hard currency they refuse to reveal the amount which has been transferred to jonathan pollard and his current wife but they stress that the sums are astronomically large
987924 mrs pollard i e the current wife of the plaintiff claims that the government of israel is not giving her enough money
987925 the former cabinet secretary yisrael maimon opened the accounting books for orlev i e mk zevulun orlev head of the knesset state control committee and the sums of money ie that were allegedly given to the plaintiff and his wife were extremely impressive
987926 the state of israel has in the past given money to the former wife of the plaintiff money has been given as well to the current wife of the plaintiff as reimbursement for various expenses the state has also paid for the legal representation of the plaintiff additionally the state has provided funds for the personal needs of the plaintiff it should be made clear that helping the plaintiff even financially was deemed appropriate in the past and still stands
987927 there is no disagreement about the fact that the plaintiff worked in the service of the state of israel with this as background so the defendant informs us the plaintiff receives money from the state
987928 pollards bank account in israel is enriched every month by a deposit of triple the amount of his last salary during the time he was active as an agent linked to the foreign currency rate of exchange of the dollar and the cost of living index
987929 the information which was published regarding a bank account in israel for
987930 nevertheless the state has informed the high court of justice in response to a petition submitted by mr pollard that it will not evade its responsibilities to take care of pollard when he is released from prison
987931 in order to assist jonathan pollard and his close associates
987932 the government of israel worked very hard for mr pollard in various ways
987933 the state provided funds for mr pollard for his personal needs and for the needs of his current wife mrs esther pollard
987934 for reasons of sensitivity and out of a desire not to harm the issue itself

987959 you lived half of your life in kadma jamshedpur instead of becoming an engineer in the tata establishment you went away northwest to new delhi why
987960 i felt that when the whole life itself is an unread script and acting in one would be fun
987961 from what i hear after graduating from nsd you didnt exactly set mavlankar shree ram and all those joints in new delhis theatre circuit on fire
987962 i couldnt overact ratna from the beginning i think i was made for cinema
987963 i understand that you got your big break after working in a television commercial and pardon me for asking you werent your clothes borrowed
987964 and it was you who brought me home saying i should double up as your guinea pig
987965 and tenants are not supposed to be honorary tasters or models those are supposed to be paying jobs
987966 there are times when i doubt whether there is anything womanly in you at all your language is filthier than what flows in the mahim creek and fouls the entire arabian sea
987967 wear the leather jacket ride the bike carefully with the helmet on and hopefully break a leg before the first shot
987968 i am off will be back with the jacket in time for your dress trial in the producers office in famous studios at mahalakshmi in the afternoon you bloody shrew
987969 would you be so kind to share with our audience the story of your break nasseer
987970 he is having his fourth cold black coffee of the morning sir
987971 you know how it is sir ad agencies pay us a pittance but splurge on models because they sell the product
987972 the truth sir is worse the agencys creative head and the model are homosexual partners
987973 it is a scotch whiskey liqueur flavoured with heather honey and a variety of spices herbs including anise nutmeg and saffron whose blend is only known to its makers produced in broxburn scotland it sometimes is an ingredient in a cocktail called rusty nail but it has other uses in scotland people take it in a specially made snifter sometimes after briefly lighting the drink and closing the mouth of the container with the palm for a second or so the lack of oxygen extinguishes the flame and leaves a strange tangy taste around the rim which discerning drinkers like when they quaff it in one gulp there is however something about it that will interest you more pick up an ordinary balloon brandy glass available anywhere in india pour some 5 ml of the drambuie and light it with a matchstick give it three seconds to burn and close its mouth with your palm the flame will be off within two seconds and will not hurt you in the least as soon as the vacuum tugs your hand take it off and sniff the bubble its high is better than most drugs accord and what is more it is healthier
987974 exactly 26 and it took some 40 minutes and then the assistant director reminded the director that he had another shoot in the evening on a set erected inside the film city the male model still wasnt sober even after eleven cold coffees
987975 i read somewhere in that commercial you draped your jacket on a female co star
987976 the shot in the morning was supposed to be taking place in the french riviera but the agency was cutting costs with stock shots according to the storyboard a mulatto woman finds it chilly and shivers since the models jacket didnt fit me and the director liked the one i was wearing the shooting was completed like clockwork with my costume featuring me as the lead and the jacket was returned to my landlady in time for her assignment
987977 but it was another commercial that got you your movie break
987978 it was a funny thing you know in real life the mulatto woman made a play for me i politely but firmly turned her down collected my pay and was about to rush off when the director who wanted the babe noticed my brushing her off asked me to come in the evening if i had another nice jacket because it was a similar sort of script
987979 a similar commercial was shot by the same director the same day for the same agency and you figured in both
987980 it was not the same agency but the freelance scriptwriter was common to both in the evening i was to play a male cabin crew member in a foreign budget airline who lovingly drapes his jacket over the knees of an economy class female passenger as the blanket isnt adequate to cover her completely the concept received rave reviews in germany where the airline was based and that prepared the take off stage for my international movie career
987981 despite almost twenty one years in hollywood you have no american accent what is even better you still pronounce the r gutturally
987982 my money however lives in various countries and currencies roughly thirty percent of my income comes from playing the currency markets what is more euros are appreciating better
987983 i dont know about these things and my auditors do my tax planning
987984 you may not mind smoking in public nasseer but this channel runs a campaign against tobacco please refrain from smoking when we go on air

987988 a million things can go wrong with unattached females be it hollywood or bollywood if you have doubts ask the international sex symbol pamela anderson or read the biographies of late hindi actresses meena kumari parveen babi and hollywood great rock hudson
987989 you mean you ask those who give you company to undergo a medical test
987990 you dont need to get married to have children why marry and spoil the party
987991 i understand that your parents continue to live in jamshedpur despite the fact that you are their only male child
987992 i will answer this personal question as well on the one hand i do not want my old fashioned parents to cramp up my personal life and on the other they are happy here but they also visit me whener it is okay by them
987993 the personal segment is over nasseer after this break we will keep the questions to your profession interesting anecdotes and so on i am sorry if i offended you
987994 when one admits these things before a camera for the first time it gives a scare the tabloids and glossy mags here are going to skin me alive
987995 mumtaz has remained single without informing her of the purpose the popular channel offered to fly her to india under the guise of an interview and she has agreed to come next friday we do hope nasseer will delay his return to the us and the two friends will chat with us live next week till then it is goodbye from ratna sawhney have a nice evening and a good weekend

988016 when health care providers tell patients to watch their carbs eat more fiber or to avoid saturated fats most people dont know where to start
988017 myfoodadvisor takes the guesswork out of that this tool appeals to so many looking for nutrition information people with diabetes because of the consistent portions of carbohydrates and proteins people with or at risk for heart disease because of the option to search by fiber sodium and saturated fats and people with kidney disease because potassium and phosphorous information is included which is not listed on standard nutrition labels
988018 sometimes the low fat version of our favorite foods contains more sugar or sodium than the regular version or the sugar free contains more trans and saturated fat
988019 it is a good idea to have the total picture before making a decision at the grocery store
988020 lets say for example you are trying to watch the amount of carbohydrates you eat but also trying to increase your fiber intake
988021 you can search for recipes that meet both of those needs
988022 if one person in the family has type 2 diabetes or heart disease chances are there are others around the dinner table who could be at risk as well
988023 myfoodadvisor can help to implement healthier food choices for the entire family

988027 first defense sales continue to be seasonal with lower sales expected during the second and third quarters
988028 our net loss reflects our strategic decision to make a significant and controlled investment in the development of mast out which entered into its pivotal effectiveness trial during the second quarter
988029 we consider this rate very attractive as it secures substantial revenues for two years starting from april 2009 up to and including the first quarter of 2011 at a strong average period daily rate of approximately 63 000 less 1 25 total commission there is rather limited advantage for the company to keep this vessel open in pursuit of a further possible spot market upside the nine months forward delivery date and the low commission structure are results of our efforts and ability to develop direct business with the industrys major charterers
988030 we are pleased that in this difficult financial environment we were able to complete our offering the proceeds will help us continue to fuel our marketing efforts and increase our growth in china we will be announcing our interim financial results for the fourth quarter in august and final results are planned for the second half of september we anticipate that those results will reflect continued progress on our expanding revenue base and sustained reductions in our fixed overhead structure as well as our variable costs
988031 i want to thank our employees and suppliers who have been very supportive as we have executed and implemented our new business model our organization has been able to manage the transformation and continues to grow the business which speaks volumes to the capability and value that lightpath is building with the completion of this financing we believe that the company is positioned for strong profitable growth as a result we will retain alliance advisors llc to initiate a proactive and targeted investor relations campaign and ensure that our shareholders and members of the investment community are properly informed of our strategy and competitive advantages as we move forward
988032 as a sign of confidence five directors of the board as well as two of lightpaths senior executives have invested in this financing this represented 12 of the total amount raised lightpath has the cost structure in place to pursue its new business model and with the continued cooperation of cdgm as well as the growth in relationships with other chinese suppliers and customers lightpath believes it will continue to improve its market share position and operational financial performance we also remain confident that in the future we will have the opportunity to further leverage our technology and manufacturing expertise in china with a chinese partner

988036 advances in dental and medical imaging are creating extremely large amounts of data that must be transferred between diverse locations

988415 wonderful branding idea it could be the nfl defensive player sponsored by deloitte
988416 its peter forsberg in 1995 the first year the avalanche were in denver but the uniform is way off the burgundy of the jersey is too bright red and hes wearing a black helmet even though the avs traditionally wear white helmets with their white jerseys
988417 a friend sent me this picture of cal ripken jr in his 1981 rochester red wings uniform
988418 the wings wore those god awful mesh backed caps with a heat sealed letter for most of the 1980s
988419 i couldnt find any merchandise with the old logo so i asked the owner of buc heaven in tampa supposedly when the culverhouse estate sold the team to the glazers in 97 they either told them they had to change the uniforms or else the glazers got a cheaper price if they didnt take the logo rights im not sure which is correct so the culverhouse estate still owns that logo and colors therefore the team cannot market the old logo and the culverhouse estate hasnt chosen to market it either the only loophole is if a player who played on a team prior to the sale in 97 puts his name on a product for example when i found a couple of shirts down there they all had this mike alstott tag
988420 the only player i could find who wore 18 for the blue jays that year was homer bush who had been released a month earlier
988421 by the time of this game bush had already been signed by the marlins so i find it hard to believe mondesi would still have an 18 inscribed in protest of the release
988422 damn i was right thats almost a flat out lime green
988423 i went to a twins angels game at met stadium in 1961 the first season of both teams and the angels didnt have a halo on their hats im pretty sure of that because i also watched the twins play them later on tv and thought to myself hey they have a halo on their hats now finding photos of halo less hats hasnt been easy but i finally this one aside from rocky bridgess hat note the absence of a halo on the angels player in the background
988424 i didnt know better id almost think it was a modified bicycle helmet

988430 no 8 strongly resembles reggie jackson who actually wore no 9

988434 social networking software holds enormous potential for improving the management of large enterprises
988435 however work in this area is still immature and in the meantime enterprises should be aware of what is happening in consumer social networking
988436 one of the problems with social networking is that it is a consumer phenomenon that has spread into the enterprise
988437 it is only now that people are beginning to realise policies governing its use need to be considered
988438 this challenges the popular belief that thieves target large businesses because they accept more payment card transactions
988439 small businesses are targeted much more often the proprietor of a corner store is unlikely to have it experience and few resources to buy and maintain various data security controls
988440 most surprising for me was the high proportion of card present compromises
988441 that could be anything from someone double swiping the card or using a scanner to vulnerabilities in the payment applications
988442 if a hacker is able to exploit a particular pos system by using the default log in credentials for example they can easily use the same exploit against other merchants using the same device and configuration
988443 the most common problem we encounter is that the merchant or application vendor has stored data they should not hold
988444 in many cases the retailer is not even aware that a credit card number has been stored in an application they are running
988445 retailers at that level will however switch banks to save a few dollars on transaction fees so if one bank threatens them with a fine theyll simply change to another bank
988446 on the other hand banks are obliged to keep their networks secure its a difficult position to be in
988447 the terminals are supposed to obfuscate credit card numbers when you swipe the card and the ticket prints out you should only see the first six and the last four digits with xxxxs in the middle
988448 if the receipt was lost or someone broke in and stole old receipts they would be unable to read the card number
988449 and theyre likely to be using a cheap hosting service and insecure off the shelf online shopping systems
988450 in one instance the bank had shut down its e commerce systems and couldnt trade until it made its systems secure
988451 people are focused on protecting the perimeter with firewalls and intrusion detection systems but the issue is that hackers are somehow able to get through
988452 firewalls also fail to stop insiders who suddenly decide to steal information its not just card data its employee medical information salary details and increasingly customer information that has been outsourced for processing
988453 if a company is able to encrypt sensitive data the problem goes away even if your system is breached if the data is encrypted the hackers get nothing
988454 a lot of this is appliance driven so it just comes down to normal it management
988455 youre actually embedding encryption in your web and application servers
988456 right now database administrators are able to look at any column of data such as salaries the technology now lets you encrypt that column only so that the database administrators and software programmers cant look at it and if intruders do get in they cant see it either
988457 in the us if you have a breach and the data was encrypted you dont have to report it its the only excuse permitted under us data breach notification laws
988458 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
988459 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multiculturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come
988460 in the context of being one of a range of views on evolution
988461 the government particularly under tony blair thinks it is wonderful to have children brought up with their traditional religions i call it brainwashing
988462 it seems as though teachers are terribly frightened of being thought racist its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic
988463 i was shocked by how some put up barriers to understanding
988464 i showed them the evidence and they just said this is what it says in my holy book and so i asked if your holy book says one thing but the evidence says something else you then go with your holy book and they said yes and i said why and they said its the way weve been brought up
988465 because we are all brought up to respect faith it leaves open a gap through which fanatics can charge
988466 if it werent for the catholic church elizabeth the 1st would have been driving a rolls royce
988467 if you choose not to believe in the creator you had better be right
988468 dawkins is terrified of it becoming more widely recognised that natural selection doesnt have all the answers e g the origin of life
988469 i am furious he is being told this nonsense and by a school friend and not the teachers
988470 i cannot be amazed after studying either a single cell or the human body that people can actually think that wonderful creation can just be the result of a string of accidental mutations
988471 simply because some people cannot find a way to explain creation by the limited knowledge of science that is currently available does not mean creation is myth
988472 we are very happy he has represented the country with distinction and deserves the honour
988473 his exemplary leadership and demeanour under pressure especially in the twenty20 world cup and the tri series in australia has made him an ideal role model for millions of young indians who want to make a mark in life
988474 what i like most about him apart from his cricket is the way he leads
988475 he is a cool customer and never gets agitated he displays clarity of thought and speaks his mind even if it may not be seen in the right sense

988665 any stroll in the himalayas or the andes maybe a dip in the ganges was going to leave the mysticism of the camino way back in the distance as far as i could tell i just wanted to go for a walk the idea of walking for weeks the appealing thing a bit of solitude and you can do that lots of places in the world and not have a pilgrim wake you from a doze in cow field to take a photo of him and his wife there was something we clearly didnt get but one thing was for sure i wasnt going to be doing it again galicia a sparsely populated state of spain in the far northwest had the lowest figures for tourism in the country that gets more tourists than anywhere else in europe so the lack of facilities should hardly have been surprising we could stay however in municipal albergues brand spanking new for 3 with disposable sheets and pillow cases expansive ktichens though no one in charge realised that kitchens really need saucepans fry pans cutlery and plates and maybe a nearby tienda that sold food but that of course was part of the charm maybe all the charm we walked into santiago seven hundred and seventy seven kilometres later 34 days did i feel good yes different fitter worth it if you have nothing better to do it was a hike for us and an achievement for sure

988674 i think if you asked any tennis player they would probably say that grand slams are the most important thing
988675 but the olympics only comes around every four years all of the top guys are playing it its going to be a terrific field
988676 i spoke to him last night he didnt manage to make the flight

988686 the oval was the scene of kevin pietersens wonderful ashes winning innings in 2005 and if he performs as impressively on the pitch as he did in his first press conference as england skipper he could be a good bet to get to three figures

988825 the smart specific measurable achievable realistic and time bound programme came out as a response to the swot we did within the organisation as to how the business was expanding what the it systems we had were and how it needed to cope with the growth
988826 the smart name was coined from a contest we ran within the business because were doing this project and at the end of it well impact close to 2000 plus employees so we wanted everybody to get involved and know the benefits of why were doing it so we started this whole project with a contest across the entire business where we wanted people to nominate project names we had close to 500 nominees out of which came smart
988827 we have a project on change management we had the competition for the smart name and we have t shirts and posters around part of this is to get enthusiasm because this is a 21 year old business so along with this come processes that have been there for the last 21 years some of them good some of them bad but people have been using them for a long time when things change you need to not just change the screens but bring in some enthusiasm so people use the application better and normally when you change like this there are a lot of challenges like what we faced in june
988828 there are 11 projects under smart including technology and business projects the primary objective was to slowly bring in oracle over the entire spectrum of the business from financials to our stores
988829 given the prevalence of large scale mobile device deployments here in the middle east and elsewhere enterprises have to build in a new strategic layer into their it plans terms like robust and secure may be somewhat over used but they do express the key factors that modern businesses need to consider for their mobile workforce especially if the work in hand is of a sensitive nature or defence related

988837 when we arrived both the woman and her horse were stuck at the bottom of a very steep ditch with slippery mud on the banks
988838 they were completely stuck and unable to lift themselves out the horse was also very distressed
988839 we were able to pull the woman free fairly easily but the rescue of the horse was a little more complex
988840 with the help of the farmer and under the advice of a vet we used a tractor to winch the horse out of the ditch

988860 being a small business founder i know that sometimes you are so busy with doing the actual work that needs to put cash in your bank that you dont even get to think at some business processes that are not really so hard
988861 what ive found is that most entrepreneurs are not taking the time to work
988862 having previous entrepreneurship experience doesnt make starting up a new business easier it actually makes it harder not only that you know what went wrong with the previous one but this time you also have something else to loose that can make you more cautious money and pride and if you had a great idea once its really so hard getting a new one that is as good as the last one
988863 f this you p bitch go back to afghanistan and you will be bombed
988864 she has just turned 19 but i think it is right to say that she had a very difficult childhood
988865 i know many people who appear before this court would say that but here it appears to be true and the defendant fully accepts her actions which i think should be taken into account
988866 she had just been to pick up her benefit cheque and met a friend when one drink turned into two two into three and so on
988867 it appears she lost her temper and fully accepts it is totally unacceptable and she remembered little about it but she pleaded guilty at the first opportunity on july 1
988868 we have given very serious considerations to a custodial sentence because we are concerned about the seriousness of this offence and your actions were fuelled by alcohol but we have given you credit for your early plea
988869 i think the main thing about this is its the boldest and bravest decision that could have been made
988870 my old mate and one of the best captains i have played under adam hollioake always said if you are not sure take the attacking option
988871 i think the selectors have done that theyve taken the most attacking option and hopefully that will work for them
988872 he is that kind of guy he said himself he has had text messages from players wishing him well and saying theyre right behind him
988873 he certainly isnt the kind of gut that would suffer fools gladly and he would certainly let people know if they were letting the side down on all of those things he looks he should be the right man to do the job hes certainly confident enough
988874 he said he had a meeting with peter moores yesterday and if it sounded as if it were a clear the air type of thing where they find out where responsibilities lie who is responsible for what and i think that is also very important
988875 i definitely thinkafter some of the comments michael vaughan made post headingley and from things that sneak out of the dressing room from time to time that perhaps the relationship had become a bit strained between captain and coach
988876 it is vital that the relationship between captain and coach is seen to be a good one because there is nothing more players can pick up on than seeing captain and coach that are not united in purpose that can bring things down
988877 more power to him for the fact that he decided to turn his back on his home country and come to england because he felt he wasnt going to get a fair go it takes a very brave man to do that
988878 in these times when the rules allow people to come and ply their trade and qualify one way or another if these guys are going to be in the team theres a chance they might captain the side one day
988879 if youre happy for kevin pietersen to score the winning runs in the ashes series then youve got to be happy for him to captain the side as well

988883 some of the services provided by cafcass in south yorkshire are adequate however some failings are serious and improvements are clearly necessary overall the region has a number of inadequacies particularly in the handling of private law cases where children may be left at risk from domestic violence due to delay in allocation of work inadequate risk assessment and poor reports to the courts ofsted will continue to work with cafcass in south yorkshire to ensure that services deliver better outcomes for children young people and families
988884 this is a bigger job than just captaining the england cricket team
988885 effectively you are leading english cricket and the english game hopefully that responsibility will dawn on kevin and his performances will improve as well
988886 theyve been pretty good so far and if they improve then that will be good for english cricket
988887 your immediate challenge is that youve got to get your head around all the things that happen as an england captain all the people that want a piece of you all the people that want an interview and different things from outside the cricket arena that can eat into your cricket time
988888 what youve got to do as a player is to make sure that youre complying to your number one job and his number one job for england is not the captaincy its scoring runs
988889 he has to make sure he protects his practice structure so thats not interfered with
988890 walking onto the field is the easy bit of being england captain its all the things that happen off the field that can worry you and unsettle you
988891 hes got to guard against that and hes going to need a lot of help and guidance from the coaching staff
988892 its a good idea to unify the two formats of the game under one leader and the continuity will be there
988893 hes certainly englands most dominant player and hes someone the rest of the players will respect because of his performances
988894 i dont think there was a lot of room for manoeuvre actually its too early for alastair cook because he needs to establish himself in both forms of cricket and i dont think hes done that in one day cricket completely
988895 andrew strauss has not been in the one day side and i dont think they were going to go back to andrew flintoff after what happened in australia so pietersens the logical choice hes an exciting choice as well

988900 online behavioral advertising moving the discussion forward to possible self regulatory principles
988901 whether legislation is needed to ensure that the same protections apply regardless of the particular technologies or companies involved
988902 behavioral advertising may help subsidize and support a diverse range of free online content and services that might otherwise not be available or that consumers would have to pay for for example blogging search engines and instant access to news and other information
988903 new technologies such as deep packet inspection technologies have the ability to track every single website that a consumer visits while surfing the web this sweeping ability to collect analyze and profile how individuals use their broadband connection raises clear privacy issues and i believe such activity should occur only with the express prior consent of individual citizens in addition individual websites and search engines and their affiliates that monitor users also owe consumers constructive notice of such activities and the right to limit or thwart any personal data collection

988905 its important we get a good start in any run chase but we didnt get it and being down 10 for three wasnt ideal
988906 the disappointment was in the first innings where we should have capitalised and put more pressure on the indians
988907 we should have got a few more runs on the board we played really good cricket for two to three days and we just lost it in the last two sessions of the fourth day
988908 thilan showed a lot of character to hang around there and batted well but it was a bit too much for him in the end

988910 in australia he batted really well malinda is coming into his own it is just that we need both of them to hang in there for a while
988911 one look at the dressing room shows you how much potential this team has this team has been through ups and downs and it has a fair amount of experience and quality
988912 there was no doubt we would regroup and come back hard im really proud of the way we played in this test
988913 the opening partnerships in both innings virender getting a double hundred and gautam gambhir getting us off to fantastic starts were very important
988914 also the way harbhajan singh bowled in both innings and how ishant sharma and zaheer khan bowled
988915 there is quality in this team and it augurs really well going into the last test
988916 as the series goes on you try and figure out the best possible ways to handle the spinners

989084 the bush administration and the president will be trying to keep this six party process on track but the process is a very fragile one and time is running out on the bush administration which somewhat ironically has come to regard the north korean negotiations as one of its most significant diplomatic successes

989096 if the current situation continues things will only get worse
989097 we will have fewer mobile phone makers fewer handset sales agents and fewer cellphone models i just dont see anything on the horizon that would makes things better
989098 with the market contracting at this pace and with development costs rising how are they going to make money
989099 theres a lot of opportunities to do things that are very much hands on were out there
989100 today with global communications with the integration of the global economy with the ability of actors to operate at long distances
989101 its possible that failed states at great distances from the united states and of course closer can represent a national security danger
989102 over the past 20 years over the course of 17 significant stabilization and reconstruction missions in which the united states has been involved too much of the effort has been borne by our men and women in uniform
989103 the capability that we are trying to create will be made up of serious professionals who have the type of skills that the governments need
989104 people who are engineers people who are involved in the rule of law meaning police men and judges and attorneys and corrections officials people who are public administrators or public health officials
989105 there are a lot of people in the united states who have done well in life they would like to give something back

989109 i have grave concern with the image of the united states as bad as it is around the world at this point that putting u s personnel on the ground will generate this kind of nationalist response against the united states and then imperil the people who weve deployed there
989110 what will be the political outcry in washington if you have u s personnel from the state department being killed
989111 i think the impulse would be to send in even greater numbers of u s military to sort of remedy the outcome

989113 there have been dozens and dozens and dozens of failed states that have existed throughout the world over the past 15 or 20 years and yet we have one data point to revert back to afghanistan in which there was actually a pressing threat to u s national security that happened to emerge from a failed state
989114 anyone who looked at pictures of the twin towers on september 11 cannot say that failed states are not an issue
989115 the point is that not all failed states represent a security challenge to the united states but some do

989160 as there is nothing which tends to elate a christian evangelist so much as the enjoyment of spiritual experience and as there is nothing so calculated to deflate the spiritual pride which may follow them as the opposition he encounters while preaching the word it is not unlikely that chrysostoms interpretation is nearer the truth than any other
989161 these enemies are a constant source of pain and inconvenience to me they are an irritating thorn in my side
989162 it is not difficult to envision an angel of satan stirring crowds to persecute paul it is also possible that the opposition includes the agents of satan against whom paul has been railing 11 13 15
989163 would the apostle pray to be spared persecution this is doubtful since persecution was the fuel on which paul seemed to thrive the more he was persecuted the more he seemed determined to press the claims of his apostolate
989164 you know it was because of a bodily ailment that i preached the gospel to you at first and though my condition was a trial to you you did not scorn or despise me but received me as an angel of god as christ jesus what then has become of the blessing you felt for i testify to you that if possible you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me

989173 people who are going to china should take a clean computer one with no data at all
989174 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
989175 a lot of places in the world including china dont have the same view of personal space and privacy that we do in the united states

989188 in person fitzgerald gave away little of the ruthless tragic vision which underpins her writing
989189 that is why so i have thought of your where she does reveal herself is among the most illuminating moving collections of letters that i have ever read
989190 pulsates too with the uncertainty of living the immediacy of everday impressions and an insight into the imaginative mind
989191 ventures towards what a lot of people are keen to see a full dress biography
989192 too often one doesnt know to what fitzgerald is responding or about whom she is talking
989193 but some serious work on the apparatus before the paperback would be very welcome she deserves as no one doubts the rolls royce treatment
989194 baffled in a collection that offers little or no information as to chronology or context seldom explains what any given letter is talking about and only sporadically indentifies people mentioned in the text

989231 yeah right you are just saying that how could i love her more than i do know
989232 how do you know what god is trying to tell you
989233 trust me its paradise this is where the hungry comes to feed for mine is a generation that circles the globe in search of something we havent tried before so never refuse an invitation never resist the unfamiliar never fail to be polite and never outstay your welcome just keep your mind open and suck in the experience and if it hurts you know what its probably worth it you hope and you dream but you never believe that something is gonna happen to you not like it does in the movies and when it actually does you expect it to feel different more visceral more real i was waiting for it to hit me hit me i still believe in paradise but now at least i know its not some place you can look for cause its not where you go its how you feel for a moment in your life and if you find that moment it will last forever
989234 its ok everyone goes through this at some point or another

989237 can we global we be responsible enough to utilize nuclear power
989238 i still catch myself trying to be one of the guys to prove that im no different from them just as good as them just as worthwhile as them
989239 deeply ingrained teaching that men are simply better than women
989240 no not really because i would tell you if you talk to the average marine thats what they came into the marine corps to do is to deploy now the leadership is very cautious to keep an eye on marines like that to ensure that were not burning them out thats why the commandant really wants to grow the force to 202k so we can give the warriors more dwell time back in the states the commandants goal is to give 14 months dwell time for every seven months deployed
989241 near term is the combat fitness test and the change with the body composition program
989242 hey sir you know we have a pft to test our physical fitness do we have anything that tests our combat fitness
989243 when youre in combat youre in full gear most of the time this combat fitness test is going to test our combat fitness and its long overdue it really is but were still going to keep the pft that tests our physical fitness so thats going to be one of the things that theyre going to see coming to pass very soon
989244 it should be coming to pass by next month the order should be on the street by early next month so thats going to be coming out very soon and thats going to tie in with the body composition program now i will also tell you that the combat fitness test will not be done at the same time as the pft laughs there were a lot of rumors out on the street about that and it will be done at separate times me i like to work out and i probably couldnt even do the cft and the pft on the same day
989245 no weve scheduled to do it in about two weeks
989246 yeah laughs you know the commandant is very much into physical fitness he is there and he leads by example and the marines see that so i dont think ill be carrying him but hell be carrying me laughs
989247 we have some marines that are getting out of shape in the marine corps
989248 hey our standards are kind of slipping on weight control
989249 the order is going to hit the street probably at the same time as the cft
989250 nothing is going to go in their record initially but they will be counseled
989251 you havent made the standards this is what you need to continue to try and get there
989252 even if you do make the weight control how does the marine look in uniform
989253 she did a first class that means hes or shes good to go
989254 yes i think thats the case and thats why the combat fitness test is going to make this a well rounded thing tied in with the physical thing its going to make marines go out to train to a standard where theyre well rounded physically
989255 like i said the pft tests different things than the cft the combat fitness test is pretty much endurance in combat the physical fitness test tests your cardiovascular ability and things like that because youre running longer plus youre testing upper body strength its different than carrying a marine on your back with full gear
989256 i think we need to keep both of them but if you talk to some of the marines maybe like eventually if this combat fitness test comes into play and its working and its testing the physical fitness and the combat fitness portion of it then who knows
989257 its a big increase and we are engaging every day on this you know it is not the marine that goes out and gets on a harley its the marine who goes out and gets on the fast motorcycles we are above where we were last year as far as motorcycle fatalities were trying to figure this thing out
989258 weve got great ncos in the marine corps they go to combat and they lead marines and they do great things in the marine corps but when they get back to garrison we tend to not give them the same responsibilities that we give them in combat and we shouldnt do that weve got to give them the same responsibilities in garrison that we give them in combat because they never fail us the commandant put out that message saying he wants ncos engaged because who knows the marines that are going to have something involving a safety incident who knows them better we dont its the ncos
989259 were delegating authority down to the ncos to do the safety checks to get us safety briefs and to say whether a marine should not be going on liberty because he is a threat to safety the ncos are engaging throughout the marine corps and we are working on it whenever we can losing one marine is too many because they are the most precious thing we have in the marine corps the individual marine
989260 this is not the marine corps that i grew up around
989261 it does not portray the great things that these marines are doing today i can tell you all about those things because we witness it throughout the marine corps one example is the wounded warriors in the hospital they just want to get back to their unit theyre not concerned about their wounds
989262 well msgt mcnasty is your boss so youll just have to listen and put up with it and do what he says youll rotate soon

989265 marrying the evolving video platform of the internet with the established mpeg cable operator platform is what activevideo does best in my opinion
989266 the user doesnt care if the content happens to be stashed on a video server on the cable operators network a web server thats out on the internet somewhere or located in their home network on a local content store be it a dvr or some other hard drive on the home network
989267 i think all thats left is to execute on that
989268 shows a strong commitment to operator needs and how to respond to them
989269 we do a lot of business with operators you have to have a pretty unique approach technology and understanding of their networks and thats what john brings to us
989270 he really brings that consumer focus to us in a way that we just didnt have it before
989271 i think i bring a combination of excitement and pragmatism
989272 the problem with vista is not that it doesnt demo well vista looks great when an expert cherry picks features for you and shows them to you with a microsoft configured and optimized machine the problem with vista is the experience of using it every day in the real world with real third party hardware and software

989354 but the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm werent simply controversial they werent simply a religious leaders effort to speak out against perceived injustice instead they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country a view that sees white racism as endemic and that elevates what is wrong with america above all that we know is right with america a view that sees the conflicts in the middle east as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like israel instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical islam

989370 christians in too many of our churches today are far more interested in being served rather than serving when they go to church they are more interested in what they get than what they give they are more concerned with being entertained than being edified subsequently the sad state of affairs is that more often than not entertainment has replaced worship yet we need to under that worship is not entertainment
989371 thus when we come to church we want what we so readily receive all week long fast paced up to the minute quality graphic entertainment unfortunately too many places on sunday morning are eager emphasis mine to give people what they want in an effort to reach them or more accurately to woo them in to membership

989373 we belittle grace and deny our people the best when we offer them financial security self esteem positive thinking and even family values instead of the all satisfying grace of god money will not satisfy when the doctors want to pull the plug on the life support systems people need grace positive thinking will not satisfy when a child drops out of school and joins a cult people need grace family values wont satisfy when she files for divorce papers because she wants no part of the faith people need grace

989425 but perhaps this model is a positive development especially in light of the increasingly close relationships between colleges and the private sector for job preparation if the coursework is more configurable around teh basic concepts that would feasibly generate courses that more readily meet the needs of a given industry
989426 meta skills to gain and interpret whatever knowledge i would need in the unpredictable future
989427 we want an elearning about health and safety in the workplace
989428 over a couple of thousand of video and audio clips that new hires and tenured employees are currently using for on boarding and training
989429 if you look closely through your lists you will find that many objections are based on the unwillingness to accept some aspect of the complexity of learning itself
989430 its ok if todays results dont show they will in time
989431 high fructose corn syrup is a sweetener used in pretty much all processed food
989432 why stop im not going to die if i keep going whats the worst that can happen
989433 powerpoint is a tool for verbal and visual presentation and isnt really suited for what most would call writing
989434 today president bush signed the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 i thank president bush and secretary paulson for their leadership in making government sponsored enterprise gse regulatory reform a reality
989435 i look forward to working with the combined federal housing finance board fhfb office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo and housing and urban development hud gse mission teams and with other regulators to ensure the safety and soundness of the 14 housing related gses and the stability of the nations housing finance system
989436 we are going to be talking about the appraisal business changes in the industry etc i set this thing up originally to talk about the hvcc im sure it will be a lively and interesting discussion im confident youll want to hear what mr biggers has to say
989437 jdean xxxx com and i see jason smith i add jason smith with an e mail address
989438 all of my appraisers provide this or do that why didnt you
989439 here now go call the other guy and chew on him because he told you what you wanted to hear not what you needed to know and i tried to protect you
989440 there is always a better way and it should be found
989441 the signing of an appraisal report or the transmittal of a report electronically shall indicate that the licensee has exercised complete direction and control over the appraisal
989442 i use lighthouse and ai ready converters occasionally these programs do not allow all elements of my reports to transfer across due to the limitations of the converters one example would be a 65 line adjustment that just happened to appear in a lighthouse converted format i missed that one and got a call back from the underwriter thank goodness i was able to send a pdf copy of my report i have also created already conversions that would not support typical trend charts aerial images and other forms that my software vendor supports i will be following this up with an article about working with these types of programs
989443 the form format and style of the report are functions of the needs of the intended users and appraisers
989444 to me this is really pretty simple its not that big of a deal the delivery of the appraisal report shoudl contain two files one is a pdf document that we create the other is a data packet in a common format that can be used by the clients to populate their computer systems it can not be that hard can it the most difficult part would be getting the industry lenders and software providers to agree on the common language format in which to transmit the data packet
989445 would there then be two separate versions of the report the appraiser would then be held responsible for the
989446 i hope the appraisers in ga appreciate the changes suggested by fnc and adopted by the board
989447 time to get a move on time to get back on the road
989448 hey baby you brought me coffee you get groovier every day

989455 despite seeing the fault lines none of these people could construct a plausible scenario in which the cold war wound down before 2025

989466 must be much higher now perhaps as much as half again i am not trying to suggest this is a very scientifically based figure it is extrapolated from the 2006 figure it is not new research
989467 the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomisation of the query id and the source port essentially making it all the more difficult to spoof the dns response
989468 however it appears that apple forgot something the client libraries on my os x 10 4 11 system post patch install still does not randomise the source port
989469 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
989470 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
989471 in these cases the network device performing pat port address translation uses a predictable source port allocation policy such as incremental allocation when performing the layer 4 rewrite operation that is necessary for pat
989472 i came to realise how much we take at face value we humans seem to be pleased with just accepting what we are told no matter how much it goes against our senses the earth is flat and horizontally infinite it stretches horizontally forever and it is at least 9 000 kilometres deep
989473 a cursory examination of a flat earth map fairly well explains the reason the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth circumnavigation is a case of travelling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth

989517 corruption engenders perverse political dependencies lost political opportunities to improve the general well being of the citizenry and fosters a climate of mistrust particularly of public officials
989518 the losses that accrue from a culture of permissiveness with respect to corruption include a loss of revenue loss of trust loss of values loss of credibility and legitimacy and a loss of the democratic ethos and impulse within institutions and organisations
989519 the concept of a national integrity system is fundamental to the development of an anti corruption discourse
989520 it comprises the building blocks necessary for the long term fight against corruption and other forms of unethical and anti social behaviour its core elements are constituted by a societys value system
989521 these are the essential preconditions for the elimination of corruption conflicts of interest and malpractice in the public sector
989522 the public interest and public trust must be constantly reaffirmed in the process of good governance
989523 sound administrative values of probity trust justice and fairness must be integrated in the daily work ethic of public servants
989524 this government can create such a national integrity framework through laws systems and structures but ultimately there needs to be on the part of leadership a voluntary submission to a higher code of probity which goes beyond strictly legal prescriptions
989525 this submission to a moral code ensures that institutions do not become vacuous without direction or purpose
989526 ethical behaviour while highly desirable respected and valued cannot be assumed this is why specific measures and institutions to safeguard integrity and to promote ethics are necessary
989527 the lack of these measures and institutions or their ineffective implementation and functioning opens the way for all manner of unethical behaviour including corruption
989528 a national integrity framework therefore provides both the institutional and philosophical basis for both enforcement and preventive action against corruption
989529 on occasion they find themselves in situations where they have to pay for government services they are entitled to

989541 the consequences of continued congressional inaction on gas prices are unacceptable weve called on the speaker to call congress back into an emergency session this month and schedule a vote on the american energy act we must continue to make a stand until the speaker complies
989542 we realize not everyone can be in washington next week but if you can be we ask that you come to the capitol join our colleagues and lend your voice beginning this monday at 10 00 am

989544 with american families and small businesses facing record high gasoline prices congress has adjourned to leave washington for a five week break
989545 the message this sends to the american people is bad enough its ramifications however are far worse
989546 congress should not take the next five weeks off while the american people suffer at the pump we respectfully request that you schedule a vote on the comprehensive american energy act during an emergency legislative session this month

989569 they are big shoes that i have to fill but i will give it the best possible go it is a great honour
989570 it is something that has turned my life around in the last 24 hours it has been a very emotional time for me

989588 people like it they come to speak to us they want to be in contact here i didnt see anybody that was negative on the contrary the people are very warm very nice they take islam to a beautiful place not a violent place when they hear i am from israel they react very warmly
989589 kosovars used to identify with the palestinians because we albanians are muslims and christians and we saw serbia and israel both as usurpers of land
989590 then we looked at a map and woke up israelis have a population of six million their backs to the sea and 300 million arab enemies albanians have a total population of eight million our backs to the sea and 200 million slav enemies so why should we identify with the arabs
989591 the conflict is not our problem we are muslims but not really we have respect for israelis because of the u s i have good friends from there
989592 albanians everywhere are aware that jews want to help them in this conflict
989593 and jews are aware and thankful to albanians for saving their lives during the second world war so we have our sympathy for israel i dont think the muslims here are on the side of the palestinians

989602 for example where i live the average house price at the peak of prices was 240 000 mainly because i live 1 hour from london on the train no use to me
989603 by the end of 2009 prices will be bouncing back due to massive pent up demand and the probable easing of credit conditions which we are starting to see marginally already we are a small overcrowded island where land is of a premium and house prices will always be under upward pressure in the right conditions

989654 js man a blues jam ive never heard until this and the genesis of music never stopped in which they work on it for about 45 min this is undoubtedly one of the first sessions as ive had david lemieux confirm this
989655 i just want the 2 28 75 out first just because serious collectors like us love this kind of shit in fact imho its the best ive ever heard them play in a studio the jams are very focused but long and loose music just oozed from garcia no doubt
989656 joe pokaski whos been behind some of our more favorite recent moments such as claires toe cutting experiment
989657 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
989658 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
989659 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
989660 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
989661 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
989662 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
989663 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
989664 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
989665 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
989666 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
989667 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
989668 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
989669 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
989670 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
989671 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
989672 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
989673 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
989674 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

989693 gov arnold schwarzenegger expressing frustration with lawmakers failure to approve a state budget ordered his administration thursday to lay off thousands of part time employees and moved to temporarily slash the pay of most full time staff
989694 the governor a republican apologized to state employees many of whom he acknowledged are already struggling in a difficult economy but he said he had no choice in the absence of a budget one month into the fiscal year
989695 nearly 200 000 employees could have their pay cut to the federal minimum wage of 6 55 an hour with full salary reimbursed once a budget is signed more than 10 000 lost their jobs thursday exceptions were made for those deemed too critical to let go for purposes of law enforcement public health and safety or other crucial services
989696 i have a responsibility to make sure that our state has enough money to pay its bills said the governor who signed an executive order shortly before noon at a news conference in sacramento
989697 it is far from clear however whether the governor can put the salary cuts into effect or how long it might take state controller john chiang a democrat who was elected to his post suggested that the governor had overstepped his authority and said he would not cooperate chiang made his statements in a letter to schwarzenegger and at a los angeles news conference
989698 i dont believe you have to do this budget with tax increases i do believe you may have to look at some tax loophole closures villines said
989699 you are creating a false association between roger niello the politician and my client the niello company attorney
989700 the veteran democratic politician announced his gubernatorial bid on the west steps of the capitol moments before gov arnold schwarzenegger signed an order to cut thousands of temporary state jobs and freeze pay of 200 000 workers at 6 55 an hour to help the state pay its bills
989701 the timing of garamendis announcement was no coincidence as he used the states budget standoff to tout his own credentials as a leader who can direct the california out of a fiscal morass

989703 with about three months left before the election the campaigns for and against the 12 propositions on the november ballot have amassed a total of almost 70 million according to campaign finance statements filed with the california secretary of state thursday and the sum is almost certain to soar as the election nears
989704 los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa raised 1 6 million for his 2009 reelection campaign in the first half of the year a sizable bundle of cash in a race where so far the first term mayor faces no well funded challengers
989705 villaraigosa raised the vast majority of the money during a fundraising tear in june when he held more than a dozen events and hopscotched across the country according to campaign finance reports filed thursday with the city ethics commission
989706 the funding package enshrined ambitious new goals but critics questioned the need for the bond as well as a price tag that more than doubled in the last two weeks
989707 this bond contains a wide ranging wish list of possible items that backers say would create
989708 the requested amount ballooned from 3 2 billion in recent days allowing district officials to assuage some critics and constituencies with additional dollars and letting board members pad funds earmarked for their favored priorities such as early childhood education centers even so the district has yet to allocate about 2 billion leaving that for future unspecified needs

989729 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
989730 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
989731 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
989732 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
989733 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats

989738 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
989739 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
989740 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
989741 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
989742 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

989746 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
989747 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
989748 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
989749 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
989750 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
989751 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
989752 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
989753 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
989754 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
989755 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
989756 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

989759 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
989760 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
989761 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
989762 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
989763 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
989764 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
989765 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
989766 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
989767 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
989768 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
989769 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
989770 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
989771 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
989772 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
989773 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
989774 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
989775 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
989776 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
989777 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
989778 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
989779 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
989780 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
989781 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
989782 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
989783 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
989784 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
989785 i see it as a real positive for our playing group and our club to have somebody of bens standard as a footballer to set an example on the training track and its great for our young players coming through
989786 ben really wants to be a part of the playing group he really wants to get back into the club environment and wants to see where hes at from a footballing perspective
989787 from meetings with ben ive been really impressed by what he wanted to do and what he wanted to achieve by being with us
989788 you see the condition hes in currently hes well and truly preparing himself
989789 hes an absolute professional and he was always classified as one of the best trainers at west coast and its the kind of workmanlike mentality he has that will set him up well and truly for next year

989849 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
989850 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
989851 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
989852 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
989853 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
989854 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
989855 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
989856 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

989864 quite amazingly average hourly earnings in july climbed only 3 4 year over year compared to a 4 year on year rise over the year ending in july of 2007 that is amazing because headline inflation rose by nearly 5 over the period to what does the fed owe this good fortune over the same period the jobless rate leapt climbing to 5 7 from 4 7 one year back relax president plosser the leap for joblessness is keeping wages in check
989865 we are considering the possibility of a convenient care model that could be open for patients with commercial care but this would be a medical home for patients that meet our financial eligibility and do not have insurance
989866 what they did is they saw this property they decided it was a good location and they went for it without community input
989867 first and foremost we have fought things associated with zoning changes on that property before
989868 at the end of the day if the data supports this location as being the best spot for the clinic i think that the residents immediately around that area are still going to have an issue with the zoning change
989869 i agree a smooth start was not done here and i commit to correcting that
989870 believe me that the intent for all of us is how to get maximum input
989871 if we were to ask residents of every location we would never pick a spot
989872 i would be concerned if it was going in my neighborhood
989873 i dont want to be involved in the design of a building when i dont believe that building should be located there
989874 i say please lets rewind lets start the process over lets look at the data and lets bring in the neighborhoods in north austin and east austin
989875 the way we set up our clinics is theyre disbursed but close to where the individuals that use it are
989876 our intent is to be convenient to the clients we serve
989877 i understand in some of the locations they didnt want to have to renovate the buildings and so thats why they werent chosen
989878 however i think that probably in the rush to just buy the land and to build brand new they didnt really carefully look at all their options i think that theres some way this can turn into a win win where they could get the land they want in a location that better serves the clients in the communities and where all the neighborhoods involved would be happy with the deal
989879 theres just some other vacant office lots within my neighborhood that i feel would really really be a good idea to see if tchd would be open to purchasing one of those properties close to us 183 to locate a new facility
989880 there are so many potential properties around the 183 area that are already empty medical office space or just general warehouse space large buildings that are just sitting vacant
989881 two dutch climbers were brought by our people and their colleagues down to base camp from an altitude of 7 300 metres overnight
989882 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite
989883 our helicopters are on standby but chances are slim for a rescue operation today it is likely that the italian will now be rescued tomorrow
989884 and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe
989885 the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
989886 carried down both living and dead people from the mountain
989887 there were plenty of youngsters on show too and they will benefit also

989889 its one thing when we see that the bbb bonds the junkiest sub prime crap in the residential mortgage backed securities rmbs universe getting shellacked due to foreclosures
989890 but today we see that the aa and even the aaa are getting whacked it looks like either a fund is getting liquidated across all asset qualities or someone is panicking
989891 defaults on commercial mortgage backed securities issued at the height of the credit bubble will more than quadruple from their current levels under conditions in the us economy expected by the commercial real estate industry according to a report from fitch ratings borrowers would default on an average of 17 2 per cent of securitised commercial mortgages over 10 years if the us economy dips into a recession with 0 2 per cent contraction in growth compared with current very low default rates of 4 per cent a rise of 330 per cent
989892 there is a time element here if you asked me in 2005 how bearish i was i would have said much more bearish than i am today
989893 a way for these institutions to be re capitalized without the government writing a check
989894 aggregate losses in the u s stock market since hte peak last october have totaled rougly 3 5 trillion
989895 our expectation is for the economic environment to continue to be weak
989896 and we re sorry and there s nothing else we can say
989897 were facing the worst housing recession in u s history
989898 were in an economy wide recession already one that will be much more severe than those of 1991 or 2001
989899 if youre a value guy are you buying now no
989900 it would be like catching a falling knife its a credit crisis and were going to see a lot worse before it gets better
989901 we are doing something thats never been done in central texas and we should be proud of that
989902 our schools are getting better but incremental change is not enough we need systemic change we all have a responsibility to commit ourselves to the future of our children
989903 it is critically important that we all work toward the success of our students
989904 graduates are made not born this community wide effort embodies the promise that all central texas students start school ready to learn
989905 we created e3 alliance to foster systemic change in the central texas region to say everything we are doing is sort of incremental around the edges and its not going to be enough
989906 if we want to build the kind of sustainable economy that we want to see in the future we have to vastly change the system and the outcomes we see from the system in terms of reaching the potential of every student
989907 it is regional in scope no region in the state of texas has ever had a blueprint for change student performance has gotten better but population is changing we simply cannot afford anyone not to reach their full potential we cannot afford for anyone to drop out its a work in progress its not finished the responsibility belongs to central texas not any one district
989908 these champion teams are the structure that were putting together to really execute and put into action the blueprint
989909 the problem with too many names defining and identifying central texas dropouts 2008
989910 over 90 percent of our jobs now require more than a high school degree but not necessarily a bachelors degree to have a world class economy we must have college ready graduates to make a graduate it takes being ready for college and a career
989911 even with all the great things we are doing too many students struggle in math and science and too many of them never get their diploma
989912 for the region to succeed all of our students need to reach their highest potential
989913 were not pointing at each independent school district and saying they are the solution they are only a percentage of the solution
989914 we are basically through the plan trying to preserve caves and bird habitat so that if everything else got developed it wouldnt destroy the species because that is what the law requires
989915 we thought it was a good fit for what williamson county is about but it makes sense for each individual
989916 it serves the purpose of the law and helps with development any time you build on the west side of ih 35 you have a good chance of hitting either a bird or bug habitat
989917 the only way to reconcile the growth issues with the need to protect open space is to plan on a regional basis
989918 it creates an entity that can step back take stock of the entire area and say yes we want growth but we also want to protect these areas
989919 developers to just write a check and destroy whatever they want of course you have to develop some of it but i think there is already an entity in place on the federal level i dont see a reason to create more government and more bureaucracy when there is something already there to protect the wildlife
989920 there are species that are endemic meaning they only live in this little outcrop
989921 from a state or a north american perspective it is a very small area you will not find the coffin cave mold beetle anywhere else in the world
989922 the good thing about the twin springs preserve is that it will actually provide credit within our county
989923 it is not going to be all outside the county where the birds are preserved there is going to be actual habitat there that we get credit for
989924 we will have enough of these caves that the species in the cave should be protected
989925 if everything else was developed we would have these caves that would keep these species from being extinct
989926 that grant was basically used for us to establish the plan
989927 consultants have to be hired we have environmental lawyers who are involved to help develop and write the plan and we deal with fish and wildlife all the time in trying to get this approved so there are quite a lot of costs
989928 since we dont have the permit yet we havent seen the involvement that we are going to have
989929 we anticipate it being very good because of the ease in getting the permit from the county rather than having to deal with fish and wildlife
989930 determined by the secretary of the interior to constitute a pest whose protection under the provisions of this act would present an overwhelming and overriding risk to man
989931 there are approximately 700 known caves in williamson county and this is about the only place where you can really come and go hiking and read about the caves and where we have activities available
989932 its very rare to have parks that are open like this
989933 thats what really got garth the up front cost to put the course in was unbelievable and the main clientele disappeared for a while
989934 theres no question its the nicest club north of the river probably one of the better ones in central texas
989935 all successful communities have a diversified product we were hurt in the past only being custom homes
989936 it was just synergy from the discussions the developers showing us their plans and us already talking about wanting to see stuff of that nature
989937 its one of those happy coincidences that came about at the same time
989938 having one of the premier golf courses in the central texas area is an asset in itself were proud to have it in hutto
989939 one of the things that is needed in the hutto market is higher end homes and more multi family housing
989940 definitely toll 130s opening has had an impact its really opened up our market and changed the whole landscape out here
989941 we did a limited purpose annexation of the property along fm 685 but the development probably wont be fully annexed into hutto for another 20 years
989942 the news is out in the headlines and therefore it is far too late to trade on it

989949 heres the test the gses have to pass as long as they can continue to issue debt on a timely basis and in the amount that is required to fund their business at a reasonable interest rate spread over treasuries then things will be okay no matter what the financial media says if they cant then the sh t will truly hit the fan heres an example of what im talking about lets say that 5 year fnma paper historically has traded at 50 basis points over 5 year treasuries if that spread blows out to 150 200 basis points because the bond market vigilantes no longer trust the implied government guarantee that historically has supported it then the game is over the government will then have to step in
989950 im not going to hurt you or get you into trouble i work here
989951 why is more difficult to answer maybe it is nothing more than an accident but maybe it is to remind the rest of us to carry compassion in our hearts for them
989952 we never saw so many people who cant walk in one place
989953 i cannot give you personal information about individuals but nobody can talk walk or toilet
989954 but mister this morning we saw two of them hobble on their feet but they didnt have wheelchairs did you run out of wheelchairs
989955 they need staff assistance to ambulate in their cases there is no reason for a wheelchair unless when traveling long distance
989956 no they are special people they just have different challenges in life you just cant judge them by what they look like
989957 mom was drinking too much one night my little brothers daddy told her to knock it off she got pissy and threw the bottle but it hit me in the head
