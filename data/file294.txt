2940000 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2940001 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2940002 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2940003 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2940004 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2940005 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2940006 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2940007 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2940008 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2940009 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2940010 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2940011 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2940012 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2940013 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2940014 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2940015 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2940016 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2940017 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2940018 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2940019 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2940020 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2940021 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2940022 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2940023 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2940024 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2940025 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2940026 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2940027 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2940028 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2940029 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2940030 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2940031 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2940032 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2940033 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2940034 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2940035 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2940036 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2940037 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2940038 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2940039 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2940040 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2940041 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2940042 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2940043 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2940044 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2940045 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2940046 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2940047 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2940048 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2940049 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2940050 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2940051 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2940052 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2940053 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2940054 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2940055 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2940056 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2940057 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2940058 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2940059 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2940060 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
2940061 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2940062 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2940063 estudamos metade das florestas remanescentes na austr lia e nossa estimativa de que elas podem armazenar por volta de 33 bilh es de toneladas de di xido de carbono
2940064 se todas essas florestas fossem derrubadas e todo o carbono na biomassa do solo fosse lan ado na atmosfera seria o equivalente a lan ar por cem anos cerca de 80 das emiss es anuais de gases estufa da austr lia

2940069 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
2940070 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
2940071 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
2940072 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
2940073 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2940074 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2940075 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing
2940076 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
2940077 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2940078 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2940079 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2940080 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2940081 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2940082 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2940083 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2940084 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
2940085 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2940086 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2940087 its personal with him in terms of his own legacy and the race stuff really left a bad taste in his mouth
2940088 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2940089 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2940090 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2940091 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

2940094 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2940095 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2940096 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2940097 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2940098 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2940099 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2940100 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2940101 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2940102 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2940103 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

2940220 the first day the wind was coming right at us and pushing the targets down
2940221 the second day it came as a straight tail wind
2940222 i watch the weather always so i made an adjustment to my gun to shoot a bit higher
2940223 you tell people youre changing something after you shoot enough for second place and a six target lead after day 1 and they look at you funny
2940224 hey lets finish this we were both straight on from there on we were focused i finished with a perfect 50 glenn would have done the same but one of the other guys walked up to congratulate him while he was still shooting
2940225 you take things for granted the gas chamber was not fun every recruit has to go through it in the chamber they put some sort of gas in there you have to take off your mask and stay in there for like 15 30 seconds or something it felt like an hour your eyes burn like its pepper spray though ive never been sprayed with that
2940226 glenn and i did this for a reason and we started shooting better as a result
2940227 we found out later that two tornados had hit just around us
2940228 but glenn looked over to me and said thanks jeff we could be in houston having fun right now

2940242 georgia has proposed a ceasefire and russia increased its offensive in response including bombing civilians and turning down international mediators
2940243 the actions by the russian military forces against the sovereign and independent country of georgia
2940244 it is pointlessness to continue a visa facilitation program with a country that does not meet even the minimal requirements set by the eu
2940245 obligations recorded on paper are necessary because the words of georgian leaders cannot be trusted in statements
2940246 as if on command several countries have taken positions critical of russia and are now hindering operations to enforce peace casting doubt on the methods goals timing
2940247 moscow will take that into account in the future when it conducts negotiations on the world order
2940248 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2940249 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border i again call on the government of russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2940250 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia the current escalation of military conflict resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate
2940251 continued military action will influence relations between the european union and russia
2940252 the territorial integrity of georgia is being violated on an unthinkable scale they are bombing georgia civilians are being killed and foreign forces are located on georgian territory
2940253 the eu and must take the initiative and stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of europe the russian federation has overstepped a red line in keeping the peace and stability in the conflict zone and in protecting russian citizens outside its own borders
2940254 we have seen powers before claiming that the violations of the rights of holders of their passports or their nationality by a previous germany in eastern europe or a previous serbia in former yugoslavia justify them sending their armies into these countries we have seen the wars that have followed the application of that principle and that is why it has repeatedly been made clear that it runs contrary to international law
2940255 petitioner respectfully prays that the honorable court issue a writ of prohibition commanding respondents government of the republic of the philippines peace panel and general hermogenes esperon jr from acting on and formally signing and implementing the grp milf moa for having been prepared finalized initialized signed under an unconstitutional process of lack of transparency and public consultation in violation of the peoples constitutional right of information and for containing provisions which clearly violate the constitution
2940256 among others the grp milf moa creates a bangsamoro homeland with the bje as the entity having authority and jurisdiction over the territory created and grants it with sovereign powers
2940257 what the legislative cannot do by mere enactment of an organic act and what the sovereign people cannot do without a majority vote in a plebiscite made for the purpose of creating a local government unit was miraculously and magically bestowed by the executive in the grp when the alleged provision creating the bangsamoro homeland and the bje with the powers of a sovereign state was agreed upon such a brazen attempt to circumvent the strict provisions of the constitution only highlights the necessity to grant the instant petition
2940258 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2940259 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2940260 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2940261 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2940262 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2940263 the taxi ranks were ideal locations for the activations as buses and taxis delivered new commuters every thirty minutes

2940266 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2940267 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2940268 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2940338 youve never faded youre always there with your white surface looking on silently
2940339 putting while keeping your eyes closed gives you the feeling you need in your stroke there is no anticipation of impact and no visual cues from the hole or the ball its now pure stroke which is the goal of professional players
2940340 its when we put the ball and the hole into the mix that everything goes south
2940341 you want to feel how the stroke just flows back and forth and theres no grabbing the putter around impact
2940342 just stroke the ball and enjoy the feeling of rolling it across the ground without worrying where its going
2940343 then your mind and focus might not be in the same place
2940344 it was a great opening match for me and the team niang and cisse were both absolutely amazing up front they bossed the proceedings for us and sealed the three points
2940345 im very pleased to capture mamadou sakho he was highly rated at psg and we are lucky to be able to get him i think he will be ready for first team action pretty soon despite his young age
2940346 i came down and i was really excited by marks plans for the team he wants to get the title back from lyon i want to be part of the new look side at marseille another reason for coming was the fans they are absolutely amazing so i want to give them something to cheer about by winning some silverware this season
2940347 marseille are the most successful club in french football history not to mention it is the most widely supported but still we have not won anything for over a decade that is simply not good enough
2940348 i love france and ive continued to follow marseille and come to as many games as possible
2940349 the main thing for marseille is to return to the glory days we want to start with winning the league but we want to continue to win it and make it ours again we have a stiff challenge with lyon but we will do our best
2940350 im backing mark to the hilt with money and any other resources he needs we want the league title back in marseille in future we want to build on this to become a force in europe once more
2940351 when marseille came in i immediately wanted to move to them the french league is a brilliant league i didnt want to move to england i can speak french so it is a much more comfortable move for me personally
2940352 steven defour is a great talent the players should be excited about his arrival not angered any player who spends his time complaining about new signings instead of training hard to keep a first team place should not be at marseille
2940353 he is a naturally gifted striker so it would seem stupid to not play him there
2940354 it was difficult to leave bordeaux ive been at the club for a long time but i want to improve and win things i think marseille is the best place for that and my future
2940355 when i was approached for the job and asked what players i wanted to bring in henri saivet and mamadou sakho were the first two names i mentioned they are both hugely talented youngsters who will have bright futures here at marseille

2940389 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2940390 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2940391 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2940393 this parrot is gone to join the biggest nightclub of them all
2940394 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2940395 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2940396 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2940397 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2940398 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2940399 everytime when i am holiday i usually come here to pray and encourage my friend to look at life positively
2940400 i share my experience with friends and i sometimes give them some small lessons i acquire at school
2940401 now that the supreme court has ruled to grant guantanamo detainees access to federal courts to seek writs of habeas corpus we must be certain both that the courts have clear guidance on how to adjudicate these cases and that our national security is not compromised in the process
2940402 that is congress role and this legislation addresses those national security concerns by protecting classified information limiting the burdens placed on our military and intelligence personnel and directing the courts not to release any detainees into the united states while also ensuring that the judges deciding these cases will have the kind of record before them to make sound decisions on the underlying facts

2940407 aku tidak mengetahui jika ada seorang wanita yang lebih banyak berkahnya terhadap kaumnya daripada juwairiyah
2940408 rasulullah menawan wanita wanita bani musthaliq kemudian beliau menyisihkan seperlima dari antara mereka dan membagikannya kepada kaum muslimin bagi penunggang kuda mendapat dua bagian dan lelaki yang lain mendapat satu bagian juwainiyah jatuh ke tangan tsabit bin qais bin samas al anshari sebelumnya juwairiyah menikah dengan anak pamannya yaitu musafi bin shafwan bin malik bin juzaimah yang tewas dalam pertempuran melawan kaum muslimin ketika rasulullah tengah berkumpul denganku juwainiyah datang menanyakan tentang penjanjian pembebasannya aku sangat membencinya ketika dia menemui beliau kemudian dia benkata ya rasulullah aku juwainiyah binti al harits pemimpin kaumnya sekarang ini aku tengah berada dalam kekuasaan tsabit bin qais dia membebaniku dengan sembilan keping emas padahal aku sangat menginginkan kebebasanku beliau bertanya apakah engkau menginginkan sesuatu yang lebih dari itu dia balik bertanya apakah gerangan itu beliau menjawab aku penuhi permintaanmu dalam membayar sembilan keping emas dan aku akan menikahimu dia menjawab baiklah ya rasulullah
2940409 ya muhammad engkau telah menawan putriku ini adalah tebusan untuk kebebasannya
2940410 di manakah kedua unta yang engkau sembunyikan di al haqiq di tempat anu dan anu
2940411 aku bersaksi tiada tuhan selain allah dan engkau adalah utusannya tiada yang mengetahui hal itu selain allah
2940412 nama juwainiyah binti al harits merupakan perubahan dan burrah rasulullah menggantinya menjadi juwairiyah karena khawatir disebut bahwa beliau keluar dan rumah burrah
2940413 ketika itu rasulullah hendak melakukan shalat fajar dan keluar dan tempatnya setelah shalat fajar dan duduk hingga matahani meninggi beliau pulang sementara juwairiyah tetap dalam shalatnya juwairiah berkata aku tetap giat shalat setelahmu ya rasulullah nabi bersabda aku akan mengatakan sebuah kalimat setelahmu jika engkau kenjakan niscaya akan lebih berat dalarn timbangan maha suci allah sebanyak yang dia ciptakan maha suci allah penghias arasy nya maha suci allah unsur seluruh kalimat nya
2940414 tidaklah seseorang yang mencintaimu kecuali dia adalah seorang mukmin dan tidak membencimu kecuali dia adalah seorang munafik
2940415 membantah ahlul bidah termasuk jihad di jalan allah dan melindungi dari perkara perkara yang bukan dari nya mengarang kitab bantahan dan menyebarkannya adalah haq dan merupakan dakwah kepada kebenaran serta jihad di jalan allah barangsiapa menganggap bahwa mengarang kitab bantahan mencetak dan menyebarkannya adalah bidah maka dia salah
2940416 jangan kamu berbicara dengan mereka dan jangan pula meriwayatkan hadits dari mereka karena mereka adalah pendusta

2940425 1 heres the list of some movies coming out for this month
2940426 in the near future toorop vin diesel is a mercenary who takes the job of escorting a woman from eastern europe to new york while he thinks this is just an ordinary mission he gradually finds out that his guest is carrying an organism that has the potential to become the next messiah and everybody wants to get their hands on it
2940427 because if you fail the makeup exam then you will be in real trouble
2940428 i think if we did that at the moment when we do not know 100 per cent that ccs is going to work the engineering has not yet been tested and no one is fully aware of what the costs might be then that would put an end to coal fired power stations and demonstration plant and people would build gas again
2940429 i dont want to exaggerate but gas comes from some fairly unstable parts of the world and some not readily associated with human rights and democracy
2940430 if as some kind of gesture we said no to new coal fired power stations we would be in a very difficult position of not being able to develop this ccs technology ourselves
2940431 i do not feel obliged to believe that the same god who has endowed us with sense reason and intellect has intended us to forego their use
2940432 weve got the ship tied to the dock now but theres countless testing still to be done

2940437 we were able to contain the fighting in north cotabato areas and we dont see it spreading across the muslim areas
2940438 we are always looking at humanitarian disaster everytime huge numbers of people are driven from their homes
2940439 they could be worried about it spreading about it becoming just general fighting
2940440 unless we get a full blown war over there then thats the only time it might significantly affect markets
2940441 we never looked at an agenda of term extension that is not the ultimate objective

2940459 dave you talk look like and act just like all the americanzas on this site if you didnt include in your profile that picture of you serving in the idf i dont think we would have met thank god you posted it
2940460 dave you got her its been a couple of months and your ego has been satisfied whos next
2940461 i knew not to blurt out that i worked at a nice wall street job or that i volunteered to serve in an idf combat unit i had to subtly work this information into the conversation so as not to come off as bragging
2940462 it was all about projecting myself touching an emotional button inside the other person and sparking a chemical reaction it was bottom line a game of conquest
2940463 remember positive energy is creative and negative is destructive here is your kabbalah lesson for the day
2940464 it feels like our crew has this bubble around us of just pure confidence in each other and what weve come out here to accomplish
2940465 the calls started around 7 30 pm on saturday and went right through to 04 30 am
2940466 i would say around 90 per cent of the calls were to help with peoples flooded homes and we were pumping water out of houses all over fife from leven to dunfermline and across to st andrews
2940467 the amount of rain was unbelievable and were really hoping the sun coming out in the morning will really help to make a difference
2940468 the aftermath is major for the individuals who had water pouring into their house but fortunately there were no evacuations needed
2940469 even though there was no major emergency in real terms the situation is that many people have had their homes flooded and they are now left trying to sort that out
2940470 there were a few motorists who tried to drive on through what they were thought were puddles
2940471 but they then had to abandon their cars after realising just how deep the water lying on the roads was
2940472 were turning the page on what happened and were looking forward to be operating normally for the rest of the summer
2940473 this is exactly what china wanted to prevent the internationalization of the uyghur question
2940474 im concerned that this could polarize the uyghur and chinese communities it will make the situation more tense it will confirm china in its belief that the uyghurs are all somehow terrorists while the uyghurs will be angry that they are demonized and discriminated against
2940475 china has a track record of using very broad repression rather than a targeted one
2940476 its security measures are too indiscriminate they dont make a distinction between political agitation and terrorism when you call everyone a terrorist its hard to identify the right people
2940477 it shouldnt have been put in a residential area it should not have been there nobody did a damn thing nobody and now the damage is done
2940478 this facility was allowed under zoning that has been there for well over a decade
2940479 he adjusted his evidence so often that it was apparent that he was manoeuvring himself out of liability
2940480 we pray that our employee parminda saini who is missing is found alive and if so we urge him to contact the police
2940481 we regret the discomfort and inconvenience caused to all those whove been affected by this
2940482 he was filling up his truck and he saw either some smoke or some type of gas and went to report that and left the area as he was leaving the area there was an explosion
2940483 you just see a ball of fire coming towards you everyone standing at the front of the building ran
2940484 all you kept hearing was bang after bang after bang about five of them were jet loud
2940485 blew me out of bed it just blew me out of bed
2940486 my husband started yelling weve got to get down to the basement
2940487 i swear to you it was out of a movie it did not feel real at all
2940488 when i first heard the bombs i thought this is the end of our life here we said goodbye to it
2940489 i had a nice house and four cows and now i am a homeless man
2940490 they just sit here we have to bring food to them
2940491 the old people couldnt walk and in the russian peacekeeper trucks they were shooting at us
2940492 we are really a small nation why are they georgians trying to eliminate us cant the u s see us sitting here
2940493 please let the world know that what is happening in south ossetia is disgusting
2940494 we knew that if we stayed we would be killed
2940495 congratulations to him his first title shot he did awesome
2940496 this loss is maybe the best thing that happened to him its going to make him stronger
2940497 im going to fight everybody everybody who deserves a title shot
2940498 i know b j penn wants it and im ready to do it whoever they give me ill do it
2940499 i want to put the fight together lets do it
2940500 i just dont understand why the police took my sons life
2940501 he was shy he wasnt the type of guy who would antagonize a police officer
2940502 he didnt like clubbing or drinking beer he was a quiet guy he liked to stay in
2940503 why why did the police officer need to kill him
2940504 i cant tell you what they were doing we dont even know how many teenagers there were
2940505 i think right now im at a point where i dont think i can hurt it any further
2940506 obviously i have to try to be conservative at times im still going to go as hard as i can but i want to be here for the rest of the year
2940507 theyre digging pretty deep into the shoulder and under the capsule trying to loosen up some tissue and were doing that and im out trying to play and swing a baseball bat at the same time were kind of counter acting what were doing so well give it time to cool it down a little bit and get in there and dig and get after it without having to swing a bat
2940508 maybe in a couple of weeks we get some more range of motion and maybe we can get the old scotty back here
2940509 if not if it takes longer than that maybe next year
2940510 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2940511 this is not about questioning the managers judgement or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2940512 we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2940513 i think an august transfer is still a possibility although kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal he is waiting and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea normally milan do not sell their best players we think they like the proposal but it is not so easy for them to accept it for now we must just wait and see
2940514 i have always said that i am very happy at chelsea
2940515 its a great team with great players and a great coach everythings going well here and i have two years left on my contract and i will spend them at chelsea
2940516 during this time of tragic grief the family of master cpl josh roberts asks that media respect their privacy until such time as they are prepared to make themselves available please understand that this is a time of tremendous shock and grief and that arrangements have to be made a member of the family will be made available at a later date
2940517 josh was a soldier he had always wanted to be a soldier and he loved what he did he felt strongly in what he was doing and the family is hopeful canadians will understand and appreciate the sacrifice josh has made for all canadians and the sacrifice of all families of military personnel serving in afghanistan
2940518 he was a real soldier very good at it just a skilled and qualified soldier i had a lot of respect for him and this is a real tragedy
2940519 known as a dedicated and natural leader he was a very outgoing likable man and will be missed
2940520 rest in peace josh i have never seen my friend happier than since shes been with you ill take care of your little boy for you
2940521 find the peace in death that you fought for in life goodbye brother
2940522 if thaksin really doesnt come back the conflict in our country will lessen which implies that our prolonged political trouble will come to an end soon
2940523 he sought the secrets of the pole but sees the secrets of god
2940524 a tree is male its buds are female its leaves are neuter
2940525 horses are sexless gods are male cats are female tomcats included
2940526 any language is a supreme achievement of a uniquely human collective genius as divine and endless a mystery as a living organism
2940527 id say im a linguist but id been struggling to get a handle on welsh until i started using a software package my husband is welsh and his parents speak it as their first language so i really wanted to be able to say at least a few words in their native tongue
2940528 id tried various books but was finding welsh a nightmare until a friend recommended rosetta stones software i was worried at first because im not very computer savvy but it uses pictures and sounds to guide you through various levels of the language without having to translate anything
2940529 its idiot proof when im in the study with the door shut the language just comes alive and i become totally immersed its totally different from teaching or learning a language in a classroom the programme also gives me the benefits of having a welsh speaker in the room without it being my husband who just takes the mickey
2940530 dyn dan awyren is the first welsh expression i used on my husband when he was standing outside looking at a low flying plane it means man under aeroplane perhaps you had to be there but it was so funny
2940531 before i met my partner isabelle two years ago my french was really very basic but since then its improved dramatically
2940532 my number one goal is being able to sit down with isabelles parents at christmas and have a proper conversation its nerve racking enough to meet your partners parents without having to worry about the language
2940533 svp parlez vous anglais which as everyone knows means please do you speak english i always find that it gets me out of trouble
2940534 i went to china in 2003 after id graduated to teach english at a university in ningbo a big city near shanghai
2940535 learning written mandarin the language spoken in most of china is as hard as it looks
2940536 speaking is a little bit easier and once you start to make an effort you pick up words quite quickly
2940537 i ended up staying for more than three years and marrying li li who is from ningbo we now live near manchester where i teach at a secondary school my year 8 class just won a british council prize for a mandarin play i taught them so i guess i ended up doing pretty well
2940538 ive been travelling to italy on holiday for five or six years but about a year ago i decided to make an effort to learn the language i found the best way for me was the michel thomas audio programme which ive now got on my ipod
2940539 ive always thought that evening classes were for people who cant decide if they want to learn pottery or basic weaving and by that i mean theyre for people who want a past time or social club classes just werent for me
2940540 id also tried lots of audio books but they can be so useless teaching pointless phases like oh look theres a donkey on the beach call me a taxi but this programme builds up structure in an unique way now my italian is pretty passable italian people gasp in surprise when i speak a little bit of italian simply because theyre so used to english people going there and just shouting loudly in english
2940541 i quite like lacqua fa ruggine which i think means water makes rust it refers to a preference for alcoholic drink rather than water
2940542 as my partner is from sweden i decided it would be a great opportunity to finally learn a second language id been learning the odd phrase here and there from my girlfriend until i heard about an evening class run by a swedish postgraduate student in the local bookshop
2940543 the classes were really relaxed with generally no more than two other students wed do exercises from textbooks and practise reading writing and speaking it was pretty much everything youd expect in a normal language course except in a more relaxed environment
2940544 the classes gave me enough basics to continue on my own and i can now hold a simple conversation in swedish later this month ill be moving there to study for a ma in politics although the course will be taught in english i hope that by the time i complete it i will have learnt a second language
2940545 i dont mind the dark discovering the day cause the night is a beautiful bright blue and gray
2940546 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium i dont think either of us expected it and especially a gold and a bronze its absolutely amazing
2940547 it hasnt sunk in yet im just over the moon
2940548 i didnt really know what to expect this morning because it was a hard swim last night to get into the final for two british girls to get on the podium is amazing and i am so happy for both of us its great for british swimming
2940549 it was a lot harder this morning we just tried to ignore the times and race the final
2940550 i dont think either of us are natural sprinters we dont do the 100m free so we are naturally suited to the back half of the race
2940551 we didnt panic when we were a little bit behind i didnt see anyone past katie i didnt know what was going on i couldnt see what there was on the other side of the pool i saw katie and just tried to catch her
2940552 i went out a bit slow yesterday so i wanted to go faster today and managed to hold on
2940553 im confident i like being the underdog i like going in and being someone that no one really recognises
2940554 i knew there was a small chance someone would pull out and i just smashed my pb there so im really happy
2940555 i found out last night at 10pm so that had me up for another two hours
2940556 i was mostly relieved and then i knew i could make the final im feeling a bit lucky in this meet so hopefully if all goes well you never know what can happen anyone in the final is going for a medal and thats what im going to be doing
2940557 the last 12 hours have been an emotional rollercoaster for me but anything that doesnt kill you makes you stronger im gaining all the experience i need so im really happy
2940558 just trying to enjoy 100 per cent the experience and later try my best on court
2940559 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
2940560 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess
2940561 i had a lot of opportunities i didnt convert so that was tough
2940562 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
2940563 it is brilliant fun to be here it is an experience you wouldnt get anywhere else
2940564 when you get a length up on the usa and look back on them you think that is such a long way
2940565 we have things to work on like our start but we know we have got raw speed we have been working on the first half of our rave and i think it showed today
2940566 it was hard going back home but i think we dealt with it quite well and used it to our advantage
2940567 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward
2940568 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
2940569 there were times in practice i was wondering if i made the right move
2940570 to be totally honest with you i didnt know the jets were 4 12 last year until i got up here
2940571 im looking to buy a centre forward dannys departure has freed up some money for one player
2940572 my job will simply be to keep my head down and get these players working
2940573 and i want to make sure i build on that
2940574 the rogue employers who underpay the nmw deserve zero tolerance the nmw is making a real difference to the lives of many low paid migrant workers and we must continue to crack down on those mean bosses not paying their staff the legal wage to which they are entitled
2940575 uk unions are stepping up their efforts to organise migrant workers to stop employers from using a poor grasp of english or ignorance of uk employment law as an excuse to treat people badly
2940576 they screwed up thats all we didnt ask for it
2940577 podem ainda n o estar a ver as coisas superficie mas por baixo j est tudo a arder
2940578 pauls utterly enchanted with nancy and hes already rolling the idea of marriage around in his head he adores everything about her he thinks shes the one and told stella as much
2940579 he said what would you say if i asked nancy to be the next mrs mccartney and she joked back at least shes financially independent the whole family thinks nancys great a vast improvement on pauls last love interest
2940580 theyve been with each other 24 7 a perfect way to see if theyre suitable for marriage pauls not about to rush into anything but hes happier than hes been for years theyve got so much in common he knows heather was a mistake although he loves their little one bea more than anything and wont be put off by a bad divorce experience
2940581 nancy and bruce have been separated a long time but her relationship with paul has spurred them on to finally dissolve the marriage theyve moved on with their lives and bruce approves of paul its all amicable
2940582 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2940583 it was blown completely out of proportion i never overdosed
2940584 its something that people go through in their lives especially growing up in london and its not something ive ever had a problem with
2940585 the lawbreakers drove a taxi to the local public security office industry and business administration and other sites and tossed homemade explosives destroying two police vehicles
2940586 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium we just tried to ignore the times and race the final
2940587 i dont think either of us are natural sprinters we dont do the 100m free so we are naturally suited to the back half of the race
2940588 we didnt panic when we were a little bit behind i didnt see anyone past katie i didnt know what was going on
2940589 i couldnt see what there was on the other side of the pool i saw katie and just tried to catch her
2940590 i dont think either of us expected it and especially a gold and a bronze its absolutely amazing
2940591 it hasnt sunk in yet im just over the moon
2940592 fewer than the number of staff employed by a typical medium sized city council in europe
2940593 the commission desperately tries to play down just how many people are now working for the eu

2940700 it is time that people showed more respect for their neighbours and time that the small minority who seem intent on creating trouble sought out new and peaceful ways to resolve their differences
2940701 this is another example of the fear and intimidation that some individuals are trying to instil in this community and they will not succeed

2940800 los maestros est n muy disconformes y existe un malestar manifiesto por la falta de respuestas del gobierno
2940801 es fundamental decirle al mercado que se equivoca cuando piensa que vamos a defaultear en tres meses por eso queremos dejar en claro que no s lo tenemos voluntad de pago sino que tambi n tenemos capacidad para hacer frente a los vencimientos
2940802 la se al es clara y es lo que har a cualquier director financiero de una compa a cuando ve que el mercado les est poniendo un precio injusto a sus activos sale a recomprar su deuda
2940803 es bueno adelantar qu tipo de bonos se van a recomprar porque lo que se quiere es despejar las dudas que tiene el mercado que precisamente son respecto de los vencimientos del 2008 y 2009

2940809 b you blog or plan to blog about journalism in some shape or form
2940810 the insert object called they want their insert related object back
2940811 hatton admits he perhaps should have quit grahams camp after his sole defeat against floyd mayweather jr last december
2940812 maybe i should have realized billy was struggling a couple of fights ago but ive put it off and put it off
2940813 billy thinks other people have conspired for him to leave but i am the boss and make the final decisions billy would have still been in the camp if hed swallowed his pride and said lee isnt coming in to takeover hes coming in to help me but typical proud billy im billy graham im not working with some amateur coach
2940814 the work has got harder for billy over the years and he has been a bit slower that is not his fault but he is in his 50s and cant do what he could at 33 or 43 i love billy but cant have a trainer who has admitted umpteen times that he is physically beaten how can i expect him to be okay for the next 12 weeks while im preparing to fight malignaggi
2940815 there is no way billy could have been on top form and continue training me how do i know how hard or correctly im punching when he has needles and cannot feel his hands when were on the pads he might say youre hitting hard but i would be thinking how do you know you cant feel your hands
2940816 if he thinks anything of me hell have a good look in the mirror and admit im falling to bits im physically done i dont want to hear from my trainer who is taking so much medication to ease the pain dont worry rick ill get through this training session it is me who needs to get through sessions because im the one taking the punches
2940817 so and so editor just read the blog can you turn that post into a story for the paper tomorrow
2940818 a good blog post doesnt always make for an easily turned story

2940829 you want to be playing well going into the finals regardless of whether you finished eighth or you finished fourth
2940830 theres no point in sort of limping into the finals in poor form or with a lot of injuries
2940831 the concern at the moment is i think we played some really good footy on the weekend and weve got to play some more good football this week against geelong
2940832 ive spoken to the 49ers today so were going to ship him over there at the end of the year and ive actually asked for a coaching position cause they get paid a fortune
2940833 the afl dont want a 17th and an 18th team they want a team on the gold coast and in western sydney
2940834 so the only reason there is no team in tasmania is i think there is half a million people and theyre split all over the state its as simple as that
2940835 someone will finish fourth and fifth and sixth because theyve won more games than the team that finished 12th
2940836 at the end of the day im just thankful for all the opportunities that ive had throughout my diving career
2940837 thats the end of my career on 10 metre no more 10 metre events for me
2940838 ive got some springboard events to focus on here at the olympics
2940839 so ill just be focusing on those now and well see how those go
2940840 i had so many things that i needed to prove to myself
2940841 and one was to see if i could make another olympic games

2940899 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans

2940932 that was exciting it was such a crowd there and to be able to get so close to him it was like a miracle i really wanted to be able to do that because i know that as time goes on with all the security and everything the chances of getting close to a candidate or the president which i hope hell be would be very slim
2940933 its a very good picture if i have to say so myself it turned out really clear and crisp and i will keep that picture forever whether he wins the nomination or not i think hes already made history and ive been a part of it
2940934 with the economy in las vegas you have to be more creative in what you deliver
2940935 were trying to give people more options for their money
2940936 not too many people know what their parents really do for a living
2940937 there arent a whole lot of unique ideas left in las vegas its about how you deliver them
2940938 its pretty simple banks are forced to take their leverage down which means they have to be more discerning and that means you either lend less or you charge more for the money
2940939 nobody is going to lend to new projects in las vegas until theres some visibility about how all this new supply of rooms gets absorbed
2940940 if youre not almost done with a project youre just not going to do anything for a long time in las vegas
2940941 we have one or two options were looking at and its possible well sign someone this week
2940942 the strikers position is something thats been pressing since the end of last season but now there is some light at the end of the tunnel
2940943 the technology used at the games opening ceremony was some of the most complicated in history
2940944 one of the features of the ceremony was its perfect combination of advanced technology and great originality
2940945 since all of the facilities were completed on june 10 we had only two months to tackle any problems
2940946 it was the first time such a huge globe was used in china
2940947 the material on its surface was a kind of flexible aluminum
2940948 when you put up creative betting propositions like this as an oddsmaker its really you versus them
2940949 and sometimes youre in for a real tough fight the people youre going up against are not lightweights a lot of them are cruiserweights and heavyweights
2940950 but i think challenging bettors you might not really want to go up against can make you sharper
2940951 basically were getting into a situation where we want to offer more of these creative props that can give the player a pretty fair shake a fair shot and a fair bet
2940952 if it makes you think and if you can make a case for either side then its probably the right number
2940953 its interesting to note that if the jets play to projection they would still likely not make the playoffs
2940954 i just worked on things he came in there a little weird and i had to get adjusted but once i did it was a good fight from there

2940956 if you saw it in the beginning it is different it will be different if you see it next year
2940957 we have to look at this with a long term perspective
2940958 this is a long term dream this is not going to be done overnight
2940959 this in a sense to me is the first tangible proof that what we are working on has the support of the community
2940960 i think this is really the beginning from my point of view of a strong trajectory
2940961 at the moment were not asking for 25 000 donations
2940962 were taking a look at who we can hit up for 25 million plus and those things really cannot be done by fundraisers they just cant when people talk to me about giving money if they want to talk to me about important money they better send the president or the ceo
2940963 its very difficult right now to talk to donors about what your plans are for the health sciences system specifically and get them involved in a specific program when you dont know what those programs will be
2940964 lots of people who had lots of cash dont have the cash anymore
2940965 that was the way jim rogers distinguished himself from other excellent candidates was his ability to raise private funds
2940966 the representations that he made when he was hired was he was the person who could raise the money and obviously those were representations that we relied upon
2940967 it seems that his ability to raise money has sometimes gone to the wayside
2940968 theres been an influx of graffiti all over the walls of public and private property
2940969 i want to send a clear message to those committing these silly crimes
2940970 its less likely theyll be going to school and less likely theyll be going to work
2940971 to arrest these guys period there are no more warnings for graffiti vandals
2940972 maybe you put them on tv and cut off a thumb that may be the right thing to do
2940973 at some point someone has to stop turning their head
2940974 im sick and tired of being sick and tired about this
2940975 what has happened to the luxury market is what happened to the rest of the market
2940976 the key culprit is not demand nor desire but the inability to get loans for this kind of product
2940977 it is hard for one market segment to be unaffected in an overall down market
2940978 i think when you see that happen there is no way you can spin that into something positive
2940979 are not as motivated to make it happen and can wait if they have to move they are going to respond to the market and make it happen
2940980 a lot of buyers are not making the step at this time because of consumer confidence and concerns of the market
2940981 but it is the best time to move up because whenever the market is moving down youve got a greater potential of making money
2940982 i think like everything else it will pick up as the financing improves

2940987 for that paramount pictures flew me to burbank picked me up in a limousine like a celebrity and took me to the warner bros lot
2940988 it only took 30 minutes to do the voice over and they were happy about that
2940989 theres nothing before your time it will come to you when its time to come to you
2940990 if anybody told me a small town country girl like me who was on welfare and section 8 would end up doing what im doing i wouldnt have believed them but i beat all that god has helped put me where i am now
2940991 the choir would go into nursing homes around macon and sing for the residents bring them food baskets
2940992 but she really got behind me she said youre going to have the baby and youre going to stay in school and youre going to get the diploma i had the baby just before i graduated
2940993 police work is very stressful and i would go in with a good attitude and i kept everyone laughing
2940994 id say something funny about stuff all the time and i didnt know it at the time but i guess i was mimicking tina turner
2940995 one day some people in the department came up to me and asked if i could come to a party they were having and do the tina turner bit
2940996 i had to decide between a steady job and being an entertainer
2940997 when people called me to do tina turner it was usually in the week and i would take off work sometimes to do it but i couldnt keep doing it
2940998 people would tell me how much i looked like her
2940999 i was at the convention all day and then i went home for 30 minutes to change and in comes oprah and her film crew looking for me
2941000 anytime youre talking about public money its important that you account for it in an appropriate manner any form of better record keeping would be appropriate in this case
2941001 you should have some accountability for days worked and some kind of evaluation as to how they are doing
2941002 the constitution provides for elected judges and pro tems are not elected so they shouldnt be allowed to make substantive rulings that the constitution has reserved for elected judges answerable to the people
2941003 if a county commissioner cant make a meeting he doesnt go get someone to be a county commissioner for the day
2941004 we try to be cognizant of when one of us is gone and we cover for each other
2941005 if there was anybody abusing the system wed be all over them
2941006 if you dont do a good job youre not going to be sitting there very long
2941007 the last thing the judges want is for them to come back from vacation or a seminar and have to clean up the mess you left
2941008 restoration of tskhinvali will take a lot of time and means
2941009 situation in south ossetia will affect negatively on all other conflicts in the region georgia always avoided signing an agreement on non use of military forces
2941010 the new zealand government calls on all parties to exercise restraint
2941011 we call for an immediate ceasefire and a resumption of negotiations to end the conflict
2941012 peace should be restored in our country in order to settle the issues within a political dialogue
2941013 so strong international reaction will permit to stop the war on the georgian territory
2941014 we get familiar with the situation submitted our proposals to georgian president and wait for response we will also meet with refugees and later meet with lavrov and putin in moscow
2941015 definitely isnt the sign of a peace treaty non aggression treaty between them peace between societies embraces and demands the integration of all of them into a peaceful and harmonic society in which the respect the tolerance the freedom and the justice are present not only in the common day living but also into the cooperation and mutual social development between them
2941016 we need the fans but they should know their level they do not make administrative decisions they cannot chase the coach because its us who hired him
2941017 we cannot borrow money to clean ghosts from the payroll when we know who created them in the first place
2941018 in terms of product uptake this is the best performing in the history of any product launch in uganda and most likely the region
2941019 our target was to reach 50 per cent of the base within 6 months but we should reach that target over the weekend an amazing response to an amazing product
2941020 first muhoozi like any ugandan qualifies to be whatever he likes even becoming president
2941021 as far as the promotion goes questions arise because the person who appoints is his father
2941022 are officers who joined the army with him at the same level who determines training a key consideration in promotions are the promotions regular

2941024 maj serunjoji ddamulira is in the uk maj olupot is in kenya and maj mutambi in india
2941025 through a military coup which is always a possibility and through democratic elections which means lt col muhoozi would need to be a party candidate
2941026 when it rains the water would be much but then gradually be channelled out
2941027 the plan is to redevelop mubs by going up instead of buildings being scattered and wasting land
2941028 the current parliamentary buildings will be given to kampala city council
2941029 those affected will be made aware when the project starts
2941030 may be it is at the planning stage and not yet communicated to us
2941031 what i know is that we are planning to expand our chambers at the site we are currently we are waiting for funds from government
2941032 as leaders in the division we have been beleaguered by the turn of events in the area and we ask for the presidents urgent intervention
2941033 his men are seizing each and every market in the division and we believe it is only him who can put a stop to this
2941034 i had known that our people in budadiri west are politically orphans this young man nandala came to parliament during the nrm rule because before there was no parliament in uganda but when he got there he started fighting the government
2941035 now because you are orphans i am appointing dr wabudeya beatrice to deal with your issues from now
2941036 you are really missing out because whatever goes to parliament goes through nrm caucus where your mp kajeke does not sit so he is there to sit and wait for a finished product because in parliament we just bring what is finished to put a stamp
2941037 mr president you promised us shs3 billion to bail out bcu from heavy indebtedness and we have never received the money
2941038 you are telling people lies the president gave us the money that helped us secure the land titles that had been confiscated by jobbing fields company
2941039 we brought the girl to the pastor for him to pray and chase the demons which have been disturbing her but we are surprised to discover that the girl was pregnant

2941044 wurden im rahmen der vom bundesministerium f r gesundheit bmg in auftrag gegebenen kampagne die neue gesundheitsversicherung auch vorproduzierte h rfunkberichte erstellt
2941045 vollst ndig sendef hige h rfunkbeitr ge wurden nicht erstellt
2941046 dass dies auch nach der gesundheitsreform f r die krankenkassen gilt hoffen viele
2941047 f r mich ist der hausarzt tarif ideal weil ich sowieso zuerst immer zum hausarzt gehe
2941048 der hausarzt oder die haus rztin kann eigentlich am besten beurteilen welche zus tzliche fach rztliche behandlungen oder untersuchungen ich ben tige
2941049 also die zuh rer werden bewusst get uscht durch diese radiobeitr ge sie k nnen nicht erkennen dass es keine beitr ge aus der redaktion des jeweiligen senders sind dass es gekaufte informationen sind und die unternehmen wollen ja genau das das ist ja das ziel warum sie diese beitr ge berhaupt in auftrag geben
2941050 frau schmidt d rften wir sie ganz kurz ansprechen eine frage f r die ard ich bin von report mainz wir haben recherchiert es geht um die pr des gesundheitsministeriums haben sie
2941051 ich kann ihnen jetzt nichts dazu sagen bitte melden sie sich an bei uns
2941052 bei der beauftragten pr agentur wurde vom bundesministerium f r gesundheit die erarbeitung von h rfunkbeitr gen in auftrag gegeben
2941053 die journalistische einbettung oblag immer den dortigen redaktionen und nur im zusammenhang mit der moderation durch den sender ergibt sich ein vollst ndig sendef higer h rfunkbeitrag
2941054 es gibt f r eine bestimmte anzahl von sendern klare absprachen und da gibt es auch vertr ge darin ist festsgelegt dass diese sender schlenker beitr ge spielen und daf r zahlt schlenker pr diesen sendern auch geld
2941055 die lieferten uns beitr ge an die haben wir dann ausgestrahlt haben diese anmoderiert mit stimmen von uns und f r jede ausstrahlung bekamen wir dann einen gewissen obolus von schlenker praktisch der name schlenker wurde nat rlich auch nie genannt eine anmoderation wurde mitgeliefert die haben wir uns dann umgeschrieben sage ich mal aber inhaltlich ist sie gleich geblieben
2941056 hier dr ngen sich zwei verdachtsmomente auf bei diesen beitr gen einmal dass es sich um politische werbung handeln k nnte das ist verboten nach dem rundfunkstaatsvertrag und zum zweiten wenn die redaktionen geld daf r genommen haben dass solche beitr ge ausstrahlen dann ist es schleichwerbung dann ist es sogar politische schleichwerbung der h rer wird hier in die irre gef hrt das darf nicht sein wir w rden als medienaufsicht wenn wir die hinweise bekommen die radiostationen nat rlich angehen das berpr fen und dann gegebenenfalls sanktionen aussprechen
2941057 die politik ist glaube ich hier auch der pressefreiheit und der freien berichterstattung verpflichtet und hier wird mit steuergeldern eigentlich die freie berichterstattung ausgeh hlt hier wird versucht die pressefreiheit so weit einzuengen dass sie gar nicht mehr wahrgenommen werden kann die verantwortlichen m ssen hier auch zur rechenschaft gezogen werden das hat mit der aufgabe der regierung mit der aufgabe von ministerien nichts mehr zu tun

2941087 we cannot allow such illegal elections to prevail in dp we are only three months away to the delegates conference why should we split the party for only one party post
2941088 how can a serious party like dp invite its officials via sms and without an agenda

2941184 color sargent bourne states unequivocally in his letter that i should give you every consideration do you have any idea why he might write that
2941185 sir the color sargent and my father first sargent robert chard claiborne served together in the crimea at balaclava sir

2941193 corporal claiborne there are twelve hundred men in this regiment you cant possibly expect to get along or like all of them the duty roster will not be changed especially not because you have some petty quarrel with one of your men i absolutely will not allow you to trouble the major on this trivial issue be grateful he even gave you those stripes
2941194 i advised the major against it youre a runt claiborne youre too puny youll never make it in the light horse now i advise you to get along claiborne get about your duties

2941210 lets not irritate the physicians or else theyre going to take their patients to another hospital
2941211 the number one issue in the errors that occur is bad communication
2941212 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
2941213 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress
2941214 surgeons hold patients lives in their hands yet theyre dependent on equipment and people who are outside their control this incident was over a year ago and there has not been another incident with this physician
2941215 you have an industry in crisis where people are having to do much more with limited resources that combination can be a potent one
2941216 its very unjust never once did i attempt to thrust atheism on these children i was scrupulously careful not to do that i was simply trying to persuade them to look at the evidence it was a pro evolution point rather than an anti religious point
2941217 i do get a bit exasperated at people hearing what they expect me to say rather than what i do say
2941218 perhaps the most powerful idea ever to occur to a human mind
2941219 we find no vestige of a beginning no prospect of an end
2941220 if you actually look at the god delusion including those bits people think are strident and shrill and so on i like to think theyre actually funny

2941222 its a bit like the dilemma of a doctor who has a patient who has terminal cancer and the doctor has to decide whether to tell the truth or regard the patients private consolation as outweighing the truth if i were talking to an individual who had recently been bereaved i probably would hold my tongue in a way that i dont for anybody who chooses to read the book
2941223 you cant appreciate english literature for a start unless youre pretty knowledgeable about the bible if you dont understand what it means when someone alludes to
2941224 just glorious and its not just the music the drama of the passion of jesus as a work of fiction is something you can lose yourself in just as one can reading a novel you dont have to believe that heathcliff and cathy really existed to get caught up in the emotion
2941225 but if your main object is to understand how the universe works the question of whether or not theres a god in the universe is profoundly important
2941226 so i wouldnt wish to muzzle myself or anybody else for the sake of a skirmish in american schools about evolution
2941227 pauls utterly enchanted with nancy and hes already rolling the idea of marriage around in his head he adores everything about her he thinks shes the one and told his daughter stella as much
2941228 he said what would you say if i asked nancy to be the next mrs mccartney and she joked back at least shes financially independent the whole family thinks nancys great a vast improvement on pauls last love interest
2941229 theyve been with each other 24 7 a perfect way to see if theyre suitable for marriage pauls not about to rush into anything but hes happier than hes been for years theyve got so much in common

2941233 when stuczynski jumped 4 90 then 4 92 at the us olympic trials on july 6 it made me so angry because everyone started to say isinbayeva is finished we have a new star
2941234 it made me angry and i am happy for that feeling because i hadnt felt it enough since my last world record
2941235 today i feel like the previous isinbayeva before i was full of problems but after changes in my technique my personal life my coach my life generally i think i am stronger now in my personal condition i run faster i long jump longer but more important inside i feel so happy so calm
2941236 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of tennessee its time to turn the page on a politics driven by negativity and division so that we can come together to lift up our communities and our country
2941237 hes not black and he cant represent me thats just the bottom line
2941238 while hes in our churches clapping his hands and tapping his feet
2941239 he is the only senator who thought our kids shouldnt be allowed to pray in school

2941243 there is some ability among the second and third string players
2941244 but clearly there is a lot of execution work that needs to happen with our younger players to provide the depth we are doing to need so i think thats going to be our focus through the early part of next week is trying to get our younger players caught up who we are going to need to play a role in our depth
2941245 we saw a lot of young linebackers and secondary players and so there is going to be some pretty critical decisions made as you watch maybe monday or tuesdays practice as to players that might have moved up or down the depth chart
2941246 our focus now is trying to look at contingencies based on injury et cetera and saturday was a great chance to do that and i am not as comfortable as i was with possibly some of our depth
2941247 it was just beyond imaginable words cant express how i felt playing out there it was just a great way to kick off the olympics for me for my teammates to get a win the way they did
2941248 first half was just jitters and anxiousness to get out there and get started
2941249 we knew it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams we just calmed down and played a lot better basketball
2941250 you have to dunk they have three 7 footers i dont know what your definition of showing off is that was hard basketball
2941251 when you coach at byu you know the pecking order
2941252 a lot of kids didnt realize this was a division i basketball program
2941253 next year at this time you may be talking to another athletic director expectations have to change for me for the coaches for the administration if you want what other institutions have theres a price to be paid thats expectations thats effort thats commitment on all fronts
2941254 were trying our level best to be ready should that invitation ever come
2941255 were better off now than we were five years ago when we applied
2941256 i dont feel the pressure to build it i feel the pressure to achieve what we should achieve so many resources are being poured into the program
2941257 ive been given the keys to a car thats just been tuned up and everybody else has been just pushing it around
2941258 we played them twice before the olympics and they played well both times against us
2941259 we were a little wound up a little sped up and they came out hitting from all angles
2941260 just as loud if not louder than they did for china
2941261 i thought it would be more one sided but it was really mixed

2941280 we expect to have more people attending than the 800 to 900 who came last year
2941281 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2941282 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2941283 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2941284 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2941285 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2941286 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2941287 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2941288 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2941289 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2941290 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2941291 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
2941292 but thats how you make great stuff you dont make great stuff by wearing a nice sweater and drinking a martini you make great stuff by digging your fucking teeth in
2941293 i think he really liked the game and he felt is was something that was greatly interesting i cant speak for sam you know but thats my interpretation of what he said
2941294 we are aware of this matter and necessary measures have been taken against them
2941295 we have clear guidelines for all employees in funcom not least those who work with customer service and if the guidelines are broken there are consequences
2941296 one of the big achievements of the western civilized world is the realization that human sexuality is more complex than the straightjacket that restrained our thinking in the 19 th and 20 th centuries not until the end of the 20 th and beginning of the 21 st century did broad layers of the population begin to accept bisexuality homosexuality and transexuality in some european countries however this emancipation is still very much taboo today not long ago in milan for example a major presentation of homosexuality and art was banned by the city council the day before it was due to open principally because it included an explicit nude photograph of a hermaphrodite
2941297 you could compare it asian music to what happened to reggae through the seventies
2941298 it was a music that expressed the voice of a small community its now a british form of music it has earned its place in the history of music
2941299 i think many of our problems as a country would be solved if people had thick passports
2941300 theres just no substitute for actually going and seeing things
2941301 you start to feel a level of responsibility to direct attention to things that actually matter more than to silly things like who youre dating
2941302 for a lot of actors our biggest fear is that were going to start talking about things we dont fully understand and sound like idiots
2941303 in the long run ill do much more good if when i open my mouth i have something worth saying

2941318 also please excuse the fact that i was stupid for trying it on my face in the first place i was desperate then and im even more so now
2941319 we have no reason to criticise chinas action in tibet after what weve done in iraq and afghanistan
2941320 boris administration was actually more right wing than appointments like rosie boycott might make it appear

2941327 im so proud to be british both of us here two britons on the medals podium what else can i ask for
2941328 it was really hard i felt like i would just be hanging on
2941329 i gave it everything i had she got me at the end but i feel like i did a good race by putting it out there silver is a step above bronze
2941330 i would have loved to have touched first but there was nothing much more i could do
2941331 he would tell something to the malays and another to the chinese because he has two faces and split tongues
2941332 obviously liow has not been following anwars electoral campaigns and speeches across the country
2941333 anwar has consistently said that all malaysians would be treated equally on religious freedom justice business and education opportunities
2941334 what is liows stand on all these he has never revealed it in parliament
2941335 pkr and anwar were the ones invoking racial politics and splitting malaysians on communal lines to garner votes all this while
2941336 they believe the anwar led coalition could deliver equality freedom and justice to all
2941337 thus liow does not have any public standing to talk about multi racial politics when he is from a mono racial party
2941338 my wife and i have travelled to reside in england
2941339 if i still have luck i would come back to die on thai soil like every other thai person
2941340 what happened to my family is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
2941341 there is a continuation of dictatorship managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
2941342 my wife and i will stay in england where democracy is more important
2941343 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
2941344 i cant speak for anyone else but for me getting up in the morning and going fast is a bit of a challenge
2941345 i wasnt entirely satisfied with that race but coming in one of my goals was to get a personal best time and get a second swim and i accomplished that
2941346 im not happy with it at all but its a great setup for my 200 which is what ive been training for
2941347 i knew that i was out slow yesterday and i tried to go out faster and tried a lot harder but it wasnt faster and ended up being an overall waste of time but i knew i had to do something different and i tried i took myself out of my comfort zone and it didnt work but ive got a couple more races
2941348 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2941349 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches

2941351 misys and arab bank have a long history of successful partnership and i am delighted we are enhancing that with our addition of the islamic equation service
2941352 the middle eastern sharia banking industry is one of the worlds great banking success stories and it is essential for arab bank to be supported by industry leading technology as we continue to further expand our services across the region
2941353 we are witnessing a rapid growth of the islamic finance market with sharia compliant products more in demand than ever before misys is working at the forefront of developing new functionality that underpins banks back office operations and this extension of our work with arab bank is an excellent example of how we add real value to our islamic banking clients
2941354 at a time when we want to encourage more students to enter third level it would short sighted and short termist to respond to the funding crisis by imposing what would essentially be a tax on those hoping to get a degree
2941355 even if fees were initially only applied to what are called better off families it would be only a matter of time before threshold levels were dropped and the vast majority of families would again be facing fees
2941356 given that fees for many courses would now be more than 6 000 per annum their introduction would simply make it impossible for many families to send their children to third level
2941357 if we are in a situation where the economy is weak i have to ensure that high standards in our third level colleges are maintained
2941358 i want to see how the colleges are spending the existing funds i want to make sure we are getting full value for money

2941363 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2941364 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2941365 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2941366 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2941367 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2941368 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2941369 det r v l inte bra att ha g tt ner n stan 14 kg jag har ju minst lika mycket till som m ste bort innan dess r jag inte duktig nog

2941371 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2941372 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2941386 we need to stop hostility we dont need further military action we need to stop it we need to bring back peace and a cease fire is about both sides
2941387 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2941388 that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations

2941397 the work of the impeachment committee is almost complete it is giving finishing touches to the charge sheet
2941398 we gave him a chance to resign we gave him a few months but we have come to the conclusion that now the people of pakistan through their elected representatives in the parliament will have to do that
2941399 first the provincial assemblies will pass resolutions calling for musharraf to quit and this will happen during this week

2941403 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
2941404 these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
2941405 in the past i would have thought of my influentials as external to my marketing
2941406 now i think about who the influentials are in my customers space because i now focus on my customers rather than product
2941407 it begins with the content creators which is a relatively small percentage
2941408 then there is a larger percentage that are content consumers these people go online they browse they read things and email but they are not creators or bloggers they are not submitting reviews to amazon or commenting on blogs they are not interacting
2941409 content sharers are the ones that find interesting content then either save it online so someone else can find it add it to a list or pass it on
2941410 it has become much easier and more efficient for companies to identify and to communicate with their influencers
2941411 people who are interested in engaging in a two way dialogue with brands in particular tend to be more likely to be influencers
2941412 individuals that make up a network do not exist without influencers in their midst and influencers do not exist without surrounding themselves with others that make up the network
2941413 influencers need to relate to what you are talking about
2941414 for example if we were working on digital cameras for sony there are a certain number of bloggers or people who would be influencers for anyone buying a digital camera those would not be the same influencers if i was trying to sell baby food
2941415 i like photography and if you ask me to recommend a great digital slr camera id have an opinion but im not a professional in that category
2941416 i am a professional marketer but the reason people are influential is because of the voice and the number of people who read their work its not necessarily because of what they do for a living or because of any sort of training that they have
2941417 it could be online or through real life events lets not forget that people do actually meet up in real life
2941418 there are some that have characterised influencer marketing as marketing to the know it alls who are running around telling people what to do all the time like the tiresome people at parties
2941419 but what we find is that when we look at influencers they are as likely to be on the receiving end of advice as to be on the sending end of advice on every conversation they participate in so they are simply more engaged and it is very much a two way engagement
2941420 its a good way of finding out who does have some influence in your area and what they are saying after all everyone wants their slice of fame
2941421 one of the very practical things i suggest to marketers who are interested in doing this is to make a concerted effort to get to know their strongest brand advocates

2941571 i needed to see the film to make sure it was a foul it was right and i apologised temporary moments of insanity are ok
2941572 a gold medal is the ultimate validation of an athletics career in our sport and hearing the national anthem played in my name would be more powerful than the medal itself
2941573 but if i dont win it then its not going to change the way i look back on my career you dont do this for the medals and people who do are not usually that successful
2941574 if i perform to the best of my ability then i have achieved my goal if that gets me silver then thats fine with me if someone throws 22 something and beats me i can live with that its when i dont perform and lose when i get annoyed and frustrated
2941575 we know we are the best in the world and expect to do well
2941576 weve had chances to do that in recent olympic games and world championships and its eluded us we are all ready for some big performances we just need to go and execute
2941577 my whole life as an athlete ive been working to win grand slams
2941578 as a tennis player you never work to win a gold medal but my gold medal is the only trophy that i really want to show to people its my favorite thing that i have
2941579 i need to be here to win a gold medal thats my goal
2941580 you know theres a lot of people everyone wants to win but theres only one who can and hopefully that can be me
2941581 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess i mean these athletes sometimes dont get to see other athletes in such an intimate way
2941582 its like okay youre an athlete youre doing well too so if anything its such a big compliment to myself it makes me feel really cool
2941583 there are a few tennis players staying in the village i know lindsay davenport is
2941584 also i know theres a lot of basketball athletes who arent staying in the village theres a lot of athletes in general who are staying at hotels not staying at the village
2941585 i was a little nervous going out there yesterday because you know its the first time you played singles at the

2941590 not surprisingly this focus has resulted in a club whose demographics more closely reflect those of the city of cupertino
2941591 i imagine it was a pretty horrific scene with two people getting struck by a vehicle and not stopping and continuing on
2941592 thats what were looking for once you find the vehicle thats the one piece of the puzzle
2941593 were trying to locate anyone connected with the driver were looking for the registered owner or anyone who had custody of the vehicle at that time
2941594 it just seemed that it would be useful to someone somewhere
2941595 any enhancement to our gis that provides additional relevant info to our response crews is obviously a benefit
2941596 theres probably 10 things we can do with the data were not even aware of yet
2941597 theres a system you enter and you find out if there are opportunities to do something that hasnt been done before
2941598 in this way each photo was accurately attached to its corresponding parcel in the citys online database
2941599 all my life i could never say anything about that to anybody

2941610 were trying to locate anyone connected with the driver were looking for the registered owner or anyone who had custody of the vehicle at that time
2941611 theyd say oh no no no they wanted to walk on their own
2941612 people are aggressive theyre mean and they dont respect the lights
2941613 in a few other cases these people have asked for forgiveness and their request is under review
2941614 while coleman natural beef is a relatively small supplier for whole foods market we are extremely disappointed that we must now question colemans assurances
2941615 nobody knows the horrific pain you go through when you lose a child
2941616 grief isnt something you get over its something you go through it becomes a part of you
2941617 you think of all the memories and you cant help but cry
2941618 ive spent the last 14 years trying to find a way out of darkness
2941619 it comes down in the end to buses vs books and our mission is to educate children
2941620 weve paid up to 4 36 a gallon for diesel at a bulk rate this time last year it was 3
2941621 we are not subsidized by the state and theres not even a state budget
2941622 we dont know how much money well have do we stop busing altogether do we go with a reduction in routes every dollar that fuel goes up comes out of our general fund do we pay for gas instead of pencils
2941623 they see 327 and they dont want to pay it
2941624 but they dont think of the savings in the long run in terms of their own gas
2941625 three hundred dollars is a lot of money particularly at the moment
2941626 he has a lot of after school activities now and sometimes the bus schedule doesnt work out its cheaper for him to take the bus than for me to drive him but i end up driving a lot anyway
2941627 when i first arrived here i had a different expectation
2941628 i thought i would be a full time student but i have to work to pay my rent and send money to my family
2941629 if there was no food in the store we can find food in the forest here you cannot find food in the forest
2941630 when i was in my village i hear of america

2941635 nadie puede creerse que iu no quiera un nuevo centro de salud en este municipio
2941636 pretend a la alcaldesa era sacar un titular diciendo precisamente eso que iu no quer a un nuevo centro de salud lo que se acord por parte de todos los grupos pol ticos incluido el pp era convocar comisi n al d a siguiente que efectivamente se celebr el la cual todos los partidos decidimos qu suelo se podr a ceder y en qu condiciones con el fin de que ciempozuelos tenga otro nuevo centro de salud p blico y adem s de gesti n p blica

2941639 its been such a long time ive been disappointed we havent been able to repeat it the last olympic victory
2941640 we were in tears up there but at least we didnt have a camera on us
2941641 its the most emotional swimming meeting ive been in since adrians gold and this eclipses it
2941642 the whole team is absolutely buzzing over it its mind blowing
2941643 looking back in the last 20 years weve had four womens finalists full stop and all of a sudden youve got a gold and a bronze
2941644 for her to win that one first the thing is how she now takes that on i thought the 400 would be a bit beyond her
2941645 thats a great mark of somebody whos going to go places she really wants to improve improve improve
2941646 all it needed was a look at her mental attitude because some swimmers cave in under pressure when i saw her and heard her interview i knew she could do it
2941647 i think bill sweetenham took a lot of flak but he shook things up and lottery funding weve now had more funding into the sport for coaches facilities its taken that long to see the benefits
2941648 ive only been shooting this for the past two years so i definitely didnt expect to do this so early in my career this is an incredible blessing
2941649 this is really wonderful hes a guy that japan can be proud of
2941650 of course everyone in our dealing room watched kitajimas race
2941651 i guess no matter how strong you are there is a moment of carelessness
2941652 but everyone in the country thinks that her medal is equivalent to a gold medal
2941653 lo and behold all 2000 copies sold out and boating nz got a hold of it and serialised it and before i knew it one of the publishers was banging on my door asking if id like to write a sequel
2941654 big aggie was simpler than the crucial gene because i could hit my target audience i knew it was yachties whereas general fiction is difficult
2941655 i wanted to write all my life its one of those things you almost cant afford to do in new zealand because its so poorly paid
2941656 coincidentally when i retired there was an outbreak of sars we were quite worried about that and my wife and i cancelled our annual trip back to england
2941657 i started thinking god if this starts to get out of control what are we going to do how do you protect yourself
2941658 i am a pom by accident of birth and a kiwi by choice
2941659 a lot of people have read it through the night we have issued a health warning to our friends not to start reading it at 8pm

2941697 edwards affair was media part of a conspiracy of silence
2941698 rumors about john edwards love affair had been circulating for months but it wasnt until the former democratic presidential candidate admitted to the affair that national news organizations jumped on the story after the national enquirer reported catching edwards making a late night visit to see his ex mistress last month the blogosphere exploded asking why the mainstream media was not reporting the story
2941699 was it because of a condescending attitude toward a tabloids reporting bias toward a democratic candidate or sympathy toward elizabeth edwards who is battling an incurable form of cancer
2941700 david carr a columnist for the new york times said many news organizations
2941701 they have been very right about some things but theres been some misses too so its a little scary to follow on those stories
2941702 its also a little scary for big outfits to step up on a story like this sex may sell but it can really hurt your relationship with readers
2941703 asked by cnns howard kurtz if sympathy for elizabeth edwards played any part in an apparent reluctance to report the story abc correspondent kate snow said no
2941704 we at abc were working on this story and if we had had any proof and any verifiable facts we certainly would have gone with the story
2941705 it was just a matter of were not going to put something on the air until we know that its true
2941706 brian ross abcs chief investigative correspondent said his investigative team was pushing hard following the money trail looking at such things as who paid for hunters fancy california home and the use of campaign funds
2941707 as ross worked on the money angle his colleague bob woodruff landed an interview with edwards
2941708 until he called and its on the record that he called us on friday and said i want to talk you know thats what broke the story he was willing to admit that he had been lying
2941709 kurtz said news organizations were clinging to a very important standard dont run allegations that you cant prove
2941710 i think at that point we should have earlier than we did told readers and viewers what we knew and we didnt know
2941711 but with questions still looming about the identity of the childs father and the enquirer standing by its reporting the blogosphere will probably keep this story alive
2941712 members of the public people with modems people with cell phones are now producers editors they can push and push and push on a story until it ends up being acknowledged by everyone
2941713 it feels like our crew has this bubble around us of just pure confidence in each other and what weve come out here to accomplish

2941744 if i went out and told them to stop theyd pelt this car
2941745 in fact i had my windscreen put in a couple of months ago but what can you do
2941746 we challenged them and we told them what was wrong then they started throwing stones and bottles at us
2941747 i realised we were all at risk ourselves because these guys were all drunk and i got my car around in time to watch them all running behind us throwing stones and bottles
2941748 if we hadnt moved the car it would have been smashed up and one or both of us would have been seriously injured

2941750 over the christmas new year period and through the spring and summer of 2009 may decide to book with other carriers to avoid any possible interruptions in their holiday schedules as a result i find as a fact that the buttons will harm the employers relationship with its customers
2941751 the right to freedom of expression and participation in the lawful union activities is not an absolute one
2941752 employees owe a duty of loyalty to their employers wearing buttons at work which a carry a message detrimental to the employers economic interests is a breach of duty of loyalty
2941753 the buttons may be worn by employees so long as they remain in an area to which the public has no access to this extent the grievance is allowed
2941754 much to the chagrin of their teenaged children its clearly no longer cool similarly by the time business jargon moves from the web to the boardroom you can be sure its just as dead and useless
2941755 likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt
2941756 my impression is that all of these different agencies are treating this like a hot potato trying to pass it to the next agency and saying that they themselves are blameless
2941757 with hindsight there are probably many things that could or should have been done to avoid this crisis
2941758 i cant believe they would be so stupid its just provocative
2941759 but maybe their intention is to get rid of all the former liberal governments tomorrow starts today programs
2941760 spends 3 5 billion on arts funding and is spending more on arts than did the previous liberal government in the case of promart we think the funding choices made were inappropriate inappropriate because they were ideological in some cases with highly ideological individuals exposing their agendas or money going to wealthy celebrities or fringe arts groups that in many cases would be at best unrepresentative and at worst offensive
2941761 if they are spending more its in adjusted for inflation dollars this is about some right wing troglodytes in the party overcome with self righteous indignation that people like toronto broadcast journalist avi lewis received funding
2941762 would we not love to get that from our stock portfolios if these cuts will save the countrys economy god help us were in worse shape than i ever thought

2941764 the ontario competition has accelerated for the feds the whole question of what they are going to do with aecl and the acr1000 reactor

2941778 he is a very smart careful and loving child with a captivating smile
2941779 i was preparing dinner and yadav wanted to go to the park and i said just as soon as i have finished cooking we will be able to go
2941780 he was so enthusiastic and said he could manage by himself and ran out i heard the door slam
2941781 i asked some boys from scotch college who said he went to the park she said
2941782 we are trying every avenue of inquiry he may have slipped into the fast flowing creek and drowned he may be lost or he may be hiding from us we dont know what the story is said senior sergeant joe connor of boroondara police
2941783 he was a lost boy in india in a bombay mumbai orphanage and his survival skills would be more than that of other nine year old boys
2941784 inspiration to adopt yadav as a seven year old from mumbai and give him a better life
2941785 he was a lost child in india and had a difficult childhood that was not normal she said
2941786 sometimes he would explain to me that he got lost on a train from kalyan to mumbai and the police took him to the ashram orphanage for his safety
2941787 whenever he sees a train he looks at the train you cant explain what it feels like as a mother
2941788 we were a very happy family and already had the idea of coming here for our childrens education and had to go back to scratch and find a home and jobs ms munohur said

2941917 the council has apologised to the complainant and it has supplied him with a second bin for as long as he needs it
2941918 i am grateful to anne seex the local government ombudsman and her colleagues for undertaking what has been a thorough and time consuming investigation i agree with the findings
2941919 however we have now moved on although the chief executive of the council has to answer for council employees he cannot oversee everything completely
2941920 the chief executive has apologised and i consider the matter now closed
2941921 as regards the award of 250 i have requested that the chief executive donate this sum direct to the victims of crime trust
2941922 most local authorities follow defras guidance to be as understanding flexible and helpful as possible when deciding what is reasonable for each household
2941923 as quoted in the ombudsmans report it is hard to see how the authority can justify refusing to collect waste from a second bin especially where the resident is offering to pay for the additional receptacle
2941924 the consumer council for water together with other industry bodies asked thames consumers what they want from the company between 2010 and 2015
2941925 customers made it very clear that reducing leakage was of paramount importance and we are encouraged that thames water is addressing this proactively
2941926 thames water plans also need to take account of significant population growth in an area already classed as water stressed by the environment agency
2941927 we agree with thames proposal for a new reservoir as consumers in the area have told us that a safe reliable service was important to them
2941928 however we believe that customers will be concerned with price rises on this scale especially in light of many other household bill increases
2941929 we are concerned about the impact that thames intensified metering programme will have on certain groups of customers
2941930 customers have told us that they see meters as the fairest way to pay for their water but while some are likely to save money by switching to a meter others will not
2941931 the proposal of high price increases and more water meters combined with the rising cost of energy bills could hurt many households
2941932 london has some of the countrys poorest areas and the government needs to seriously consider ways to help those who cannot afford to pay for their water
2941933 the consumer council for water was consulted as thames developed these plans and thames did a thorough job of consumer research while putting them together but it will take time to compare the companys pricing and investment plans against our own research to make sure that consumers receive a package of benefits over the next five years at a price that they are willing and able to pay
2941934 in the current economic downturn people are asking harder questions about the quality and value of new homes
2941935 the peterborough ppod homes not only respond to climate change they will also be more spacious and have lower energy bills this isnt just about eco living it is about making new housing schemes a much better deal for owners and tenants by creating comfortable and cost efficient homes for a range of incomes
2941936 to be appointed as preferred developer for the peterborough carbon challenge site is fantastic news gentoo homes aims to create sustainable communities in every sense and has always advocated a
2941937 this scheme provides a very exciting opportunity to bring new types of housing to a major development providing a model that can be transferred to future sites
2941938 this is in keeping with morris long standing commitment to sustainable development which saw morris recently named as the uks first green housebuilder of the year
2941939 the exciting carbon challenge scheme will enhance peterboroughs reputation as a uk leader in high quality sustainable development and it will stimulate progress in our vision for the much larger south bank area
2941940 council officers are identifying new and sustainable ways of providing sustainable essential services for residents when it is built
2941941 eeda is delighted that this exciting project is moving into the next stage of development peterboroughs carbon city challenge
2941942 it will be an exemplar project which will draw on and expand the expertise of the regions environmental technology businesses creating jobs and raising skills and helping them maintain their global competitiveness in a sector that is estimated to be worth billions in a just a few years time
2941943 this development will transform this key city centre location providing a sustainable exemplar for future development of the south bank and the whole of the city
2941944 we are committed to tackling knife crime and getting knives off our streets we have introduced tough laws including increasing the minimum age at which someone can be sold a knife from 16 to 18 and penalties for shopkeepers who do beak the law
2941945 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve enforcement action is one part of the solution and that is why i am today calling on our partners in the police and trading standards to get tough with anyone illegally selling knives to under 18s
2941946 i want to see more test purchasing operations like those being undertaken in birmingham to catch any unscrupulous retailers
2941947 for some time police forces have been working closely with trading standards to address the illegal sale of knives to young people
2941948 police forces are determined to make inroads into stamping out knife crime and getting weapons off our streets but this cannot be down to police alone retailers must take responsibility for their actions too
2941949 operations such as this are considered good practice in tackling unscrupulous and irresponsible shop keepers who are willing to sell knives to young people with the full knowledge that these may then go on to be used as weapons
2941950 council trading standards teams are already taking a tough stance on shops selling knives to children and carry out regular checks to make sure retailers arent breaking the law
2941951 recent test purchasing operations across the country show that the majority of retailers are responsible and ask for id whenever they suspect somebody may be under age unfortunately there are clearly still a minority who are prepared to profit by selling knives to children
2941952 the legal age for buying a knife was raised from 16 to 18 last year and its important that retailers understand the implications of breaking the law councils arent trying to hoodwink retailers and will only use volunteers who look under 18
2941953 there is simply no excuse for selling knives to children and retailers must accept their share of responsibility if we are to keep our streets and our young people safe and free of knives

2942000 weve also had reports of eight kayaks getting very close to the station although most have now been captured three people reaching the jetty and almost getting over the fence and more rafters dropping a banner reading coal starter gun for climate chaos on a fort opposite the power station
2942001 however as we have seen all week while the majority of people have been law abiding it was clear from early on that a comparatively small number of people were intent on causing trouble
2942002 for example a group of people dressed in dark clothing and wearing what appeared to be masks were seen to cut across the country
2942003 other groups split from the march and also headed to kingsnorth power station across country some again wearing masks we believe individuals from these groups were among those who later made determined efforts to break into the power station

2942009 we had an excellent season last year and people are talking in the press about us having to perform another miracle and there is a lot of speculation suggesting we are going to fail this season and finish up between 15 and 18th
2942010 for the first time this week we had nowhere to train and that was a real concern im not going to moan about it but it was a real concern that for the first time in 18 months we had run out of people to call on for a training facility luckily we got one at the last minute but we have to understand where we are and what we are we are a continuing work in progress we have a big plan from the football perspective but it is difficult to live your life day to day in this industry
2942011 we were a bit naive in our appraisal of the promotion runners in the early part of last season
2942012 me and dave flitcroft have learned a lot weve evaluated and assessed and i feel we were a bit too gung ho in our appraisal of our own team and our ability to get the best out of the team
2942013 it did work out well but we should never have been anywhere near a contender for automatic promotion let alone the play offs because last season the budgets of other clubs in the division were far in excess of our own
2942014 this season we wont hide well stand out there with our shoulders back trying to achieve what we want to achieve
2942015 i want to be a premier league manager people may laugh at that but i want to manage in the premier league so does dave if we can we want to do it together but if we cant we both have our individual agendas so too have the players but we can only achieve these ambitions by being collectively successful

2942032 they ask thee concerning womens courses say they are a hurt and a pollution so keep away from women in their courses and do not approach them until they are clean
2942033 muslims draw not near unto prayer if ye have touched women then go to high clean soil and rub your face and your hands
2942034 if ye have had contact with women and ye find not water then go to clean high ground and rub your faces and your hands with some of it
2942035 and women shall have rights similar to the rights against them according to what is equitable but men have a degree of advantage over them and god is exalted in power wise
2942036 they ask thee for a legal decision say god directs thus about those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs if there are brothers and sisters they share the male having twice the share of the female
2942037 those who believe not in the hereafter name the angels with female names

2942040 isnt the witness of a woman equal to half of that of a man
2942041 this is because of the deficiency of a womans mind
2942042 allah permits you to shut them in separate rooms and to beat them but not severely if they abstain they have the right to food and clothing
2942043 i must also make eve bad word although i created her intelligent
2942044 muhammad said is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man
2942045 muhammad said isnt it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses
2942046 o women give alms as i have seen that the majority of the dwellers of hell fire were you women
2942047 you curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands i have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you a cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you
2942048 o allahs apostle what is deficient in our intelligence and religion
2942049 is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man
2942050 this is the deficiency in her intelligence isnt it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses
2942051 the apostle of allah said when one of you prays without a sutrah a dog an ass a pig a jew a magian and a woman cut off his prayer but it will suffice if they pass in front of him at a distance of over a stones throw
2942052 from the captives of hunayn allahs messenger gave his son in law ali a slave girl called baytab and he gave future caliph uthman a slave girl called zaynab and future caliph umar another
2942053 men were to lay injunctions on women lightly for they were prisoners of men and had no control over their persons
2942054 your wives are as a tilth unto you so approach your tilth when or how ye will
2942055 the stipulations most entitled to be abided by are those with which you are given the right to enjoy the womens private parts i e the stipulations of the marriage contract
2942056 none of you should flog his wife as he flogs a slave and then have sexual intercourse with her in the last part of the day
2942057 all married women are forbidden unto you save those captives whom your right hands possess
2942058 you cant have sex with married women unless they are slaves obtained in war with whom you may rape or do whatever you like a man is permitted to take women as sex slaves outside of marriage
2942059 if any of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women they may wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess
2942060 who restrain their carnal desires except with their wives and slave girls for these are lawful to them
2942061 it is not allowed thee to take other women henceforth nor that thou shouldst change them for other wives even though their beauty pleased thee save those whom thy right hand possesseth and allah is ever watcher over all things
2942062 force not your slave girls to whoredom prostitution if they desire chastity that you may seek enjoyment of this life and heres the freedom to pimp card but if anyone forces them then after such compulsion allah is oft forgiving
2942063 and those who guard their chastity except with their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess for then they are not to be blamed such will be the honoured ones in the gardens of bliss
2942064 if any of your women are guilty of lewdness take the evidence of four reliable witnesses from amongst you against them and if they testify confine them to houses until death do claim them or god ordain for them some other way
2942065 if two men among you are guilty of lewdness punish them both if they repent and amend leave them alone for god is oft returning most merciful
2942066 i was shown the hell fire and that the majority of its dwellers were women who were ungrateful
2942067 they are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors and the good charitable deeds done to them if you have always been good benevolent to one of them and then she sees something in you not of her liking she will say i have never received any good from you
2942068 among the inmates of heaven women will be the minority
2942069 i mohammed have seen that the majority of the dwellers of hell fire were women because they are ungrateful to their husbands and they are deficient in intelligence
2942070 i saw paradise and stretched my hands towards a bunch of its fruits and had i taken it you would have eaten from it as long as the world remains i also saw the hell fire and i had never seen such a horrible sight i saw that most of the inhabitants were women
2942071 they are ungrateful to their companions of life husbands and ungrateful to good deeds
2942072 and say to the believing women that they cast down their looks and guard their private parts and do not display their ornaments except what appears thereof and let them wear their head coverings over their bosoms and not display their ornaments except to their husbands or their fathers or the fathers of their husbands or their sons or the sons of their husbands or their brothers or their brothers sons or their sisters sons or their women or those whom their right hands possess or the male servants not having need of women or the children who have not attained knowledge of what is hidden of women and let them not strike their feet so that what they hide of their ornaments may be known
2942073 o prophet tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks veils over their bodies when outdoors that is most convenient that they should be known and not molested
2942074 such elderly women as are past the prospect of marriage there is no blame on them if they lay aside their outer garments provided they make not a wanton display of their beauty but it is best for them to be modest and god is one who sees and knows all things
2942075 o consorts of the prophet stay quietly in your houses and make not a dazzling display like that of the former times of ignorance
2942076 o consorts of the prophet if any of you are devout obedient and submissive in the service to allah and his messenger and does good to her shall we grant her reward twice we have prepared for her a generously rich provision
2942077 and when ye ask his ladies for anything ye want ask them from before a screen that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs nor is it right for you that ye should marry his muhammads widows after him at any time truly such a thing is in gods sight an enormity
2942078 you must not speak ill of gods apostle nor shall you ever wed his wives after him this would be a grave offense in the sight of allah
2942079 she should cover herself with the veil of her companion
2942080 it is not permissible for a man to be alone with a woman and no lady should travel except with a muhram i e her husband or a person whom she cannot marry in any case for ever e g her father brother etc
2942081 o allahs apostle i have enlisted in the army for such and such ghazwa and my wife is proceeding for hajj
2942082 marry women of your choice two or three or four but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with them then only one or a captive that your right hands possess that will be more suitable to prevent you from doing injustice
2942083 ye are never able to be fair and just as between women even if it is your ardent desire
2942084 and if ye wish to exchange one wife for another and ye have given unto one of them a sum of money however great take nothing from it would ye take it by the way of calumny and open wrong
2942085 and those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses for them the iddah prescribed period if you have doubts about their periods is three months and for those who have no courses i e they are still immature their iddah prescribed period is three months likewise except in case of death and for those who are pregnant whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead their iddah prescribed period is until they deliver their burdens and whosoever fears allah and keeps his duty to him he will make his matter easy for him
2942086 a man can marry a girl younger than nine years of age even if the girl is still a baby being breastfed a man however is prohibited from having intercourse with a girl younger than nine other sexual acts such as foreplay rubbing kissing and sodomy is allowed a man having intercourse with a girl younger than nine years of age has not committed a crime but only an infraction if the girl is not permanently damaged if the girl however is permanently damaged the man must provide for her all her life but this girl will not count as one of the mans four permanent wives he also is not permitted to marry the girls sister
2942087 maybe his lord if he divorce you will give him in your place wives better than you submissive faithful obedient penitent adorers fasters widows and virgins
2942088 o my nephew this verse has been revealed in connection with an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a mahr less than what other women of her standard deserve so they such guardians have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full mahr and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them
2942089 the prophet used to visit all his wives in a round during the day and night and they were eleven in number
2942090 we used to say that the prophet was given the strength of thirty men
2942091 the prophet used to go round have sexual relations with all his wives in one night and he had nine wives
2942092 no woman should ask for the divorce of her sister muslim so as to take her place but she should marry the man without compelling him to divorce his other wife for she will have nothing but what allah has written for her
2942093 men are the maintainers of women because allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property the good women are therefore obedient guarding the unseen as allah has guarded and as to those on whose part you fear desertion admonish them and leave them alone in the sleeping places and beat them then if they obey you do not seek a way against them surely allah is high great

2942095 iyas bin abd allah bin abi dhubab reported the apostle of allah may peace be upon him as saying do not beat allahs handmaidens but when umar came to the apostle of allah may peace be upon him and said women have become emboldened towards their husbands he the prophet gave permission to beat them then many women came round the family of the apostle of allah may peace be upon him complaining against their husbands so the apostle of allah may peace be upon him said many women have gone round muhammads family complaining against their husbands they are not the best among you
2942096 the prophet said a man will not be asked as to why he beat his wife
2942097 hollywood movies and tv shows such as terminator the sarah connor chronicles have been dismissed as fantastical over the years but this report based on existing research and current technological developments suggests that robots will play a much bigger role in society over the next 75 years than previously anticipated
2942098 these robot developments could be extremely beneficial in the protection of citizens and police in the hands of benevolent governments but in the wrong hands as warned in the movie robot law enforcement could be a major blow to individual privacy and basic human rights

2942108 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2942109 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2942110 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2942111 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2942112 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2942113 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2942114 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2942115 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2942116 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2942117 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2942118 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2942119 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2942120 who are open to doing something on the production side
2942121 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2942122 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2942123 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2942124 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2942125 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2942126 we want to make sure the relationship between the province and the municipalities is in fact balanced that the workload is fairly distributed and that you have what you need to get the job done
2942127 we are close to a conclusion but were not quite there yet i would hope that within three to four weeks after the amo conference that would be the latest for a deal
2942128 it is not a priority for them and never was
2942129 he was unaware the secret documents were no longer in his briefcase
2942130 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2942131 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2942132 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2942133 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2942134 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2942135 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2942136 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2942137 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2942138 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2942139 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2942140 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2942141 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2942142 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2942143 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2942144 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2942145 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2942146 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2942147 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2942148 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2942149 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2942150 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2942151 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2942152 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2942153 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2942154 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2942155 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2942156 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2942157 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2942158 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2942159 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2942160 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2942161 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2942162 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2942163 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2942164 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2942165 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2942166 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2942167 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2942168 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2942169 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2942170 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2942171 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2942172 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2942173 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2942174 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2942175 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2942176 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2942177 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2942178 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2942179 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2942180 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2942181 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2942182 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2942183 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2942184 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2942185 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2942186 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2942187 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2942188 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2942189 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2942190 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2942191 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2942192 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2942193 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2942194 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

2942239 we moeten de goede dingen eruit halen en leren van onze fouten
2942240 aanvallend hebben we het goed gedaan al was ons powerplay nog niet zo effectief maar negen keer scoren tegen een ploeg als hongarije is gewoon goed elf tegentreffers is echter te veel we zullen als ploeg echt scherper moeten gaan verdedigen als we in het toernooi willen blijven
2942241 ja er vielen inderdaad een paar lullige doelpunten maar dat kwam ook doordat wij de schutters van afstand niet goed blokkeerden

2942281 it was about seven in the evening when i was driving through the forest road to go to the town when my wife suddenly spotted a leopard a few feet away from our car
2942282 while i stopped immediately the leopard not looking the least bit alarmed crossed the road at its own pace and disappeared into the forest
2942283 we have to be extra careful during the monsoon because then the forest tends to get flooded and the animals come closer to the human habitation and attack domestic animals
2942284 the other day my colleague and myself were returning home on our bikes in the evening when we spotted a leopard with its cubs they quietly made an exit into the forest
2942285 no matter how many times you see them that sense of fear mingled with thrill is always the same
2942286 its not uncommon to have wild elephants from the nearby forest visiting the paddy fields in winter and more often than not wreaking havoc
2942287 they also love corn and sugarcane and quite often enter peoples backyards in search of these

2942335 the amount of fail on theforum com is reaching epic proportions
2942336 with the recent advances in technology a website is essentially a mini television channel
2942337 and can be programmed with high quality video what was a non linear medium only a few years ago is now a linear medium and can be used to tell a story with a beginning middle and end in a concise and informative 2 3 minute video a spa can tell prospective guests what makes it special and differentiate itself from the rest of the marketplace
2942338 that can be sent out and received almost instantaneously not only does it have more impact than a paper brochure but it can be more cost effective as it eliminates printing and mailing costs and is better for the environment because it reduces the use of paper
2942339 my companys mantra is that in todays competitive marketplace if you dont tell your story in a clear consistent and compelling voice you risk being drowned out by those who do
2942340 and what better way to tell your story than through a compelling video presentation it truly is the next best thing to being there

2942352 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

2942355 there was a building once you lose a building you lose character and history the bloomberg administration is about growth and preservation this is why we have to act fast to change the zoning so developers arent allowed to come in here and build whatever they chose i dont mind a building that is in context with the others meaning the same height with architectural guidelines but small streets shouldnt have large development
2942356 ive had botox because i want to be the best i can be and look the nicest i can theres no right and wrong its a personal choice

2942358 nothing happened when she broke business agreements and harassed russian and business firms or when the government acquired control over the russian media and started limiting activity on the part of others like the bbc russian service or when her troops crossed into transdniestria in moldova abkhazia and south ossetia both in georgia
2942359 i imagine it was a pretty horrific scene with two people getting struck by a vehicle and not stopping and continuing on
2942360 thats what were looking for once you find the vehicle thats the one piece of the puzzle
2942361 were trying to locate anyone connected with the driver were looking for the registered owner or anyone who had custody of the vehicle at that time

2942372 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
2942373 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
2942374 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
2942375 a detailed description and name for each species of bacteria are needed so that different laboratories can recognise all of the bacterial species present in the mouth
2942376 back then it was really about the prestige of shooting on film and in your mind as a young filmmaker that was what set you apart from the other amateurs out there
2942377 i was kind of really gung ho about spending my parents money and spending my life savings to shoot on film instead of shooting digitally
2942378 making a film is really about telling a story at the end of the day
2942379 and reaching the public with that story which is something ive been longing to do
2942380 it can be pretty heartbreaking when your films are shown in little arthouse theatres for a couple of sessions during a film festival and no one rocks up
2942381 the online space is a huge opportunity to present quality innovative films that just otherwise wouldnt be seen
2942382 we present films not only to a huge public audience but a huge industry audience site film festivals only cater to their particular city in terms of viewers whereas portable can be viewed anywhere in the world its a whole new way of thinking
2942383 we think of the viewer as not the end of the distribution chain but almost at the beginning
2942384 you submit to our festival for free you watch for free you download for free but thats not the end of the story we encourage you to circulate that content to your friends to share it to engage with it and comment on it
2942385 weve got films that have been at cannes and sundance and places like that right next door to bedroom video bloggers and people going out there and shooting on their cell phone and using consumer based technology for new forms of storytelling
2942386 online distribution combined with cheaper digital production tools lowered the bar for entry
2942387 if we had been starting out 20 years ago wed never be in the place were in now
2942388 they serve very different purposes and they create a very different experience each of which is valid
2942389 i really dont think that the advent of film festivals in the online space means that film festivals in the real world are going to die
2942390 the experience obviously isnt as immersive online but its often more personal and accessible you can find films that you wouldnt have otherwise and then you can maybe have a longer relationship with the film
2942391 people get excited and talk about technology progressing so fast that well all be able to stay inside every day and not interact with a cinema or with a friend to go and see a film together i dont think that is going to happen and if it did it would be really sad
2942392 non n spento n lontano ma vicino a noi felice e trasformato senza aver perduto la bont e la delicatezza del suo santo cuore

2942445 la pace non una paradisiaca condizione originaria n una forma di convivenza regolata dal compromesso la pace qualcosa che non conosciamo che soltanto cerchiamo e immaginiamo la pace un ideale
2942446 la felicit e la pace del cuore nascono dalla coscienza di fare ci che riteniamo giusto e doveroso non dal fare ci che gli altri dicono e fanno
2942447 la vera scelta non e tra non violenza e violenza ma tra non violenza e non esistenza se non riusciremo a vivere come fratelli moriremo tutti come stolti
2942448 la pace non assenza di guerra una virt uno stato danimo una disposizione alla benevolenza alla fiducia alla giustizia
2942449 chi vede come noi uomini siamo fatti e pensa che la guerra bella o che valga pi della pace storpio di mente
2942450 non pensate mai che la guerra per quanto necessaria o giustificata non sia un crimine
2942451 la religione non deve mai essere utilizzata come motivo di conflitto cristiani e musulmani insieme con i credenti di ogni religione sono chiamati a ripudiare la violenza per costruire unumanit amante della vita che si sviluppi nella giustizia e nella solidariet
2942452 non ci sono mai state un buona guerra e una cattiva pace
2942453 nessuna civit potr essere considerata tale se cercher di prevalere sulle altre
2942454 un albero sotto i raggi del sole un sasso segnato dalle intemperie un animale una montagna tutti hanno una vita una storia vivono soffrono affrontano i pericoli godono muoiono ma non sappiamo il perch
2942455 e sempre difficile venire al mondo gli uccelli fanno fatica ad uscire dalluovo bisogna trovare il proprio sogno perch la strada diventi facile
2942456 tutti sanno per esperienza che facile innamorarsi mentre amare veramente bello ma difficile come tutti i veri valori lamore non si pu acquistare il piacere si pu acquistare lamore no
2942457 dopo il suo sangue la cosa migliore che un uomo pu dare di s una lacrima
2942458 quando moriremo andremo sicuramente in paradiso perch linferno labbiamo gi vissuto qui
2942459 piangevo perch non avevo le scarpe poi vidi un uomo senza i piedi
2942460 e nel momento in cui dubiti di volare che perdi per sempre la facolt di farlo
2942461 lamore vero si dispera o va in estasi per un guanto perduto o per un fazzoletto trovato e ha bisogno delleternit per la sua devozione e le sue speranze si compone insieme dellinfinitamente grande e dellinfinitamente piccolo
2942462 c una cosa pi forte di tutti gli eserciti del mondo e questa unidea il cui momento ormai giunto
2942463 a come atrocit doppia t come terremoto e traggedia i come ir di dio l come lago di sangue e a come adesso vengo l e ti sfascio le corna
2942464 io non faccio il cascamorto se casco casco morto per la fame
2942465 ci che noioso nellamore il fatto che un delitto in cui non si pu fare a meno dun complice
2942466 per una storia damore vera e duratura necessario essere capaci di scrostare quella vernice indelebile con cui abbiamo dipinto i nostri sentimenti
2942467 sei amato solo quando puoi mostrarti debole senza provocare in risposta la forza
2942468 lamore ha orrore di tutto ci che non sia se stesso
2942469 quel che proviamo quando siamo innamorati forse la nostra condizione normale lamore mostra alluomo come dovrebbe essere
2942470 lamore immaturo dice ti amo perch ho bisogno di te lamore maturo dice ho bisogno di te perch ti amo
2942471 senza lamore di s non possibile neppure lamore per gli altri
2942472 lamore non un problema come non lo un veicolo problematici sono soltanto il conducente i viaggiatori e la strada
2942473 lamore ha orrore di tutto ci che non sia se stesso
2942474 quel che proviamo quando siamo innamorati forse la nostra condizione normale lamore mostra alluomo come dovrebbe essere
2942475 allor fui preso e non mi spiacque poi s dolce lume uscia dagli occhi suoi
2942476 ci che una donna dice a un amante scrivilo nel vento o nellacqua che va rapida
2942477 il cuore ha le sue ragioni che la ragione non conosce
2942478 le loro labbra erano quattro rose su uno stelo e nellestate della loro bellezza si baciarono
2942479 il suono del bacio non forte come quello di una cannonata ma la sua eco dura molto pi a lungo
2942480 amare mettere la nostra felicit nella felicit di un altro
2942481 lamore la saggezza dello sciocco e la follia del saggio
2942482 la tragedia della vecchiaia non di essere gi vecchio ma dessere ancora giovane
2942483 chi ama profondamente non invecchia mai potr morire di vecchiaia ma morr giovane
2942484 lo stolto cerca la felicit lontano il saggio la coltiva sotto i propri piedi
2942485 la felicit sta nel gusto non nelle cose si felici quando si ha ci che ci piace non quando si ha ci che gli altri trovano piacevole
2942486 il valore della vita non sta nella lunghezza dei suoi giorni ma nelluso che se ne fa si pu vivere molto a lungo ma molto poco
2942487 non potrei vivere se non avessi la sensazione che oggi so qualcosa pi di ieri
2942488 comincia a vivere subito e considera ogni giorno come una vita a s
2942489 lottimista afferma che viviamo nel migliore dei mondi possibili il pessimista teme che sia vero
2942490 il rimpianto un enorme spreco di energia non vi si pu costruire nulla sopra serve soltanto a sguazzarli dentro
2942491 la felicit non avere quello che si desidera ma desiderare quello che si ha
2942492 lesperienza non ha alcun valore etico semplicemente il nome che gli uomini danno ai propri errori
2942493 vivi come se dovessi morire domani impara come se dovessi vivere per sempre
2942494 la gente strana si infastidisce sempre per cose banali e poi dei problemi gravi come il totale spreco della propria esistenza sembra accorgersene a stento
2942495 la felicit non avere quello che si desidera ma desiderare quello che si ha
2942496 non arrenderti mai perch quando pensi che sia tutto finito il momento in cui tutto ha inizio
2942497 mia madre mi ha creato tu mi hai fatto nascere
2942498 non importa quanto doniamo ma quanto amore mettiamo in quello che doniamo
2942499 ci che rende lesisetenza preziosa sono solo i nostri sentimenti e la nostra sensibilit
2942500 they submitted a package and we responded by submitting our own package
2942501 its very natural in the first steps we are going to negotiate over the common ground as they exist inside the two packages if the two parties succeed in agreeing over the common ground that will help us to work on our differences as well to reach an agreement
2942502 we have stated clearly that it should come through the normal channel which is jalili to solana and the clock on the two weeks is ticking
2942503 the main question here is whether this approach is a continuation of the old approach or is it a totally new approach
2942504 if this is the continuation of the old process the iranian people need to defend their right its interests as well
2942505 but if the approach changes we will be facing a new situation and the response by the iranian people will be a positive one

2942511 een park wat zich onderscheidt van andere groengebieden rond zoetermeer uniek in de randstad de positie van het park is met de jaren steeds belangrijker geworden voor de omgeving samen met de nieuwe driemanspolder neemt dit belang alleen maar toe

2942534 weve all had the experience of wanting to ask a question and regretting not doing so when the moment has passed

2942604 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
2942605 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

2942656 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2942657 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2942658 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2942659 a z a z 2 0 9 9 0 9 5
2942660 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2942661 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2942662 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2942663 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2942664 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2942675 none of the three super states ever attempts any maneuver which involves the risk of serious defeat when any large operation is undertaken it is usually a surprise attack against an ally the strategy that all three powers are following or pretend to themselves that they are following is the same the plan is by a combination of fighting bargaining and well timed strokes of treachery to acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep during this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots finally they will all be fired simultaneously with effects so devastating as to make retaliation impossible it will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining world power in preparation for another attack this scheme it is hardly necessary to say is a mere daydream impossible of realization moreover no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the equator and the pole no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken this explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the superstates are arbitrary eurasia for example could easily conquer the british isles which are geographically part of europe or on the other hand it would be possible for oceania to push its frontiers to the rhine or even to the vistula but this would violate the principle followed on all sides though never formulated of cultural integrity if oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as france and germany it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants a task of great physical difficulty or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million people who so far as technical development goes are roughly on the oceanic level the problem is the same for all three super states it is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners except to a limited extent with war prisoners and coloured slaves even the official ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion war prisoners apart the average citizen of oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either eurasia or eastasia and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages if he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies the sealed world in which he lives would be broken and the fear hatred and self righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate it is therefore realized on all sides that however often persia or egypt or java or ceylon may change hands the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs

2942679 we urge the government to accept our 10 point plan to end this bizarre and demeaning lottery
2942680 basso e tarchiato calvo con le palpebre pesanti e la pelle che puzzava di polvere
2942681 da quando si era messo in politica diceva le sue condizioni di salute erano peggiorate sensibilmente tanto da svenire a ogni comizio la politica gli stava sfilacciando i muscoli e succhiando il cervello svuotandolo di ogni energia se non avesse avuto a cuore il bene del paese sarebbe filato via di gran carriera a spendere il suo tempo fra alberghi di lusso belle donne e costose automobili la sua esaltazione moralistica invece lo aveva portato a candidarsi a capo del governo cerc di allentare la tensione raccontando barzellette un altro argomento che gli stava a cuore era il suo successo nella vita era un uomo che si era fatto da s aveva trascorso i periodi estivi della sua giovinezza sulle navi da crociera cantando le canzoni di nat king cole e frank sinatra poi aveva fatto carriera come costruttore edile e tycoon televisivo ma per motivi che sfuggivano a ogni logica commerciale le sue imprese avevano accumulato 7 000 miliardi di debiti una decina danni dopo sarebbe diventato uno degli uomini pi ricchi del mondo con un patrimonio stimato di 20 000 milioni di euro
2942682 in tuvalu the men use this when they go away when they are going out on a boat and now when we go and play abroad
2942683 i had it done this year as good luck for the olympics
2942684 i hear it on the news but whenever i go to tuvalu i never see it
2942685 i just worked on things he came in there a little weird and i had to get adjusted but once i did it was a good fight from there
2942686 when my parents told me i might be going to the olympics i thought it couldnt be true
2942687 when my friends at school heard the news they thought i was playing a joke on them
2942688 i would say 40 percent of people there cant swim its the new generation that is learning
2942689 im 13 but im doing the same time as some of the ones who are 14 and 18
2942690 whoop na na na na na whoop na na na na
2942691 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2942692 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2942693 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2942694 welcome earthling you have being chosen to mate and sire a new race of beings with us women for all our men folk are sterile will you do us the honor mighty earth man
2942695 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2942696 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2942697 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2942698 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2942699 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2942700 the air never moves faster than 0 2 meters per second
2942701 from this side and over here you can put much more pressure on the back line and from this side
2942702 i just worked on things he came in there a little weird and i had to get adjusted but once i did it was a good fight from there
2942703 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2942704 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2942705 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2942706 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2942707 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2942708 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2942709 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2942710 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2942711 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2942712 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2942713 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2942714 my whole life as an athlete ive been working to win grand slams
2942715 as a tennis player you never work to win a gold medal but my gold medal is the only trophy that i really want to show to people its my favorite thing that i have
2942716 i need to be here to win a gold medal thats my goal
2942717 you know theres a lot of people everyone wants to win but theres only one who can and hopefully that can be me
2942718 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess i mean these athletes sometimes dont get to see other athletes in such an intimate way
2942719 its like okay youre an athlete youre doing well too so if anything its such a big compliment to myself it makes me feel really cool
2942720 there are a few tennis players staying in the village i know lindsay davenport is
2942721 also i know theres a lot of basketball athletes who arent staying in the village theres a lot of athletes in general who are staying at hotels not staying at the village
2942722 i was a little nervous going out there yesterday because you know its the first time you played singles at the
2942723 obviously i wanted to win and i wanted to do well
2942724 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2942725 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2942726 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2942727 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2942728 he covers in a lot of positions is a great lad around the place and whole hearted
2942729 he may not always be the best player on the pitch but no one will try harder
2942730 im not going to try and tell this crowd what to do its a very knowledgeable crowd
2942731 theyre the first to cheer if a player scores a goal and sometimes they show their feelings
2942732 do i want to start to get paid for surveys right now
2942733 the partnership with jamnow was a good fit for us both in terms of widening our reach and allowing us some more technical flexibility in how we present the show
2942734 our combined ability to book artists along with our video crew and jamnows start of the art audio made this an easy decision
2942735 anything in ones life can be changed or done away with in the blink of an eye more often than not we just wont allow it

2942737 well i bought an expensive womans electronic hair dryer for my mothers birthday that is unopened and well over the customs limits and im afraid theyll confiscate it is there any way you could carry it through customs for me under your robes perhaps
2942738 i would love to help you dear but i must warn you i will not lie
2942739 with your honest face father no one will question you
2942740 from the top of my head down to my waist i have nothing to declare
2942741 and what do you have to declare from your waist to the floor
2942742 i have a marvelous instrument designed to be used on a woman but which is to date unused
2942743 thats more than weve scored against him in a long time
2942744 it was good for us to finally put some runs up against him
2942745 he is i think the toughest pitcher in the national league
2942746 we didnt want to spot a guy like that strike one because there are so many things he can do to put you away i tried to be as aggressive as i could
2942747 hes also been out there enough to now to regain his delivery his sharpness
2942748 weve had a couple of sluggish games but thats because theyve been poorly positioned by the manager
2942749 when we were coming up guys took a lot of pride in representing their league you used to get bonuses for making the all star team now guys are paid so well theres no incentive
2942750 i remember my first one 1981 and pete rose talked about the importance of winning the game and the president of the league would always come in and talk to the guys about representing the league and winning thats what it was all about
2942751 it would be effective if they were here every night
2942752 no one is going to do anything stupid for a while not while police are here
2942753 shalat mereka di sekitar baitullah itu tidak lain hanyalah siulan dan tepukan tangan
2942754 look i made a hat where there never was a hat
2942755 one myth is that its associated with the particular personality or genius of a person and in fact creativity does depend to some extent on the intelligence expertise talent and experience of an individual of course it does but it also depends on creative thinking as a skill that involves qualities such as the propensity to take risks and to turn a problem on its head to get a new perspective that can be learned
2942756 the desire to do something because you find it deeply satisfying and personally challenging inspires the highest levels of creativity whether its in the arts sciences or business
2942757 we have a window into how concrete events affected knowledge workers thoughts perceptions emotions and motivations
2942758 we call this inner work life and we found that it directly influences creativity and other aspects of performance
2942759 big breakthroughs are great but we found that even incremental progress evokes a powerfully positive inner work life
2942760 in my managing for creativity course i ask students to consider how they will establish a work environment that will support the creativity and intrinsic motivation of others our research suggests that most managers are not in tune with the inner work lives of their employees nor do they appreciate how pervasive the effects of inner work life can be on performance
2942761 its very new in one sense yet the presence of creativity in entrepreneurship is as old as entrepreneurship itself at hbs we define entrepreneurship as the pursuit of opportunity beyond the resources you currently control so obviously creativity is a big factor
2942762 whenever a firm introduces a truly novel product it has repercussions beyond the narrowly defined product space
2942763 suppliers complementary producers distribution channels and consumers must often develop new capabilities beliefs and behaviors for the product to succeed creating a challenge for the innovator
2942764 montagues creative insight was to develop a folding bicycle with the look and feel of a traditional bike
2942765 but if you mention a folding bicycle most people conjure up an image of a small wheeled oddly shaped vehicle that they wouldnt categorize as a real bicycle the challenge is to change the beliefs and behaviors of both consumers and the distribution channels so that montague folding bicycles have legitimacy
2942766 as a user you tend to pick up on needs that folks sitting back in the market research labs dont necessarily see
2942767 montague wanted a real bicycle that would fold something to use for serious cycling that was sturdier than available folding models he designed and built a prototype in his spare time while fully employed as an architect and discovered that others wanted to buy one
2942768 the economics are such that entrepreneurs believe you can have an on demand jet service with fares about equal to a business class ticket
2942769 regulatory security and infrastructure issues come into play here aside from the challenges of figuring out approaches to pricing and helping consumers make sense of what youre offering
2942770 coordinating all the pieces and players not only for linear air but for the industry to get off the ground is an interesting creative challenge for the entrepreneur
2942771 fuji experienced the same situation that buggy whip manufacturers confronted when cars were invented
2942772 the difference is that there are dozens of additional applications for the technology that fuji had developed for the analog film market so instead of focusing only on digital imaging the obvious substitute for analog photography fuji now has the opportunity to branch out into new markets that exploit its specialty chemical expertise the challenges then are first to screen and prioritize the multitude of possible new applications and second to shift the mindset of an organization that has held the identity of an imaging company for decades
2942773 as a manager you need to create a culture that will convince people to kick off the filters theyre used to applying and to think more broadly
2942774 ironically while the emphasis in these types of transitions is frequently on developing the capabilities needed to attack new markets it is the shift in the mindset of employees that can prove most difficult
2942775 one of the most well accepted axioms of industry emergence is that pioneer entrepreneurs face a double uncertainty not just the uncertainty surrounding the survival of their own firm but that of the industry itself the implications of this are that pioneer entrepreneurs have to adopt specific strategies to overcome the uncertainty with which they are perceived
2942776 for the longest time creativity was considered the work of a genius operating on her own the cult of the designer held sway with little attention being paid to the system that supports the creative genius
2942777 thats fine as long as a creative genius in a field like fashion design doesnt need to enter the commercial arena the perception exists that creative businesses can just start up when in fact it takes a while for an entire ecosystem to actually generate an industry theres a construction of creativity that involves many other actors
2942778 in business people can go only so far by doing things the way they have always been done
2942779 in entrepreneurship especially it is essential to perceive opportunities that others have not and to pursue them in novel yet appropriate ways at every stage of the game such creative solutions will be necessary for managers to help solve the socioeconomic challenges of the future for their own businesses and for the world
2942780 it probably took 6 8 months for the new folks to settle in and to stop thinking of themselves as outsiders to then associate themselves as newsvine folk
2942781 well of course we can see how the conservative family values have failed ranging from senators caught in bathroom stalls at airports to congressmen caught sending sexy emails to pages weve seen the hypocrisy of the party that claims to be the party of family values
2942782 we would also like to take this opportunity to recognize jack gillis instrumental role in the migration and settlement of the nytimes refugees a group of folks who once arrived as strangers to this community but now call newsvine home and are an integral part of it
2942783 jeez that viner is awesome i thought theyd been given a rav ages ago
2942784 uy mira si se parece a ti cuando eras chico

2942788 the product segment in india has the potential to grow ten times its current size and touch anything between 9 5 to 12 billion over the next decade we have a lot of work to do and have identified all the stakeholders who can make this happen
2942789 the indian software product story so far has been an export driven story with 68 per cent of the revenues coming from just exports of these products however going forward home grown software product businesses will surely witness an increased acceptance in the domestic market thereby increasing the revenue share from domestic sales
2942790 key parameters such as proximity of indian software product businesses to the local market requirements excellent understanding on localisation requirements and ease of adopting customised and targeted sales approach would fuel this growth
2942791 thats the good thing about the olympics its been a lot of fun
2942792 its good to send a signal to the chinese people that we respect them that this is about their country

2942818 the fact that their genetic fingerprints so dramatically reversed course gives credence to the value of exercise not only as a means of improving health but of reversing the ageing process itself which is an additional incentive to exercise as you get older

2942823 im always disappointed when the olympics are used as a venue for making these political statements on other issues and for the canadian flag to be used in this way of course im disappointed
2942824 the question is to what degree do we mix human rights and these protests with the olympic games i like to see the olympic games being about athletes about peace and harmony in the world

2942853 the nhs should be available to all who need it yet 1 300 cancer patients were denied the treatment that could have made all the difference to them
2942854 this audit shows that the exceptional cases process is in chaos and patients are suffering
2942855 we urge the government to accept our 10 point plan to end this bizarre and demeaning lottery
2942856 of course an informed decision needs to be made as to whether a patient should receive a course of a specific drug but there is so much bureaucracy in the nhs today that people are having to appeal two or three times before they are eventually granted the treatment
2942857 it is vital that patients are given access to the drugs at the earliest opportunity to have a chance of surviving without the bureaucracy there would be more money in the pot to pay for the actual treatment
2942858 the guidance also suggests sources of information nhs organisations can consult in the absence of nice guidance

2942912 de fondsenwerving van obama laat hem toe om meer reclamespots te betalen maar van dat voordeel heeft hij nog niet echt gebruik gemaakt
2942913 meer dan 90 procent van de reclamespots van barack obama is positief van aard en maken geen verwijzing naar john mccain
2942914 daarentegen is twee derde van de reclamespots van mccain negatief waaruit het contrast tussen de twee presidenti le kandidaten blijkt mccain probeert twijfel te zaaien over de capaciteit van obama als staatshoofd terwijl obama zelf de kiezer probeert te overtuigen van zijn wil om het land te leiden

2942924 im going to ask steve tomorrow about implementing the six steps to light so we can create a clean breathing space around our task force on financial planning
2942925 i have a tendency to be really structured about planning and that story he told about the manager who always asks those questions that was me
2942926 theres always a system they tell you who you are flatter you youre someone youre a 4ab7 q thats what
2942927 you know i know i can tell ive been to hundreds of these things and you know
2942928 yes you know you might not know until later but you do i can smell it
2942929 watch the ones who tell you its not a program
2942930 watch those who tell you they are trying to do something complex simpler or something simpler in the right order watch the ones who say they can see through the excesses of the rest who promise to make your workplace meaningful like you can teach a hog to enjoy being led into the gun tents
2942931 theyre closer to where they keep the brains youll see
2942932 its an enhancement to our stolen vehicle location assistance service where we can actually help you locate your vehicle if its ever stolen using the gps system in the onstar system
2942933 this takes it a step further once the police have the vehicle in sight and theres been a stolen vehicle report filed well actually be able to slow the vehicle down once the police tell us its safe to do so
2942934 once the vehicle has been located we will actually once police have the vehicle in sight well flash the lights just to show everybody were all talking about the same white tahoe thats driving down the road
2942935 once we flash the lights and the police tell us its safe to slow down the vehicle the advisor will then send a signal to the vehicle thatll limit the fuel flow to the engine and actually slow the vehicle down to idle speed which is usually about three to five miles an hour you pump the gas you can still steer and you can still break but its not going to go any faster than idle speed
2942936 i really do like the fact that no other european has won those two majors consecutively
2942937 because i obviously hold a lot of european players that i grew up watching in high esteem to believe that i achieved something that they hadnt is very special
2942938 i know i love the idea of the back nine of a major of sunday
2942939 i love it so much im actually disappointed im eight months away from the next major
2942940 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2942941 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
2942942 it was always going to have to be a part of our campaign for the general election
2942943 sure hes been in washington 26 years but hes always been a reformer always worked across party lines sacrificed his own political interests to do so
2942944 so we were always going to have to tell that narrative because some people know it but not everybody
2942945 he can point to areas where he broke with the bush administration where he broke with his own party
2942946 that part of the maverick image probably isnt going away
2942947 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008

2942949 she was church of england and a very religious woman and this was probably taboo then
2942950 there are so many questions that will never be answered im just upset she was never able to tell anyone

2942955 she was holding a case that was in a black bag it just looked like a pile of ash

2943079 i think youre looking at the possibility of a fairly seismic shift
2943080 when you have that kind of shift in registration you tend to have that kind of shift in voting
2943081 and based on the trend that would be true in iowa this year
2943082 with only a comparative handful of votes needed to swing key states such as iowa and nevada the democrats way the latest registration numbers can only fuel the partys considerable optimism
2943083 they may have registered as democrats but that doesnt necessarily mean they are going to be voting for barack obama in larger numbers
2943084 in the absence of any concrete program it means that these people are just sort of doing it on their own
2943085 it might have been influenced by the caucuses but a lot of the democrat gains took place before and after the caucuses
2943086 its hard evidence related to voting that something big is going on and that it would strongly favor the democrats
2943087 you are dealing with things around the margins where an incremental change can be a meaningful change
2943088 id been feeling like my views werent represented but i went with the big tent theory that theres room for all of us
2943089 i always fancied myself a republican and i always thought the republicans main virtue was self reliance
2943090 biophilic design is a new approach to sustainable development that incorporates the positive experience of nature into the design of the built environment
2943091 the structural the sustainable and the spiritual into a powerful whole
2943092 now we have a synagogue that adds fresh complexity to this multi stylistic stew the jewish reconstructionist congregation jrc synagogue at 303 dodge ave
2943093 in late 2005 yale university president richard levin exercised the considerable prerogative of his office and announced that his institution with its 5 500 residents 21 000 commuters and 1
2943094 were showing it can be done but our carbon savings are miniscule compared to what needs to happen
2943095 and even if you put all the educational institutions in the world together it still doesnt add up to much the answer has to come from governments and i think the major reason for doing this is to enlighten the public so that ultimately governments will get serious about it
2943096 new campus sustainability program launches comprehensive push to green campuses
2943097 the schools participating in the pilot launch cover a range of geographic locations campus sizes and type of institution including both public and private schools and everything from community colleges to research universities
2943098 several ambitious plans around the world envision green cities but such projects raise as many questions as they promise to answer
2943099 the panel judge has considered it and found that the two defendants are not returning to thailand or presenting themselves to the court by the deadline which violates their bail conditions
2943100 the court has decided to confiscate their bail money and issue arrest warrants for the two defendants
2943101 and i went every year but he didnt care he just thought it was wonderful that i liked it
2943102 i always liked looking at the animals being a city girl
2943103 weve learned you cant really let yourself get way excited because the next day it could be pulled out from under you
2943104 when they said that then we were flopped back over to well were going to fix the house
2943105 ive always kind of felt i was the keeper of the family property
2943106 she said if youre having any thoughts about keeping the place because the rest of the family has any emotional ties to it forget it
2943107 remember three months from this date good things are in store for you
2943108 eliot allen of criterion planners in portland oregon calls the idea
2943109 from a view the domes of the california academy of sciences set to open in the fall bulge out of the ground like giant scoops of green ice cream
2943110 people cope daily with dozens of changes in scale minds adapt and acquire enough elasticity to be able to synthesize such abundance one of designs most fundamental tasks is to stand between revolutions and life and to help people deal with change
2943111 the exhibitions overarching theme the ability to switch fluidly from the scale of the atom to the scale of entire cities may sound a death knell for the tired ideological divides of the last century between modernity and history technology and man individual and collective it should be required viewing for anyone who believes that our civilization is heading back toward the dark ages
2943112 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
2943113 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
2943114 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
2943115 innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
2943116 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
2943117 therefore the use of air force in the war against terrorism in the afghan villages will have no result but causing civilian casualties
2943118 weve got the opportunity to get 12 next week against essendon and weve never beaten essendon in melbourne in the history of our club
2943119 hopefully its not one of those clubs where for some reason you just cant do it
2943120 thatll be a challenge for us but where we sit its important we keep the pressure on ourselves
2943121 the last two weeks he has gone to another level its yet to be seen longterm but certainly hes just purely from volume of possession thats not the be all and end all but he hasnt experienced that consistently and been able to do it the last two weeks
2943122 i think he will continue to grow as a midfielder hes in our senior leadership group hes a very important player for our football club and hopefully hell be here for 10 years
2943123 hes been asked to do tagging roles but now with rob shirley bryce campbell and richard douglas starting to take those roles over nathans gone into another phase of his development
2943124 i look forward to the early conclusion to current negotiations on a comprehensive free trade agreement between australia new zealand and asean
2943125 in the lead up to the target date of concluding negotiations at the asean economic ministers closer economic relations ministerial in singapore on august 28 australia is involved in intensive bilateral negotiations with key asean countries to finalise tariff and services schedules
2943126 would be an unambiguously good thing for australia but also for asean countries and the region generally
2943127 australia regards the completion or the conclusion of a free trade agreement with asean and nz as being very very important
2943128 but its also important in the aftermath of the regrettable collapse of the doha talks in the last couple of weeks that we have a regional success
2943129 australia and indonesia are both working very hard at negotiating well to bring such a treaty to a successful conclusion which australia would very much welcome
2943130 there is significant room for growth in our economic partnership if we do more to remove barriers to trade
2943131 in all challenges indonesia can count on australia to work with it as a friend and partner
2943132 the talks will resume today after that president mbeki will come back to south africa
2943133 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
2943134 fourteen hours of discussion means there is some kind of disagreement if it was an agreement it would have been in two hours
2943135 officers responded when they were unable to raise anyone inside
2943136 so they forced entry and upon opening the door they saw an 86 year old man and a 71 year old woman on the floor with obvious signs of violence
2943137 it really was a shock to know they both died
2943138 ken was a kind caring man who would always pick things up and put your dustbin tucked neatly out of the way just a very nice caring man
2943139 he was a man that just would do small lawn mowing jobs do kind helpful things for people
2943140 she was a very strong member of our church community a very good quiet lady
2943141 you know those quiet people who just go about doing things thats what she was like
2943142 they were just an elderly couple that lived here for years and just went about their own business
2943143 they were a very happy couple she walked all the time along the beach she always said gday
2943144 were certainly looking for advice and information from anyone in the local area who may have seen suspicious activity in the area between 2pm on saturday afternoon and when we arrived there about 9 30pm on sunday
2943145 so the vast majority of older australians are on the pension and a very very significant number of these people have very small additional amounts of private income as well as the pension
2943146 most pensioners also have very low levels of assets in fact 30 per cent report having bank balances of less than 1 000
2943147 that represents a 30 a week increase it would cost about 1 billion
2943148 prices are rising inflation is an issue mr rudd had the opportunity to address pensions in the budget and he chose not to do so
2943149 this is a concrete course of action to deal with the challenge facing pensioners
2943150 we cant solve every problem overnight but weve honoured what we said wed do and were getting on with the job of doing it
2943151 pensioners cant wait while the government fiddles around with yet another review of whether they can struggle on the current pension we know they cant
2943152 pensioners should not be forced to wait and live below the poverty line
2943153 if you look at the quality of the squad weve got and when you sign the players that we signed in the off season you would expect to be short priced favourites
2943154 weve got to live with that but it will be interesting to see how we cope with the pressure
2943155 sydney wont have any worries about overseas players coming in and needing six months to settle in theyre local boys and they know whats required of them
2943156 pre season is pre season but in saying that weve started really well its given us a bit of confidence so certainly the signs are looking good
2943157 were quite happy to fly under the radar but ultimately no new zealand team has finished better than last and were out to change that and get in the top four
2943158 i think this is going to be the closest a league weve had so far
2943159 all eight teams would be crazy not to be aiming for the top four
2943160 antara india dan indonesia memiliki banyak kesamaan dalam hal kelebihan maupun kekurangannya di berbagai bidang mulai dari permasalahan sosial politik dan ekonomi struktur kemasyarakatan hingga sifat pluralitasnya yang sangat tinggi namun demikian india justru kini mampu menjadi macan asia yang sangat diperhitungkan oleh negara negara superpower oleh karenanya tepat kiranya apabila kita menganalisa dan mempelajari strategi mereka yang sebagian besar di antaranya juga dapat diaplikasikan di dalam negeri

2943169 americas original suburb is going green at least thats the hope for levittown new york the town that defined post world war ii suburban living when it rose out of long island fields in 1948 levittown stands for some as a symbol of the good life for middle class families and for others as an object of derision for its ticky tacky subdivisions but if officials in nassau county new york have their way it will soon be known beset as an innovative sustainable community the new york times reports that an ambitious project aims to cut carbon emissions 20 percent in levittown over the next year
2943170 will the new list of leed innovation points lead to greener buildings or just more points
2943171 ecotopias arent just for hippies anymore and theyre sprouting up worldwide
2943172 in the 1970s environmental idealists had a vision of ecotopia everyone recycled there was no pollution and we all worshipped trees and co ops todays eco communities are less crunchy and a lot more high tech in addition to using renewable energy sources these projects aim to limit their impact on surrounding ecosystems by building with green materials promoting earth friendly transportation and recycling water and waste the race for the first carbon neutral zero emissions community is on
2943173 stable state ecosystem the perfect balance between human beings and the environment
2943174 at the heart of this book is the belief that reconnecting to people and landscapes at the local level and having a better understanding of the built and natural surroundings in which we live will result in better more enjoyable healthier and more fulfilling lives meaningful lives require unique and particular places
2943175 places that provide the spaces reasons and opportunities for people to come together to share their passions hopes and troubles will be healthier stronger places and places where people trust and care about each other and the more involved and engaged we are the more likely we are to care about our communities and to be committed to working on their behalf in the future

2943180 we cant speak in the basements as they through granades to the houses and basements once they hear a phone call or talk
2943181 live near to god and so all things will appear to you little in comparison with eternal realities
2943182 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god so that at the proper time he may exalt you casting all your anxieties on him because he cares for you
2943183 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
2943184 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
2943185 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
2943186 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated

2943191 i saw her at 250 move forward and i didnt really go with her at that point i just stuck with jo and in the last 50 i just came up and turned and basically just kicked my way out

2943201 the osce has closed its eyes to what is happening here as it closed its eyes to what happened in 1992 the bishop said referring to the clampdown by the then leadership of georgia on south ossetia an autonomous region in soviet times

2943207 i need to convey that on wednesday march 7 2007 early before dawn i left home full of responsibility for the job that i cherish as a pilot he said
2943208 there was not even the tiniest intention in me at that time to deliberately execute my job carelessly and irresponsibly
2943209 i would be happy if i could help all passengers reach their destinations safely this is what ive been doing successfully in my 22 year career as a pilot
2943210 despite my intentions there was the accident which caused victims
2943211 heavy burden for him and his family who had already suffered the freezing of his flying licence his unemployment and harsh community opinion
2943212 i feel proud of my profession as a pilot and this job is the only source of income for my family marwoto said
2943213 my family and i feel very sad and struck that this incident has been considered a crime and i have been charged
2943214 im sad that all my efforts to save this flight mission has become grounds for charges which say that i was deliberately negligent
2943215 terrorists responsible for the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks when commercial jets were flown into new yorks world trade centre
2943216 after we carefully read the prosecutors indictment in this case the blurring of the indictment material especially in the formulation of the charges is obvious he told the court
2943217 not the authority of the criminal court to resolve the case and it should be handled by a special aviation court
2943218 the indictment made by the prosecutor is inaccurate unclear and incomplete and there is a mistake in the application fo the law assegaf said
2943219 we consider the indictment does not have any significant grounds as a starting point to be examined in this court so it is proper and feasible that the indictment be aborted or at least stated as being unacceptable
2943220 and the word of god increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith
2943221 then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
2943222 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanseus from all unrighteousness
2943223 god if youll forgive all my sins i take youas lord of my heart and ill serve you the rest of my life
2943224 for whosoever shall call upon the name of thelord shall be saved
2943225 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness ofsins according to the riches of his grace for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not ofyourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
2943226 who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then forthe peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself
2943227 but this man jesus after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand ofgod from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hathperfected for ever them that are sanctified
2943228 now where remission of these is there is no moreoffering for sin

2943286 i wanted to leave when i was a reserve because when youre young if you dont play your talents can dissipate
2943287 people said i played better as a substitute and gave me this nickname but there can be times when you dont perform well when you start a match
2943288 i would love to play for a side in those leagues because they mostly play with two strikers up front and that maximises the opportunities to score in a match

2943351 but clearly there is a lot of execution work that needs to happen with our younger players to provide the depth we are doing to need so i think thats going to be our focus through the early part of next week is trying to get our younger players caught up who we are going to need to play a role in our depth
2943352 we saw a lot of young linebackers and secondary players and so there is going to be some pretty critical decisions made as you watch maybe monday or tuesdays practice as to players that might have moved up or down the depth chart
2943353 our focus now is trying to look at contingencies based on injury et cetera and saturday was a great chance to do that and i am not as comfortable as i was with possibly some of our depth
2943354 there is a genuine concern as to the impact on the olympics given the work i know was going on with regard to integrated ticketing for events and travel

2943429 we would move from room to room and touch the hearts of ghanaians in a manner they would never forget we would appeal to their emotions in a way that would make it impossible for them to resist voting for nana akufo addo
2943430 that is a very defeatist statement to have come from the ndc and no serious political party would back track retreat and flee in the middle of a voter registration exercise unless that party has seen early signs of losing the election
2943431 i am shocked that the ndc has suddenly decided to disenfranchise ghanaians though they were earlier bragging that they had people who would go out there and register they have not seen anything yet
2943432 the ndc is visibly scared at the number of young eligible voters who have shown clear signs that they belong to the npp they should realise that what they are doing is an attempt to disenfranchise ghanaians
2943433 anytime an npp branded vehicle passes by a registration centre you need to see the response from the queues they immediately start the kangaroo dance to show that they are joining us to move forward
2943434 the people in the queue may not necessarily be in our party colours but they are people we have convinced to go and register and our feed back shows that the majority of the youth that just turned 18 are for us

2943457 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever
2943458 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body

2943461 you do this you do that this reading is over
2943462 reincarnationists do not seem to want to consider the logical explanations for their experiences which are sometimes as little as feeling drawn to a place etc does anyone really consider this their proof of a past life
2943463 if things were so great up there then why are we so screwed up as people down here
2943464 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever

2943466 you probably have no idea what you are talking about
2943467 spirits are giving you impressions of their past its not you remembering
2943468 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
2943469 when i reached the spirit world i found such glory and happiness and beauty that i now realize this little earth is a grammar school not a university or even a high school it is only the first lesson of life
2943470 you can learn in one day here what takes years to learn on earth forget reincarnation because it is a sandbag around your neck you will have it so centered on your mind that you will think of nothing else and you will stay just where you are you cannot progress because your mind will always revert to the earth again you cannot live on the earth more than once life is progression not retrogression

2943480 ich bin zufrieden mit dem ergebnis es zeigt uns dass wir bei der betreuung hilfebed rftigen menschen auf dem richtigen weg sind doch die befragung zeigt auch dass es noch luft nach oben gibt wir k nnen noch besser werden und wir werden auch noch besser davon bin ich fest berzeugt
2943481 die werbewirkung im internet l sst sich durch den einsatz von bewegtbildern eindeutig erh hen wichtig ist in jedem fall dass video und audio werbemittel harmonisch miteinander kombiniert werden um die user emotional abzuholen und sie in die jeweilige markenwelt eintauchen zu lassen aber nicht nur das hohe emotionale involvement spricht f r den einsatz von rich media ads sondern auch die f higkeit komplexere botschaften zu transportieren da die betrachtungsdauer bei video ads deutlich h her ist und via ton und bewegtbild mehr informationen vermittelt werden k nnen
2943482 in den letzten monaten haben wir bei yahoo eine kontinuierlich steigende gro e nachfrage an bewegtbildern quer durch alle produkte feststellen k nnen allein in deutschland wurden mehr als 14 millionen videos gestreamt 1 wir sehen dabei nat rlich auch gleichzeitig eine entsprechende nachfrage seitens der werbetreibenden die den konsumenten hier direkt folgen und ihre werbebotschaften in form des eher neuen werbeformats in einem attraktiven umfeld kommunizieren wollen
2943483 it was really exciting and i had a really good feeling out there and i really enjoyed myself but it wasnt our day
2943484 i will definitely be stronger for this but after diving like we did today it will make me more hungry for 2012 it was great fun even though we didnt perform as we can
2943485 the quality of universities cannot be precisely measured by mere numbers
2943486 its not a major oil producer but there are major transport links to europe through that region
2943487 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2943488 losses have been pretty sharp in the last few weeks and theres always someone looking to buy on the dip
2943489 they have a long and prosperous career ahead of them
2943490 its hard to calculate but its possible that hot money is leaving china because of that
2943491 i didnt expect to do this well i wasnt even supposed to get on the olympic team my goal was 2012
2943492 my craving for the gold was much more than last time for quite a long time i felt melancholy and had complex feelings
2943493 its the one tournament i base my year around so i hope i can play well here
2943494 it would mean as much as winning a grand slam ive won so many grand slams and the olympics only comes around every four years i love playing for my country so this is a great start
2943495 for sure hes one of the best players in the world
2943496 but he is not playing all the time so for that reason his ranking is not in the top positions
2943497 i felt like i should have today off but it was a good practice i wanted to go to the market today but we have to play so many matches 14 matches singles and doubles in six days so its tough
2943498 relax my friend have a break have a kit kat
2943499 many times when im filling up people assume its a gas guzzler
2943500 i put a for sale sign up and people go crazy over them
2943501 driving one of these disgusting beasts is like saying f k you to the rest of us
2943502 fuh2 is as relevant now as when it was started we must fight on until all are crushed into scrap
2943503 darn thing is so bright and big i thought the sun dropped out of the sky
2943504 the only thing is people hit it with their door
2943505 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2943506 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2943507 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2943508 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2943509 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2943510 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2943511 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2943512 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2943513 we expect operating conditions to remain challenging for the balance of this year and perhaps into early next year as we continue to feel the pressure from higher inflation and interest rates
2943514 the pressures of rising oil and commodity prices and tightening credit globally have created a much more challenging operating environment
2943515 we think this is a pretty serious threat and the government guys here weve been talking to agree
2943516 forget about picking and all that other stuff there is nothing abstract about making a plastic key for a lock that isnt yours
2943517 we no longer have that problem with key blanks because you no longer need them
2943518 if you have someone on the inside with access to a key for ten seconds they could compromise the place
2943519 so far police operations have been smooth in roping in suspected illegal immigrants and we have had no untoward incidents
2943520 in demanding the zamboanga city council issue a formal apology
2943521 for the inflammatory statement and for instigating unnecessary anti media sentiment
2943522 personal condemnation of a journalist on the basis of their reporting through a formal council resolution is an act of harassment and an attack on press freedom
2943523 quoted from different sources duly identified in the articles they were uttered by personalities campaigning against the controversial and emotional bje issue
2943524 all parties involved must understand the important duty of journalists to report fairly on all sides and intimidation of this kind can not be tolerated
2943525 as the philippines media mourns the murder of two broadcast journalists last week
2943526 dismayed at this unwarranted incitement of anti media sentiment by authority figures not only towards jacinto but all journalists in the philippines
2943527 relax my friend have a break have a kit kat
2943528 the problem with that is there is a large black market for methadone
2943529 clients are given their sunday prescription to take away with them
2943530 obviously if you double the amount they are having you literally double the amount of black market methadone around
2943531 it is very very strong stuff and it does need to be treated very very carefully
2943532 people who take drugs in this day and age should know the risk they are taking
2943533 however there are ways that they and we can help minimise that risk
2943534 what the bolivian people have expressed with their votes is the consolidation of change
2943535 were here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalisation and the state takeover of companies
2943536 im glad he has won because mr morales is one of us hes working class like me
2943537 i expect things to improve now because someone from the same background as me cannot let me down
2943538 the initial reading is that the political crisis and tension in the country is going to deepen greatly
2943539 what the bolivian people have expressed with their votes is the consolidation of change
2943540 were here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalisation and the state takeover of companies
2943541 im glad he has won because mr morales is one of us hes working class like me
2943542 i expect things to improve now because someone from the same background as me cannot let me down
2943543 the initial reading is that the political crisis and tension in the country is going to deepen greatly
2943544 my wife and i have travelled to reside in england
2943545 if i still have luck i would come back to die on thai soil like every other thai person
2943546 what happened to my family is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
2943547 there is a continuation of dictatorship managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
2943548 i was delighted with his first game in english football
2943549 hes got a goal threat but that was something we were aware of when we signed him
2943550 i didnt realise it was that long but weve done a fair bit of shooting this week and we did it position specific so midfield players were shooting from outside the box while forwards were shooting from inside the area

2943555 es gibt vereinbarungen die unter anderem von der uno signiert wurden laut denen die georgischen truppen aus dem kodori tal in ihre st ndigen stationierungspunkte au erhalb abchasiens zur ckgezogen werden sollen
2943556 seit zwei jahren bem hen wir uns um eine einigung die georgier akzeptieren aber keine der von uns angebotenen kompromisse georgiens handlungen in s dossetien haben uns nun berechtigt ad quat darauf zu antworten
2943557 andernfalls werden gegen die jeweiligen bewaffneten gruppen alle erforderlichen zwangsma nahmen angewandt

2943559 i need to convey that on wednesday march 7 2007 early before dawn i left home full of responsibility for the job that i cherish as a pilot he said
2943560 there was not even the tiniest intention in me at that time to deliberately execute my job carelessly and irresponsibly
2943561 i would be happy if i could help all passengers reach their destinations safely this is what ive been doing successfully in my 22 year career as a pilot
2943562 despite my intentions there was the accident which caused victims
2943563 heavy burden for him and his family who had already suffered the freezing of his flying licence his unemployment and harsh community opinion
2943564 i feel proud of my profession as a pilot and this job is the only source of income for my family marwoto said
2943565 my family and i feel very sad and struck that this incident has been considered a crime and i have been charged
2943566 im sad that all my efforts to save this flight mission has become grounds for charges which say that i was deliberately negligent
2943567 terrorists responsible for the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks when commercial jets were flown into new yorks world trade centre
2943568 after we carefully read the prosecutors indictment in this case the blurring of the indictment material especially in the formulation of the charges is obvious he told the court
2943569 not the authority of the criminal court to resolve the case and it should be handled by a special aviation court
2943570 the indictment made by the prosecutor is inaccurate unclear and incomplete and there is a mistake in the application fo the law assegaf said
2943571 we consider the indictment does not have any significant grounds as a starting point to be examined in this court so it is proper and feasible that the indictment be aborted or at least stated as being unacceptable
2943572 we are making inroads into the online market with our groundbreaking licensing deals with itunes youtube and bebo with further gains anticipated in the year
2943573 the decrease of 15 in cd sales was overturned by innovation and growth in licensing in other areas of the business
2943574 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
2943575 even if we avoid the scale of jobs fallout suffered in previous downturns the era of the candidates recruitment market is already over with people in work becoming increasingly anxious that their p45 might soon be on its way
2943576 with sales slowing and input costs rising but scope to raise prices limited by weakening demand finances are under pressure
2943577 we knew our horse was sharp but you never know
2943578 we didnt have a great post position and this wasnt a qualification we knew they were going to come at us a lot harder than last week but the horse was great its a very very good horse
2943579 he raced so well last week i was just going to try to do the same thing again try to control the race
2943580 i wasnt as concerned about the time last week as i was about how far he was going to be parked today
2943581 when i was 14 i quit school and i came to the meadows in 1971 i remember sitting on the hill and watching stanley dancer win both heats of the adios with albatross
2943582 i thought back then wouldnt it be nice to win that someday
2943583 but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
2943584 the times they are a changin marital status and health differentials from 1972 to 2003
2943585 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans
2943586 with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those socials groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
2943587 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
2943588 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
2943589 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
2943590 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2943591 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders

2943658 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2943659 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2943660 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2943661 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2943662 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2943663 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2943664 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2943665 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2943666 non operiamo in nessun modo che possa contrastare gli interessi israeliani abbiamo declinato molte richieste che implicavano vendite di armi alla georgia e quelle che sono state approvate sono state analizzate scrupolosamente finora non abbiamo posto limitazioni alla vendita di misure protettive
2943667 hanno contattato rappresentanti dellindustria della difesa e venditori darmi e gli hanno detto che la georgia aveva un budget relativamente alto e poteva essere interessata ad acquistare armi israeliane
2943668 la sua porta era sempre aperta per gli israeliani che venivano a offrire al paese sistemi darma costruiti in israele
2943669 rispetto ad altri paesi delleuropa dellest i contratti con questo paese sono stati conclusi molto rapidamente principalmente per via del coinvolgimento personale del ministro della difesa

2943692 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2943693 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2943694 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2943695 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2943696 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2943697 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2943698 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2943699 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2943700 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2943701 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2943702 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2943703 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2943704 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2943705 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2943706 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2943707 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2943708 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2943709 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2943710 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2943711 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2943712 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2943713 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2943714 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2943715 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2943716 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2943717 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2943718 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2943719 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2943720 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2943721 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2943722 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2943723 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2943724 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2943725 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2943726 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2943727 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2943728 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2943729 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2943730 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2943731 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2943732 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2943733 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2943734 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2943735 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2943736 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2943737 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2943738 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2943739 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2943740 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2943741 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2943742 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2943743 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2943745 the problem with that is there is a large black market for methadone
2943746 clients are given their sunday prescription to take away with them
2943747 obviously if you double the amount they are having you literally double the amount of black market methadone around
2943748 it is very very strong stuff and it does need to be treated very very carefully
2943749 people who take drugs in this day and age should know the risk they are taking
2943750 however there are ways that they and we can help minimise that risk
2943751 it is important to know how patterns of physical activity inactivity and sedentary behaviors for this increasing segment of the population differ from those of the majority native population
2943752 to reduce disparities in childhood physical activity health education programs designed to promote physical activity should target not only children from socially disadvantaged households and neighborhoods but also children in immigrant families
2943753 were trying to give her a bath like usual but all of a sudden she hates it what happened
2943754 its as if theres an electrical current in the water
2943755 just putting his foot into it makes him shriek with terror and pain and he pulls his foot up high away from the water until i take him out of the bathroom
2943756 i can get soap in my eyes i can bonk my little head on the side or on the faucet if i have a scrape or a cut it hurts in the bath and i cant always figure out why or how to tell dad about it then theres this weird wall between me and the outside and im not allowed to just jump in and out if i get nervous and when the water gets sucked down into the drain i wonder will i fit down that thing am i going to get sucked down there too
2943757 i know youre afraid of the bath and im willing to do whatever i can to help you through this time i know that one day youll like it again but for now well take it at your pace
2943758 initially i was a bit uncomfortable with a high tech grave but now i have come to see it positively

2943760 unfortunately the trend is only set to grow in the worsening economic climate
2943761 with the price of rental accommodation going up at the rate it is and the scarcity of rental accommodation landlords are putting a blanket no pets policy across the board which is really unfortunate

2943789 there is some ability among the second and third string players
2943790 but clearly there is a lot of execution work that needs to happen with our younger players to provide the depth we are doing to need so i think thats going to be our focus through the early part of next week is trying to get our younger players caught up who we are going to need to play a role in our depth
2943791 we saw a lot of young linebackers and secondary players and so there is going to be some pretty critical decisions made as you watch maybe monday or tuesdays practice as to players that might have moved up or down the depth chart
2943792 our focus now is trying to look at contingencies based on injury et cetera and saturday was a great chance to do that and i am not as comfortable as i was with possibly some of our depth
2943793 we were a little wound up a little sped up and they came out hitting from all angles
2943794 just as loud if not louder than they did for china
2943795 i thought it would be more one sided but it was really mixed
2943796 well when the president does it that means that it is not illegal
2943797 well when tag larkin does it that means that it is not illegal
2943798 it was just beyond imaginable words cant express how i felt playing out there it was just a great way to kick off the olympics for me for my teammates to get a win the way they did
2943799 first half was just jitters and anxiousness to get out there and get started
2943800 we knew it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams we just calmed down and played a lot better basketball
2943801 you have to dunk they have three 7 footers i dont know what your definition of showing off is that was hard basketball

2943809 ive been given the keys to a car thats just been tuned up and everybody else has been just pushing it around
2943810 we also have it should be remembered a growing population in london and the south east
2943811 we have we estimate about 380 000 more people coming in to the region and we have to make sure that our infrastructure our networks our treatment works are all ready to cope with that influx of people
2943812 i need to convey that on wednesday march 7 2007 early before dawn i left home full of responsibility for the job that i cherish as a pilot he said
2943813 there was not even the tiniest intention in me at that time to deliberately execute my job carelessly and irresponsibly
2943814 i would be happy if i could help all passengers reach their destinations safely this is what ive been doing successfully in my 22 year career as a pilot
2943815 despite my intentions there was the accident which caused victims
2943816 heavy burden for him and his family who had already suffered the freezing of his flying licence his unemployment and harsh community opinion
2943817 i feel proud of my profession as a pilot and this job is the only source of income for my family marwoto said
2943818 my family and i feel very sad and struck that this incident has been considered a crime and i have been charged
2943819 im sad that all my efforts to save this flight mission has become grounds for charges which say that i was deliberately negligent

2943821 after we carefully read the prosecutors indictment in this case the blurring of the indictment material especially in the formulation of the charges is obvious he told the court
2943822 not the authority of the criminal court to resolve the case and it should be handled by a special aviation court
2943823 the indictment made by the prosecutor is inaccurate unclear and incomplete and there is a mistake in the application fo the law assegaf said
2943824 we consider the indictment does not have any significant grounds as a starting point to be examined in this court so it is proper and feasible that the indictment be aborted or at least stated as being unacceptable

2943947 the mindless slaughter is being conducted by a russian military that seeks to reassert itself not only in the former soviet union but also to extend its reach throughout what used to be the former soviet union in an attempt to fold back into the russian empire those countries that have broken away from it most notably georgia
2943948 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2943949 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2943950 russian agression must not go unanswered its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states

2943962 it is clear that russias current leadership is bent on restoring a neocolonial form of control over the entire space once governed by moscow
2943963 when this failed the kremlin turned its attention to south ossetia ordering its proxies there to escalate attacks on georgian positions
2943964 my government answered with a unilateral cease fire the separatists began attacking civilians and russian tanks pierced the georgian border we had no choice but to protect our civilians and restore our constitutional order
2943965 yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia
2943966 and above all it is a war over the kind of europe our children will live in let us be frank this conflict is about the future of freedom in europe
2943967 no country of the former soviet union has made more progress toward consolidating democracy eradicating corruption and building an independent foreign policy than georgia
2943968 worked hard to peacefully bring abkhazia and south ossetia back into the georgian fold on terms that would fully protect the rights and interests of the residents of these territories
2943969 while we appealed to residents of abkhazia and south ossetia with our vision of a common future moscow increasingly took control of the separatist regimes
2943970 the kremlin even appointed russian security officers to arm and administer the self styled separatist governments
2943971 if georgia falls this will also mean the fall of the west in the entire former soviet union and beyond

2944038 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2944039 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2944040 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2944041 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2944042 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2944043 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2944044 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2944058 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions
2944059 apart from being the poet of the palestinian wound which is hurting all arabs and all honest people in the world he is a master poet
2944060 this great figure whose poetry which reflects nostalgia and liberty speaks to us all
2944061 mahmoud darwish knew how to express the attachment of an entire people to its land and the absolute desire for peace his message which calls for coexistence will continue to resonate and will eventually be heard
2944062 the palestinian question in mahmoud darwishs poetry was no longer a legend but the story of people made of flesh blood and feelings
2944063 he turned the palestinian cause into songs that transcended the cause and all other arab issues
2944064 today i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun do not let the olive branch fall from my hand
2944065 with him gone the palestinians and all arabs will be missing one of the poetic and cultural symbols in the modern history
2944066 now that youre here i can tell you that im a bit of a slave driver
2944067 the point is to give people an experience they wouldnt be able to get anywhere else something they can carry away with them and leave thinking that was fantastic
2944068 im looking for people who are ambitious and want to discover their own potential but are also willing to use the skills they already have
2944069 telling people that youve worked with wolves sounds quite cool but when youre actually there with them its difficult to forget that these animals have the ability to decimate your body
2944070 the second you get here you notice the absence of a safety net
2944071 all the stuff you take for granted at home the comforts of suburbia police hospitals you dont have out here but youre also surrounded by nature so theres nothing and everything at the same time
2944072 i see it as a park which people can visit and spend as much time as they want wandering around and communing with the animals
2944073 i see beautiful pathways ponds and fountains but i want to make it educational too it should be a place where people can come camp out and stay for the weekend interacting with wildlife that they wouldnt see anywhere else

2944095 the flexible stent handled both stenoses and occlusions in the femoro popliteal artery segment as well as i had hoped with excellent immediate appearances following deployment
2944096 overall i felt the stent and delivery system performed very well in the acute phase and i await the longer term follow up in these patients with great interest
2944097 we believe the flexstent represents a true third generation sfa pop stent and delivery system that can significantly improve patient care in the high growth peripheral vascular segment
2944098 given the results of this study we intend to pursue a comprehensive regulatory and commercial development strategy
2944099 the decision to suspend enrollment in this clinical trial is based solely on the results reported in a recently published study comparing laser treatment and intravitreal injections of ta
2944100 we believe the data from the phase i and phase iib clinical trials generated to date provide support for the tolerability profile of i vation ta and more generally that of the i vation sustained delivery platform
2944101 when health care providers tell patients to watch their carbs eat more fiber or to avoid saturated fats most people dont know where to start
2944102 myfoodadvisor takes the guesswork out of that this tool appeals to so many looking for nutrition information people with diabetes because of the consistent portions of carbohydrates and proteins people with or at risk for heart disease because of the option to search by fiber sodium and saturated fats and people with kidney disease because potassium and phosphorous information is included which is not listed on standard nutrition labels
2944103 sometimes the low fat version of our favorite foods contains more sugar or sodium than the regular version or the sugar free contains more trans and saturated fat
2944104 it is a good idea to have the total picture before making a decision at the grocery store
2944105 lets say for example you are trying to watch the amount of carbohydrates you eat but also trying to increase your fiber intake
2944106 you can search for recipes that meet both of those needs
2944107 if one person in the family has type 2 diabetes or heart disease chances are there are others around the dinner table who could be at risk as well
2944108 myfoodadvisor can help to implement healthier food choices for the entire family

2944110 we were surprised by the fact that in some cases bugs may be unable to survive in shallow water but we did discover they can safely dive as deep as 30 metres
2944111 we are very excited by these latest results as they underscore the early detection power that is achievable when combining advanced detection techniques with a dna target rich environment like stool
2944112 although this technology is still at the very early stages of development the results of this latest study suggest that stool which is in immediate contact with the colorectal cancers and polyps is the more reliable and robust source of mutated dna when compared to blood plasma for detecting early stage colorectal cancer an essential characteristic for a mass screening test
2944113 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
2944114 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
2944115 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
2944116 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
2944117 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
2944118 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
2944119 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake

2944121 a complete neanderthal mitochondrial genome sequence determined by high throughput sequencing

2944123 this exciting result from the neanderthal genome project gives us a tantalizing look at the types of human evolutionary questions the community will be able to answer with a complete neanderthal genome sequence

2944125 the hepdirect technology has shown significant promise in delivering the activated form of certain antiviral nucleosides to the liver and therefore has the potential to both enhance the antiviral activity of these nucleosides as well as to lower the effective dose a partnership with roche enables metabasis and roche to combine their respective strengths in liver targeting and hepatitis c research with the hope that this combination will lead to a drug candidate for hcv in the near future
2944126 we are very pleased to form this alliance with roche a global healthcare company that is a leader in the discovery and development of drugs and tests for hcv
2944127 evidence of the ability of our hepdirect technology to target drugs to the liver has been seen with the three internally generated product candidates that we have put in the clinic that employ this technology as evidenced by this collaboration the hepdirect technology platform has garnered considerable attention within the pharmaceutical industry over the past several years this collaboration is just one of several business development initiatives that we are currently pursuing with respect to metabasis many assets
2944128 this survey shows that people still do not understand why it is so important to call 999 at the very first sign of a possible heart attack every second counts when you are having a heart attack and calling the emergency services immediately means you are much more likely to survive
2944129 a heart attack occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to the heart muscle most people who die do so in the first few minutes because of an unstable heart rhythm properly trained ambulance staff and first responders can deal with this life threatening emergency and increase your chance of reaching the hospital in time to receive the necessary treatment to restore the blood supply to your heart
2944130 i had a heart attack just six weeks ago my heart stopped in the ambulance and i had just minutes to spare i never considered myself at risk of a heart attack at my age and dying would have been a massive tragedy for my young family im backing the bhfs heart attack awareness day as it will help to save the lives of future heart attack victims by showing them how to recognise the symptoms
2944131 unfortunately many people are not aware that they are having a heart attack its important that people find out more about more about the symptoms of this serious health issue
2944132 people often delay calling us which loses valuable time ultimately putting their heart and life at risk we understand that making the call to emergency services as soon as you experience these symptoms should be your first call to action which is why this campaign is so important
2944133 heres why pr should take the lead on this campaign and heres how we can coordinate with advertising
2944134 this is really all about generating word of mouth lets start with a strong engagement i e digital influence program online and then layer in advertising public relations and even crm to drive wom upwards
2944135 it would be hard for my little kapit n to have to grow up in a strange family i will keep him with me
2944136 all i ask of god is that i soon may die i am now quite without hope in the world
2944137 you have no right to say such things martin we cannot judge gods ways not our reasoning but gods will decides if god willed that your son should die and you should live it must be best so as to your despair that comes because you wish to live for your own happiness
2944138 he gives you life and you must live for him when you have learnt to live for him you will grieve no more and all will seem easy to you
2944139 how one may live for god has been shown us by christ can you read then buy the gospels and read them there you will see how god would have you live you have it all there
2944140 glory to thee glory to thee o lord thy will be done
2944141 to him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also give to every man that asketh thee and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise
2944142 and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them i will shew you to whom he is like he is like a man which built an house and digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great
2944143 is my house built on the rock or on sand if it stands on the rock it is well it seems easy enough while one sits here alone and one thinks one has done all that god commands but as soon as i cease to be on my guard i sin again still i will persevere it brings such joy help me o lord
2944144 and turning to the woman he said unto simon seest thou this woman i entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath wetted my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair thou gavest me no kiss but she since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but she hath anointed my feet with ointment
2944145 he gave no water for his feet gave no kiss his head with oil he did not anoint
2944146 he must have been like me that pharisee he too thought only of himself how to get a cup of tea how to keep warm and comfortable never a thought of his guest he took care of himself but for his guest he cared nothing at all yet who was the guest the lord himself if he came to me should i behave like that
2944147 martin martin look out into the street to morrow for i shall come
2944148 step nitch comes to clear away the snow and i must needs imagine its christ coming to visit me old dotard that i am
2944149 what if i called him in and gave him some tea
2944150 and warm yourself a bit im sure you must be cold
2944151 ill wipe up the floor its all in the days work come friend sit down and have some tea
2944152 am i expecting any one well now im ashamed to tell you it isnt that i really expect any one but i heard something last night which i cant get out of my mind whether it was a vision or only a fancy i cant tell you see friend last night i was reading the gospel about christ the lord how he suffered and how he walked on earth you have heard tell of it i dare say
2944153 but im an ignorant man and not able to read
2944154 well you see i was reading of how he walked on earth i came to that part you know where he went to a pharisee who did not receive him well well friend as i read about it i thought now that man did not receive christ the lord with proper honor suppose such a thing could happen to such a man as myself i thought what would i not do to receive him but that man gave him no reception at all well friend as i was thinking of this i began to doze and as i dozed i heard some one call me by name i got up and thought i heard someone whispering expect me i will come to morrow this happened twice over and to tell you the truth it sank so into my mind that though i am ashamed of it myself i keep on expecting him the dear lord
2944155 you have given me food and comfort both for soul and body
2944156 youre very welcome come again another time i am glad to have a guest
2944157 why do you stand out there with the baby in the cold come inside you can wrap him up better in a warm place come this way
2944158 there sit down my dear near the stove warm yourself and feed the baby
2944159 oh i havent got any milk i have eaten nothing myself since early morning
2944160 sit down and eat my dear and ill mind the baby why bless me ive had children of my own i know how to manage them
2944161 they sent my husband somewhere far away eight months ago and i have heard nothing of him since i had a place as cook till my baby was born but then they would not keep me with a child for three months now i have been struggling unable to find a place and ive had to sell all i had for food i tried to go as a wet nurse but no one would have me they said i was too starved looking and thin now i have just been to see a tradesmans wife a woman from our village is in service with her and she has promised to take me i thought it was all settled at last but she tells me not to come till next week it is far to her place and i am fagged out and baby is quite starved poor mite fortunately our landlady has pity on us and lets us lodge free else i dont know what we should do
2944162 though its a worn out old thing it will do to wrap him up in
2944163 the lord bless you friend surely christ must have sent me to your window else the child would have frozen it was mild when i started but now see how cold it has turned surely it must have been christ who made you look out of your window and take pity on me poor wretch
2944164 it is quite true it was he made me do it it was no mere chance made me look out
2944165 i did not take it what are you beating me for let me go

2944168 and dont do it another time i saw you take the apple
2944169 he ought to be whipped so that he should remember it for a week
2944170 thats our way but its not gods way if he should be whipped for stealing an apple what should be done to us for our sins
2944171 or else we shall not be forgiven forgive every one and a thoughtless youngster most of all
2944172 i have had seven of them myself and only one daughter is left

2944216 i thought rio gave an extemporary display of centre back play
2944217 he intercepted every ball that came towards him and he broke out of defence so many times with comfort it was an absolutely magnificent performance
2944218 in that kind of form i think he is approaching the best centre back in the world by far he is an absolutely magnificent player
2944219 and now that hes getting to that stage of 30 years of age hes got the experience and the potential and the potential is being filled in a big way
2944220 rio is third in line simply because of his age

2944224 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2944225 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2944226 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2944227 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2944228 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2944229 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2944230 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2944231 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2944252 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
2944253 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
2944254 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle

2944285 something different than that young boy who grew up in a small town in north carolina
2944286 because that young boy would never have done this never thought about doing it
2944287 my first reaction was of all the people not john edwards
2944288 he just fell into a trap that we can all fall into
2944289 i would treat him no differently but he would be snubbed by some people
2944290 no matter what your party affiliation if someone from your town is successful you hate
2944291 to be involved in something like this my heart goes out to his wife
2944292 that would really be a power trip that really would
2944293 i think almost anyone would kind of lose sight of reality

2944303 before the race we all knew the way the french had swum in the prelims that when they added their best two guys it was going to be a tight race they had talked a lot about it and we would just rather do it in the pool they pulled that time off without their best two guys
2944304 i knew it was going to come down to the end and i was hoping to be ahead but i never lost hope
2944305 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50

2944331 when you consider how many people are affected by hiv and aids it makes you realise that while there have been huge medical breakthroughs in treatment we still need to keep
2944332 we have a fantastic opportunity to do this with malachys storyline as its a relevant and very much a real life issue
2944333 before reading the scripts i was unaware of the medical developments made to help people living with hiv
2944334 i am absolutely thrilled and overwhelmed with the amazing response from the public and the critics for the railway children
2944335 it has been a wonderful experience teaming up with the national railway museum and for me its been wonderful seeing generations of families coming together for what is a truly magical experience
2944336 we have had people from all over the country coming to see this wonderful production and there are still plenty of tickets left for what many people are saying is the event of the summer dont miss out on a once in a lifetime opportunity
2944337 stirling single the real locomotive starring in the railway children is undoubtedly the largest leading lady ever to take to the stage and its great to see this new adaptation of the classic childrens story breathe life into items from the national collection
2944338 this has been such an exciting new venture for us and has hopefully opened the doors for more ventures of this kind

2944349 this is the first study in europeans to show a beneficial association on wet amd from the consumption of oily fish and is consistent with results from studies in the usa and australia two 3oz servings a week of oily fish such as salmon tuna or mackerel provides about 500 mg of dha and epa per day
2944350 this complicated network of causation has confounded efforts to understand cd says carol nacy ph
2944351 since among other things multiple studies identified the pathogen in tissues of cd patients treating some of these patients with antibiotics that target mycobacteria provided relief from symptoms
2944352 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
2944353 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
2944354 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
2944355 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
2944356 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
2944357 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
2944358 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
2944359 i have frozen them for 12 hours at a time and about 50 percent of them survive
2944360 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
2944361 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
2944362 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
2944363 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
2944364 a detailed description and name for each species of bacteria are needed so that different laboratories can recognise all of the bacterial species present in the mouth
2944365 tpa has been demonstrated to reduce disability from ischemic clot caused stroke however the drug is only currently approved for use within three hours of symptom onset
2944366 it is important for people to recognize the symptoms of stroke and promptly call 9 1 1 emergency medical services when they occur
2944367 although patients arriving at the hospital within two hours of symptom onset were significantly more likely to receive a timely ct scan than those who did not 24 percent vs 9 percent most 76 percent did not
2944368 this points to areas where stroke systems of care can be improved in hospitals improvements could increase patients access to time dependent therapies and potentially reduce disability from stroke
2944369 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states

2944426 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
2944427 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
2944428 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
2944429 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs
2944430 we are in a tough pool and have to win every game so i am definitely happy to win this one
2944431 i had barely settled into my coaching box when we scored the first goal it showed we were not nervous
2944432 i cant be happy when we missed so many goals it is unacceptable at the start of the tournament we had seven penalty corners and wasted all of them
2944433 it makes it difficult for us now but we will fight all the way
2944434 i am not surprised we had problems getting into the game at the start
2944435 we have a young team and for many of them it is their first olympics so a bit of nervousness was natural but once we settled down we just got better and better
2944436 maye we should not have lost by such a big margin but this is the first time they are playing at the olympics
2944437 i wished it was longer than eight minutes because it went so quickly

2944447 felt by two other men and being given a hiding by another man it appeared to the social worker and the supervisor that the information referring to bruce howse was a repeat of the same information as that previously discussed with olympia and retracted by her
2944448 new information but as not necessarily giving rise to a new or immediate concern for olympias welfare
2944449 new information had still not been investigated at this time
2944450 new information passed on to me which i need to discuss with you meanwhile the case had been closed on the electronic record system on 5 november 2001 as previously agreed by the supervisor
2944451 lost in information about another child fortunately this did not happen the circumstances of the second child were enquired into the policy that requires recording of each child separately is designed to ensure a separate and full investigation for each child
2944452 new information of 3 september 2001 yet to be investigated at the very least the new information should have been entered onto the record and the case kept open
2944453 as soon as practicable to the serious abuse team supervisor this is a specified member of the police the protocol also states
2944454 reports of abuse made by a child must be investigated
2944455 should a child recant a full investigation shall continue to be made
2944456 olympias prompt retraction of the allegation of abuse seemingly genuine to an experienced social worker encouraged a conclusion that there was nothing to investigate this was agreed to by her supervisor
2944457 new information was part of the 3 august 2001 notification it called into question the retraction if it was a new notification in its own right it should have been investigated and referred to the serious abuse team supervisor

2944525 the good news is that most people are coping well and continuing to pay their mortgages in full despite the higher costs of food and fuel and the higher mortgage rates now prevailing in the market for those coming off cheaper original deals
2944526 even in their present incomplete form hips are already having a positive impact on the market consumers are benefiting from faster transactions reduced stress cheaper searches and better protection
2944527 with more consumer friendly information in packs from the beginning of next year along with the ending of estate agents marketing homes without packs the benefits will be increasingly obvious for all to see i believe the government should now go even further
2944528 the constraints on development and ownership in the area should ensure that prices remain resilient through the downturn and are well positioned for sharp growth when health returns to the market

2944534 sport cant grow if we dont have a good facility
2944535 the lack of training venues really limits the ability for sport to grow in the area and has meant we have had to knock back people from joining up because we just dont have the space to accommodate them
2944536 ballina is a central hub for the shire and already delivers a wide range of sporting and recreational activities for our community
2944537 population growth and tourism has brought with it a demand for a wider range of sport and event opportunities
2944538 this feasibility study will help the council plan for indoor sporting facilities aquatics and other recreation facilities and services over the next decade or two
2944539 it would have been nice to win the game but i didnt even know it was that close until i looked up at the scoreboard at the end of the game
2944540 lismore had it over us a little bit in the backs but we probably beat lismore in the forwards they got over us a little bit in the first half and then we adjusted at half time
2944541 they were looking for penalty goals while we went for tries lismore kicked more penalty goals but i think we outplayed them
2944542 its the first time in 10 years we havent made the semis i suppose we started the season fairly good and thinking we were capable of going all way
2944543 we thought we were good enough but we just had so many injuries and lost so many key players that by the third or fourth round we knew wed be struggling
2944544 so weve had a reasonably long time to get used to the idea that we were not going to make it
2944545 really what we do each week is sit down with the reserve players and ask any of them to play up and any of the under 19s players if they want to play up
2944546 we wont demand that they play up we just ask and they put their hands up they are just so keen
2944547 we could have as many as four players retire this year and the younger players are playing on the basis that there will be first grade spots available next year

2944558 it can happen just like that maybe because of an argument with friends or financial problems
2944559 it is hard to get a place to rent the agents have such full on requirements if there was cheaper accommodation there would be fewer people camping out
2944560 unfortunately in order to satisfy the combined requirements of our joint partners it will not be possible to complete the project this year
2944561 we are currently investigating site issues and formulating a workable operational model for a 24 7 facility
2944562 the stakeholder agencies are disappointed with the delay but they acknowledge that more research and negotiation are necessary if the project is to move forward
2944563 for some it is very disappointing but in saying that people realise taking the time to get it right is going to be better in the end

2944566 it was quite tense because we were in 5th place at the first mark and if we had stayed there we would not have won overall
2944567 we have taken this very seriously we are professional sailors so treated it as part of our training programme and feel that we made a clear progression it has been a fantastic regatta and we are really pleased to have won
2944568 the crew are pretty disappointed but it was all my fault
2944569 my tactician advised me not to put it up because we were in the lead and only needed to stay in front of amey love shack to win the overall prize but i wanted to put it up for a bit of fun
2944570 this was not in the plan at all but it is very exciting
2944571 if they win tomorrow and we come second we win overall if they win and we come third they win overall if we win we win
2944572 the forecast is for wind which suits us because we are the fat boys of the fleet but julia has to be favourite because she is a very good competitor shes clever with a very good crew
2944573 were still the only area in australia where a highway upgrade has been done in an urban area and there are no sound walls
2944574 its not the average that wakes you up its the heavy vehicles on the ripple strips or compression braking
2944575 despite this the rta has taken community concerns on board and will remove the audible profile line marking within the next two months and replace it with normal line marking
2944576 under the conditions of consent the minister for roads and the minister for planning have signed off that mitigation works would be required if sound levels are above the epa standards
2944577 they spent three and a half million on a truck stop that isnt used at yelgun that could have been better spent on sound walls

2944586 dear don i am so sorry i missed the boat i met a man with some righteous plans and jack that is all she wrote
2944587 i do believe this is important that we dont make what is already a crowded and difficult environment for the traveling public and flight attendants worse by allowing cellphone use in flight
2944588 wretched man that i am who will deliver me from this body of death
2944589 i have been crucified with christ and it is no longer i who live but christ lives in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself up for me may it never be that i would boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ through which the world has been crucified to me and i to the world
2944590 did you receive the spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith are you so foolish having begun by the spirit are you now being perfected by the flesh
2944591 you are my lord i have no good apart from you
2944592 you can ask god to help you to obey your parents you know that right
2944593 it was a much harder race than yesterday but were delighted both jo and i
2944594 it hasnt sunk in yet we are both so happy two british girls on the podium what more could you ask for
2944595 it went very well its exactly where i wanted to be going into the final
2944596 as the sun was going down a deep sleep fell on abram and behold dreadful and great darkness fell upon him when the sun had gone down and it was dark behold a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces on that day the l made a covenant with abram
2944597 i will make with them an everlasting covenant that i will not turn away from doing good to them
2944598 looking to jesus the founder and perfecter of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is seated at the right hand of the throne of god
2944599 if i do not wash you you have no share with me
2944600 the christian does not think god will love us because we are good but that god will make us good because he loves us
2944601 what sort of man is this that even winds and sea obey him
2944602 and we all with unveiled face beholding the glory of the lord are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another for this comes from the lord who is the spirit
2944603 if anyone wishes to come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
2944604 therefore let us also lay aside every weight and sin which clings so closely and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us looking to jesus the founder and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is seated at the right hand of the throne of god
2944605 work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure
2944606 the l said to gideon the people who are with you are too many for me to give midian into their hands for israel would become boastful saying my own power has delivered me

2944608 now that we are kings and princes we walk out in our own strength and work to see gods kingdome come
2944609 let not a wise man boast of his wisdom and let not the mighty man boast of his might let not a rich man boast of his riches
2944610 that was an exemplary performance he did not give one foul away and intercepted every ball that came towards him
2944611 rio is now the best centre half in the world by far
2944612 he broke out of defence in comfort so many times it was unbelievable he is a magnificent player he is almost 30 now and because he has experience his potential is now being fulfilled in a big way
2944613 i would be delighted for rio if he was made england captain
2944614 obviously i hope its rio as he is a teammate of mine and it would be great for the club
2944615 he is certainly the best defender in the club at the moment and it would be well deserved

2944655 michael seems to be the most powerful of the holy angels
2944656 archangels the archangel whose trumpet will herald the descent of christ to catch up his church seems clearly to be michael 1 thess 4 16 but there is no clear proof that michael is to be identified with christ himself as some insist
2944657 when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses
2944658 that the grave of moses was given into the special custody of michael
2944659 satan heb ii 14 contended with michael that it should not be raised again on the ground of mosess sin
2944660 no matter whence or how an inspired writer obtained his information the holy spirit enabled him to sift out and adequately to present only what is genuine true that is the real point here
2944661 if they dont want it i wont force it on them
2944662 the manner in which we respond to sin should mark us as believers and set us apart from the world
2944663 from everlasting to everlasting thou art god said moses in the spirit from the vanishing point to the vanishing point would be another way to say it quite in keeping with the words as moses used them the mind looks backward in time till the dim past vanishes then turns and looks into the future till thought and imagination collapse from exhaustion and god is at both points unaffected by either
2944664 husband and wife you desire to have a spouse that relates to you with respect etc is that a wrong desire no but its not a need and it can become a lust if when your spouse doesnt respond as you desire you in craving and demanding begin to fight and quarrel it is possible to live with a spouse who is disobeying and not concerned with your welfare and still have your deepest needs met because only god can meet the deepest needs of your heart this is tremendously liberating
2944665 if i was only given one point to make as to how to remain passionate how to become passionate about and for the living god familiarize oneself with the doctrine of sin its when im aware of sin that i appreciate grace the most thats why this teaching about idolatry and indwelling sin isnt bondage to me its life

2944734 and talk loudly because sometimes youre on the road and youre dealing with noisy crowds
2944735 were going over the other teams plays hes very focused and he wants everybody else to lock in team defense is key he gives us our whole swagger as far as how were the bad guys we chose to be the bad guys of the league right now
2944736 hes been the class of the nba defensively for a long time now
2944737 he just anchors our defense he controls the paint blocks shots a lot of things that dont show up in the stat sheet with his talking
2944738 doc always says im the talkative one out of the group i beg to differ i debate strongly
2944739 im just so happy to be the one that speaks louder than all those guys
2944740 you could have pretty much gone through our whole roster and picked out a solid defensive guy

2944761 so my name is a footnote in american legal history which im perversely kind of proud of
2944762 when the heart speaks the mind finds it indecent to object
2944763 if i dont meet you no more in this world ill meet you in the next one and dont be late
2944764 to become what one is one must not have the faintest notion what one is i need solitude which is to say recovery return to myself the breath of a free light playful air

2944766 but theres something john mccains not telling you it was mccain who used his influence in the senate to help foreign owned dhl buy a u s company and gain control over the jobs that are now on the chopping block in ohio
2944767 and thats not all mccains campaign manager was the top lobbyist for the dhl deal helped push it through his firm was paid 185 000 to lobby mccain and other senators
2944768 entendemos que en un momento determinado pueda haber discrepancias que puedan poner encima de la mesa posiciones maximalistas pero una vez entendido eso entendemos que todo el mundo tiene que adoptar una posici n responsable para buscar los puntos de consenso y no los de disenso

2944775 but i shall allow her thirty six months to pay that sum in
2944776 i am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that once the pressure is off there is no reason why she should not return to work
2944777 in order to raise the money she would have to obtain a mortgage but in the circumstances i find it would be a modest one which she would have the means to repay if she resumed work i accept that she would need time to re establish herself in order to obtain a mortgage particularly in the current climate i take judicial notice of the well publicised fact that mortgages may now become more difficult to obtain in view of the credit difficulties which have beset the city of london and indeed the wider world but a person with a solid asset as mrs milton has and an earning capacity in my view could raise a 60 000 mortgage which would represent less than three times what i estimate to be her earning capacity of 23 000 a year
2944778 now im going to show you four points on your body that you didnt know about
2944779 its an electrostimulation toy im going to put these blue bands on your dick and balls and run current through them
2944780 ok were ready i think youre gonna like this tell me when you start to feel it
2944781 jeff i gotta tell you i dont have a lot of experience getting fucked
2944782 when we played with junot and bart in the bathroom i was watchin ya and you were definitely in top mode and it seemed natural for you
2944783 yeah um i have a lot more experience as a top
2944784 ummm well ive been fucked five times and the last time was about five years ago
2944785 i think im gonna scratch my initials into your back
2944786 go slow pup we got all the time in the world
2944787 good boy now were gonna keep it right here until youre ready for some more
2944788 yeah this is his apartment i think he should be back soon cmon in
2944789 you want me to help you get the space ready
2944790 daniel i gotta ask you a question do i have anything to worry about here
2944791 look i dont want to spoil anything here jeffs a really good guy and he likes to push limits so just have fun
2944792 were going to get you up to about 11 45
2944793 i just took you up to 8 30 there maybe that was a bit too much too soon lets back it off a bit down to 8 00
2944794 one of the cool things this e stim does is that i can make it react to sound so if you say
2944795 good news pup weve got you up to 10 30 just a bit further to go youre gonna be able to get to 11 45 for me right
2944796 this time we are so gonna get kicked outta here
2944797 we may get some company that guy has a boy he wants to piss on in front of us
2944798 yeah just that one time but its so big you made me vomit remember but this one indicating me more headrush melting sensation is perfect
2944799 this is fine jeffs a good guy people dont get murdered in the basements of 10 million dollar townhouses
2944800 holy shit i cant do this nobody even knows where i am what the hell kind of limits does he likes to push
2944801 i brought some toys i think youre gonna like and i usually have a good sense of what my puppy is gonna like so well see if im right
2944802 dont worry pup ill make a call im sure ken will bring it over
2944803 this is good itll give us a chance to get re acquainted
2944804 ok do i know what the fuck im getting myself into here
2944805 i probably would have been interested in some clarification on that since it seemed like it was surely a pitfall i was gonna need to avoid with jeff but in no time junot was back
2944806 i bugged the shit out him i was asking him what could i do should i go into this could i do something in this field i couldnt really grasp what i wanted
2944807 i was like why couldnt i make a music video doing somebody elses songs i felt by doing that first wed be able to open doors for artists like myself
2944808 i knew it was going to take someone like him joel that has the experience with a deaf brother in law seeing what he goes through every day
2944809 so i knew that it was in his heart to help the community
2944810 for me the idea for the first video was to try to get as wide of an audience as we could
2944811 i wanted deaf people to be able to enjoy this hard of hearing people who may not know sign language who maybe rely on lip reading more i wanted to try and find that perfect balance
2944812 we had to ride the special bus to school the short one it was cool
2944813 she worked with me constantly and being in the public schools was good for me because i was able to have the deaf classroom but i was also able to go out to the mainstream classes
2944814 i had both and i think that was really good for me
2944815 i would learn all the lyrics to the song while she was driving
2944816 but the thing that probably drove her crazy was that i would keep playing it the same song over and over again
2944817 we certainly thought for the first step we needed to come out of the box strong
2944818 i want to be able to go to d pan com and see rock songs country songs all different kinds of songs
2944819 in the future we could get into so many different things
2944820 my goal is to create opportunities for deaf and hard of hearing performers directors cinematographers graphic design artists i see it developing relationships with hearing people which doesnt happen that much just like me working with joel and scott i would love to have those opportunities for other deaf people
2944821 its very time consuming as well but you just get used to it and it just works out the kids get used to it teachers get used to it and it works out
2944822 theyre a wonderful tool to help use in the classroom in todays age when children are playing gameboystm and watching lots of videos and tv
2944823 each student is here on an individual education plan not all students in a class may be on the same level
2944824 our students are being tested accordingly to what is required of them but they have to meet the requirements that a regular ed student has to meet
2944825 when theyre not listening to me theyre all looking at the ground
2944826 you name a classification or label for a kid and weve got the kids out here successfully playing with their peers
2944827 playing bat and the person throws and i try to hit it harder
2944828 i get to participate with kids that are underprivileged like the deaf ones that cant hear and have never probably played a sport and they get to finally play a sport
2944829 i probably would be a lot more involved in things than i was before
2944830 she always thought she was the only deaf kid in the whole town of springfield
2944831 i dont care if youre deaf i dont care if youve got autism i dont care if you scream crazy words every once in a while because thats in your nature
2944832 the key is we expect the same from every person
2944833 we find it very frustrating knowing others families in identical situations have had their bilateral operations
2944834 ellie has undergone nine months of assessments and the clinicians at the cochlear implant centre in southampton support bilateral implants for her
2944835 i believe the pct only considered the extra cost of a second implant not how much less her education will cost if she has both ears operated on now
2944836 we believe that morally ellie should have the operation on the nhs
2944837 looking after ellie is a joy and a pleasure but battling to get what she needs has been the worst part of the last nine months
2944838 as a doctor i did not realise the problems for parents of children with special needs this is a classic case of postcode lottery care
2944839 the second implant should really happen for ellie as it will make a massive difference to her and her family
2944840 the current recommendations from nice support unilateral implants for children and adults with severe to profound deafness however under these guidelines bilateral cochlear implantation is restricted to certain conditions including children and adults who are blind
2944841 he was so excited about today and he loves fire trucks
2944842 the program is sponsored by advocates for kids in columbus which gave us a grant for the summer program
2944843 sometimes deaf students can get pretty isolated in the summer when they are away from school
2944844 this just gives them the opportunity to come down here and you know meet some kids and some of these kids have been here for three four five years and they keep coming back because its fun theres some new ones who are really excited to be here
2944845 sign language is based on concepts its not a word for word translation
2944846 you want to move so that you can show in some way that you know what the music is like
2944847 music isnt necessarily accessible to them by any other means
2944848 you cant look at music with closed captioning on the tv or read the lyrics and figure out what that feels like
2944849 often when you see interpreters their singing translation skills are not very good
2944850 meg really listens to the song and matches the meaning not just the words theres a big difference
2944851 we want all people to be able to enjoy the shows
2944852 if its something youre not comfortable saying you need to not take those assignments
2944853 its just hilarious you have to express all of that
2944854 usually it looks way more explicit with me than the performer you can tell during certain parts that all the eyes go away from them to me
2944855 this was the first time he knew what kind of content theyre going crazy over
2944856 he said oh my gosh i can know what my children are experiencing
2944857 our business has been thriving since we first entered the market and we have recently been looking into new ways to expand our offering after launching royal vegas mobile casino last year we think the time is right to extend our mobile casino offering with another brand by becoming the first operator with two mobile casinos on offer we are taking a big step in securing ourselves as the leaders in the mobile casino market

2944888 ele anda me ligando at hoje mas n o fala nada liga de madrugada escuta a minha voz por um tempo e desliga
2944889 talvez seja karma um karma psicol gico com certeza muita coisa n o foi resolvida e sim deixada para depois n s dois somos estourados brig vamos demais e nunca consegu amos conversar sobre nada o que mais me prende saber que na verdade ele gosta de mim e eu dele s que n o conseguimos ficar juntos
2944890 a paix o tem suas armas e armadilhas portanto estar apaixonada por uma pessoa n o representa abandonar os sentimentos que ainda restam de um antigo relacionamento
2944891 por que deveria se culpar afinal de contas imaginar que a pessoa vai ter o comando pleno de todos os sentimentos passados no m nimo ingenuidade
2944892 o que mais me dificultou em esquec lo foi ele nunca ter dado o ponto final nunca falou que n o queria mais nada comigo ou que n o gostava mais sempre deu a entender que sente saudades e que o sentimento de querer ficar comigo vai continuar obvio que essas coisas d o esperan as de um dia o outro estar novamente pronto para encarar o relacionamento

2944916 this impressive residual value is critical in the highly competitive fleet market as the more the car is worth in three or four years time the lower the monthly contract hire costs whether business or personal leasing this also spells good news for retail buyers who are purchasing the car on personal contract purchases pcp
2944917 the volvo xc90 has returned very good residual values since its launch and we feel the xc60 will continue in this same vein

2944948 im very competitive and i like to match wits with other opponents
2944949 i love to talk trash thats the best part of the game for me
2944950 if youre playing a good defensive back like antonio cromartie why would the ball go through his hands and hit him in the face
2944951 ea does it because they dont want the backs to have outrageous interception stats but its really annoying
2944952 it should balance out between someone with twitch skills and someone who knows football strategy
2944953 if somebodys not here we just move on if somebody gets hurt we move on

2944985 i always thought it would be neat to have bees
2944986 i finally had a lot big enough to have bees
2944987 theres so few in new jersey and elsewhere for that matter
2944988 since then i get hundreds of pounds of apples from each tree every year
2944989 i get 20 to 30 pounds of raspberries from one bush and that is all because of the bees
2944990 there are definitely times when i do suit up and i never keep it far away
2944991 i have a new album coming out on concord records but i havent titled it yet

2944999 i requested not to go back to my old building
2945000 but there were no notes for what he was doing in the biological room
2945001 if that guy was so messed up in his head why were they letting him play with biological weapons up until last year
2945002 some one has to take the blame until then its not the end for me

2945016 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2945017 i want a job that has benefits and better pay
2945018 oftentimes if a prison is located in a place where there arent a lot of jobs but there are a lot of women that are single and in many cases raising children on their own they dont have a lot of other opportunities
2945019 it was a job with job security thats why i took it
2945020 they see the women as easy prey they will flatter you theyll listen to everything you say and use it against you
2945021 but if you stay with it long enough and you are bright enough you learn to use words a lot and that can get you out of a lot of stuff
2945022 people have found over the years that women in a male prison have profoundly had a calming effect
2945023 men act differently when women are around its just a fact of life
2945024 early on i learned a lot of the guys although they were here for whatever the crime they still had respect for women they are not as ready to go physically at a woman as a man
2945025 nothing to do but watch you and if they know they can play you they will i constantly say take your hands out of your pants pull your pants up pull your shirt up but the more straightforward and professional you are the less problems you tend to have
2945026 my experience is they do the same job as the men and i dont see a disadvantage
2945027 but im tired of struggling so much you can make so much money here
2945028 in the video game industry if you sell a million copies you throw a ticker tape parade
2945029 if youre selling five to six million copies of the same title every year youve just won the super bowl world series and stanley cup combined

2945040 ea does it because they dont want the backs to have outrageous interception stats but its really annoying
2945041 it should balance out between someone with twitch skills and someone who knows football strategy
2945042 i thought matt passed the test in terms of poise and execution
2945043 i thought for the first time in an nfl game he was very impressive
2945044 we wanted to get him in early to play against the best and i thought he handled it extremely well
2945045 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2945046 like i said plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress
2945047 the whole transfer of vacant land issue is not an uncomplicated activity in the city
2945048 if youve got 40 000 vacant lots you cant possibly need all of them
2945049 in the order of crimes what they do is way way down the list
2945050 by doing it without asking permission were more likely to win that argument on our terms
2945051 if the owner of that land youve not asked to garden has neglected it
2945052 then they probably dont give a damn about the fact that youre now going to do something with it
2945053 on sunday mornings i come out and i get whatever vegetables im going to have for the day
2945054 which in this day and time is wonderful because with the economy the way it is this is a godsend
2945055 having to go to the supermarket so much having to put out so much money to get so little
2945056 a lot of people would rather see these areas used for something good anyway
2945057 russia has applied unprecedented military power and it is of such amplitude that it would have scared much bigger states
2945058 very many military servicemen were killed probably in the hundreds
2945059 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people
2945060 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2945061 he went through about three quarters of the morning practice maybe a little bit more than that
2945062 we took him out because were easing him back in he feels good and i want to make sure he keeps feeling good
2945063 i dont know if it will be as much as the first group goes or if hell just take a few snaps but well see how he feels here
2945064 he needs to practice in this scheme but hell pick it up and be fine
2945065 i knew that the team wasnt going to be too happy with me not being involved in the optional workouts you can ask anyone around im the first one here and the last one to leave i love pushing myself working out and being here its just with some personal things going on i wasnt here
2945066 i know i just have to keep getting better every day and try to help this team
2945067 kimo has to get himself right and we can always bring him back if we need to later
2945068 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2945069 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everything is set up for him here so he can be successful
2945070 im going to gradually feed him back in i just want to see how hes doing thats my primary focus right now then well see about those other things well see where they fall in
2945071 he made it through this much of camp without a problem which he hasnt done in the past it has always happened sooner than this i guess im looking for a positive in the situation i expect him to get out and be ready to go here in the next little bit
2945072 enjoys starting at guard but if you asked him his choice hes going to tell you tackle
2945073 thats what he sees himself as hes doing a heck of a job right now at guard too hes having his best camp so far
2945074 with tra out there id rather play guard but if tra isnt out there id rather play tackle
2945075 i feel like its a little easier on your body and you get to use a little more of your athleticism at tackle instead of brute force i was a little rusty at it today
2945076 i think he could step in and be one of the better left tackles in this league he just hasnt had a chance to work there
2945077 ive been anxious ever since we got to camp to see shawn
2945078 i would be very direct with president putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct
2945079 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2945080 and theyre taking what little bit we have away from us
2945081 we didnt have the yard sale we couldnt we had nothing to sell
2945082 it was stolen and now somebody is selling it somewhere
2945083 the 15th district is so busy they are dealing with murders and everything else and this is not important
2945084 i walked the neighborhood as a committeewoman and said if youve got it take it inside because you wont have it tomorrow
2945085 nous savions que nous pouvions certainement aller plus vite que dans la ronde pr liminaire a dit hayden nous avions les temps pour nous et nous avions la bonne strat gie de course mon objectif tait de donner aux gars la meilleure avance possible ce fut tr s excitant de voir que nous tions sous le rythme du record du monde pr olympique
2945086 just unfurling a banner in tiananmen square took every ounce of courage i had
2945087 in some parts of china 10 000 yuan or about 1 400 is the price of life
2945088 they tried to block the view and asked us why are you doing this then they tried to take our banner
2945089 we said no and they threatened to put us in jail for five days
2945090 he said it was just a fluke deal and said he got it trapped under a guys foot or stepped funny and rolled over it
2945091 i feel bad for him because he worked really hard and was really going to push for a lot of playing time
2945092 theres still interest in takeo like ive been saying all along
2945093 but other than that i dont have any specifics thats where we are right now
2945094 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2945095 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
2945096 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2945097 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk with him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2945098 im going to gradually feed him back in but i want to see how hes doing thats my primary focus right now
2945099 im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back with the guys
2945100 we can always bring kimo back if we need to
2945101 i thought he played very well he was going up against a 3 4 front he had a handful of times where he was covered up when they kicked it down to the weak side this week against the panthers 4 3 scheme hell be covered up just about every snap itll be another challenge for him
2945102 he made it through this much of camp without spasms which he hasnt in the past
2945103 it usually happens sooner than this if im looking for a positive in the situation that would be the positive
2945104 thomas back spasms gives him a chance to work out there and hes pretty good at it and were going to keep bringing king dunlap the eagles seventh round pick along he played well the other night hes been working his tail off
2945105 but if i had a choice id take tackle let me rephrase that with tra out there id rather play guard but if tras not going to be out there id rather play tackle
2945106 were trying to keep winston in one spot and be productive with that spot
2945107 hes got some things he needs to work on and refine but i thought he caught the football well
2945108 i thought he showed courage against the steelers i didnt think the game was too big for him sometimes rookies get a little nervous and you dont get full production out of them but i didnt feel that way with him
2945109 when the lights went on he was ready to go well work on some of the technique things and the route running deals but he was focused in and i was happy to see that
2945110 were easing him back in he feels good and i want to make sure he keeps feeling good
2945111 i was kind of gauging him on how he felt rick was communicating with him during the practice we actually got more out of him than what i anticipated
2945112 hell pick it up and be fine but itll be a learning process
2945113 you cant get a feel for each other until you get in a game where you have to communicate you do develop some chemistry in practice but the reality is youve got to play together in a game
2945114 it makes it even more important that we get the film study in before the first regular season game
2945115 when youre out there and youre doing it at practice you get in a rhythm the quarterback and receivers always talk about developing timing
2945116 its the same when youre out there with a defensive back youve been playing with when i come over in coverage you dont even have to say anything you know what each others going to do but when youre not able to do it together youve got to get it in the film room because youre kind of forced to start slow

2945167 he has defamed the court and so hes gone for good he is quite an emotional fellow and he has lashed out very often in the past

2945175 it seems that local managements have been slipped off the leash and a blind eye is being turned to their excesses
2945176 there are people being treated appallingly and each of these issues needs to be sorted but if they are not we will look to co ordinate strike action to make sure they are
2945177 i loved going on picnics as a child with some of my favourite childhood memories being of afternoons in the park with my family

2945181 putin please please help us we have nowhere to go tsekhovleva said
2945182 the osce has closed its eyes to what is happening here as it closed its eyes to what happened in 1992 the bishop said referring to the clampdown by the then leadership of georgia on south ossetia an autonomous region in soviet times

2945189 when it comes to terrorists who have been convicted and are subject to the death penalty australia does not as a policy make representations on their behalf

2945194 i need to convey that on wednesday march 7 2007 early before dawn i left home full of responsibility for the job that i cherish as a pilot he said
2945195 there was not even the tiniest intention in me at that time to deliberately execute my job carelessly and irresponsibly
2945196 i would be happy if i could help all passengers reach their destinations safely this is what ive been doing successfully in my 22 year career as a pilot
2945197 despite my intentions there was the accident which caused victims
2945198 heavy burden for him and his family who had already suffered the freezing of his flying licence his unemployment and harsh community opinion
2945199 i feel proud of my profession as a pilot and this job is the only source of income for my family marwoto said
2945200 my family and i feel very sad and struck that this incident has been considered a crime and i have been charged
2945201 im sad that all my efforts to save this flight mission has become grounds for charges which say that i was deliberately negligent
2945202 terrorists responsible for the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks when commercial jets were flown into new yorks world trade centre
2945203 after we carefully read the prosecutors indictment in this case the blurring of the indictment material especially in the formulation of the charges is obvious he told the court
2945204 not the authority of the criminal court to resolve the case and it should be handled by a special aviation court
2945205 the indictment made by the prosecutor is inaccurate unclear and incomplete and there is a mistake in the application fo the law assegaf said
2945206 we consider the indictment does not have any significant grounds as a starting point to be examined in this court so it is proper and feasible that the indictment be aborted or at least stated as being unacceptable

2945209 spend management ist ein prozess mit einem klaren anfang aber ohne fest definiertes ende
2945210 um hier erfolg zu haben muss am ausgangspunkt des prozesses genau bekannt sein welche gelder wohin flie en und dies auf globaler ebene mit diesen informationen lassen sich einsparpotenziale gezielt feststellen und das unternehmen bzw betriebliche abl ufe k nnen so strukturiert werden dass das betriebsergebnis positiv beeinflusst wird
2945211 durch die entscheidung f r eine spend management strategie und die einf hrung der ariba l sungen hat jim polak die art und weise wie das beschaffungswesen bei ppg und im einkauf generell gesehen wird von grund auf ver ndert
2945212 was bisher als backoffice aufgabe galt ist nun eine strategische funktion die sich sehr positiv auf die gesamtziele des unternehmens und die gesch ftsergebnisse auswirkt

2945214 these grant allocations are a clear reflection of the irish governments strong commitment to the welfare and enhancement of our community in britain

2945216 many of the organisations receiving funding this year cater for the elderly ranging from informal community networking groups for senior citizens to professional organisations that offer a range of services
2945217 in het licht van recente berichtgeving over priv correspondentie van acht jaar geleden wil ik duidelijk maken dat ik zoals ik altijd heb gezegd resolutie i 10 van de lambethconferentie uit 1998 zie als d positie van de wereldwijde anglicaanse gemeenschap op het terrein van de seksuele ethiek
2945218 in die hoedanigheid heb ik wat bijdragen geleverd aan een studie over deze materie
2945219 onze anglicaanse kerk heeft nooit nauwkeurig gecontroleerd wat individuele theologen mogen zeggen
2945220 het was een griezelige ervaring maar gelukkig is het goed afgelopen
2945221 op een gegeven moment werd 80 procent van de omzet bepaald door de all star dus als de schoen even niet hip was kelderde de omzet
2945222 het bedrijf had zelf echter onvoldoende geld om aanverwante artikelen op de markt te brengen om het risico te spreiden en als er geld was geweest voor productontwikkeling dan was er weer onvoldoende geld in kas om het in de markt te zetten
2945223 onze textiel en accessoireomzet groeit gestaag het doel is om in 2010 in deze segmenten 30 procent van de totale omzet te realiseren
2945224 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around 7 p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
2945225 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
2945226 its too early to say what happened exactly were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
2945227 le facteur olympique a disparu le gouvernement na rien entrepris de concret pour stimuler le march les investisseurs d us trainent donc les pieds
2945228 les investisseurs sont tellement accabl s par le pessimisme quils deviennent indiff rents aux discours rassurants sur les march s
2945229 if you look at the quality of the squad weve got and when you sign the players that we signed in the off season you would expect to be short priced favourites
2945230 weve got to live with that but it will be interesting to see how we cope with the pressure
2945231 sydney wont have any worries about overseas players coming in and needing six months to settle in theyre local boys and they know whats required of them
2945232 pre season is pre season but in saying that weve started really well its given us a bit of confidence so certainly the signs are looking good
2945233 were quite happy to fly under the radar but ultimately no new zealand team has finished better than last and were out to change that and get in the top four
2945234 i think this is going to be the closest a league weve had so far
2945235 all eight teams would be crazy not to be aiming for the top four
2945236 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
2945237 an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it making it seem to disappear
2945238 and this is very illegal so the following material is for educational use only
2945239 it is extremely important to maintain the security and integrity of the fare media systems
2945240 with an insecure compromised system even basic revenue controls to name one example become significantly challenging
2945241 if you prevent legitimate researchers from talking about their findings its not going to stop people from finding vulnerabilities its going to stop the good guys from talking about them and from learning from each other
2945242 the bad guys are still going to be looking for the vulnerabilities and still be finding them
2945243 over 70 percent of total global emissions are generated from cities and if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them
2945244 the take home message here is its a big deal
2945245 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
2945246 if i can use some of that heat energy and convert it to electricity you can improve the overall efficiency
2945247 there are several other steps that are required to commercialize the material but were cautiously optimistic that these steps can be carried out successfully
2945248 we think we can make people feel cooler more quickly feel comfortable more quickly and that will translate into less power in the central ac system

2945255 mit seiner operation in s dossetien hat russland drei dinge bewiesen 1 seine armee kann erfolgreiche operationen ausf hren woran ausl ndische beobachter gezweifelt haben 2 die russen k nnen die von den us milit rinstrukteuren getrimmten kr fte besiegen 3 russland hat bewiesen dass sich die usa und die nato nicht in der situation befinden die f r sie ein milit risches eingreifen in diesen konflikt erm glichen k nnte
2945256 au erdem galten diese signale polen und tschechien die das amerikanische raketenabwehrsystem bei sich aufstellen sollen russland bedroht nat rlich niemanden mit einer intervention es fordert aber alle auf die meinung ber das kr fteverh ltnis in der region zu revidieren
2945257 russland k nnte dies nur erreichen wenn es zu einem angriff bereit sein wird w hrend georgien berpr fen wird ob moskau blufft oder nicht folglich k nnen sich die russen keinen bluff leisten
2945258 moskau k nnte sich mehr w nschen und sogar kr fte einsetzen um das zu erreichen
2945259 je mehr diplomatische initiativen es aber geben wird die sich nicht auf st rke st tzen desto sicherer wird sich russland f hlen

2945276 the catholic church sees the living together of man and woman without marriage as an act of adultery that is why such people are not allowed to receive holy communion
2945277 respect and fear god in all you do mainly in the upbringing of your children
2945278 it is a right not privilege for any government to provide its citizens with any available employment aimed at making them self reliant in any given society contrary to what other governments think that giving employment to their people is a privilege
2945279 you are on the next train and not this one it is in 30 minutes time i alerted other nigerians and we cued out it meant more whiling away time and possibly spending more time at the train station to help self with a cold drink
2945280 the trains here are better than what we have in london
2945281 governor suswam is doing exceptionally well and the people of benue state cannot afford to change him just after four years in office because if an administration is good there is no need to change it and benue state has witnessed massive progress and calm under suswam and the state is also witnessing series of development
2945282 some people want me to declare that akume did not perform but i will not give them that satisfaction i will not contest any position against akume who hails from another senatorial district hence there will never be a problem between us
2945283 i dont think the cause of the problem of the niger delta area is something anybody is strange to
2945284 if you have the opportunity to go into the deep south of the niger delta you will see that they have every reason to agitate though i must stress that am not in support of militancy
2945285 if the federal government can be very serious about development they should give the area the due attention it deserves not just paying lip service or dancing around the issue i am talking about human capacity building and infrastructural development where it matters in the riverine areas environmental degradation also needs being paid serious attention to
2945286 this agreement with speakeezee is the beginning of great things to come the speakeezee brand is synonymous with our service and value aspirations as you all know speakeezee mobile stores have been around since 1992 and have remained consistent in offering intelligent cutting edge services we are taking mobile retail business to a level of excellence
2945287 the decision to develop speakeezee retail brand with pnn is based on the fact that the management of pnn has shown an understanding of what the speakeezee brand stands for and what the expectation of speakeezee clients are we believe that the synergy with pnn will further enable speakeezee deliver our excellent value to the nigerian public who have consistently yearned for quality and independent service offerings
2945288 mobile technology is evolving at a pace that needs a dynamic and forward looking outfit like speakeezee partnering with pnn to adapt to the ever increasing change in the telecoms industry and bring intelligent cutting edge services to the door step of nigerians
2945289 i would say that they should grant them general amnesty so that they can be free to come out and discuss
2945290 if they dont grant them amnesty those boys would not want to come out because they would be scared of arrest there is the need for a platform to be created to encourage them to lay down their arms
2945291 we dont want nigeria to be divided we want it to be one country but if things continue like this i dont think there will be any other option we have suffered enough that is why there is this agitation they have refused to listen that is why there are militants do they think these militants are nonentities they are graduates with various degrees and they are very organised and it is difficult to eliminate them
2945292 that is a leading question at least i am glad they have survived any other question
2945293 infrastructure will boost administration and operations at the anti graft agency
2945294 the data centre was designed and built by the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc with the financial assistance from the european union eu the data centre is a component of the 24 7 million eu funded project support to law enforcement against economic and financial crimes which is implemented by the unodc
2945295 two others will be established one at the efcc office in ikoyi lagos and the other at the nigerian financial intelligence unit nfiu in abuja
2945296 the present constitutional arrangement does not sufficiently reflect the federal principle upon which the nigerian nation was originally founded
2945297 the retreat condemns all the obnoxious laws especially those that negate even the rudimentary principles of federalism which were enacted apparently with the purpose of denying the rights of the people to own and exercise control over resources located within their territories contrary to the principle of true federalism
2945298 the retreat notes that the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria as presently existing does not reflect the will and aspiration of nigerians and it is in many ways an impediment to peace and progress
2945299 the retreat reviewed the agitation for justice and equity in the niger delta and condemned the corruption of genuine agitation by criminal elements that minimise the aspiration of the people through kidnapping hostage taking and armed robberies as these are acts that are destroying the economy of the region
2945300 the retreat supports the long term and permanent restoration of justice through the legislative process
2945301 it was also the resolution of the retreat that the present derivation formula is obsolete and unrealistic
2945302 the retreat further enjoined the various houses of assembly within the zone to proceed to pass resolutions backing the decision reached at the retreat
2945303 to recognise the fact that there is really no military option available and that it is counter productive to demonise all militants as seems to be the case presently
2945304 based on the various existing reports studies and plans that have been produced over the past 50 years the nation should now have a
2945305 finally that time is running out and further delays in the purposeful resolution of the crises as presently exist in the niger delta region will certainly not augur well for the nation
2945306 short term problems in the niger delta could be addressed and ameliorated by a return to 50 per cent derivation
2945307 the coming of the present regime aroused eager hopes for a new beginning but much of the hope is now turning to anxiety the nation has everything it takes to move forward but the creative leap forward would happen only if the leader is devoted totally and visibly to the common purpose

2945421 i do not know what you have done that is so heinous i do not want to know i want you out of this room and i want you out now find somewhere else to cower in fright
2945422 did no one ever teach you that any ordinary lady would slap a mans cheek under such scandalous circumstances not punch him in the nose
2945423 i did not know that what i had always thought was liking was really love i have been very foolish
2945424 i liked you so terribly much hartley after each meeting i lived for the next time and when i had to leave early with aunt aggy there was a dreadful emptiness in my life where you had been i thought you my best friend in the world and i thought i would never know such friendship again town and the season were flat because i did not have my friend to share them with and then when i saw you again i was so happy that i thought i would burst i wanted you to kiss me and i wanted to say what i said to you afterward and i wanted to marry you because i liked you so much after we were married for those three days i i have never been so happy in my life and afterward i wanted to die i wanted the world to end because i thought you did not like me any longer
2945425 when i went through that horrid experience during my first season i called it love i thought that was what it was that horrible obsession the dreadful guilt the oh everything and all i have clung to since is the conviction that i wanted nothing more to do with love i saw jenny and gabriel together and other people too but i did not believe in it for myself so when i met you i think i was afraid to call my feelings what they were i thought everything would turn ugly i wanted to like you and you to like me so that we could be happy together
2945426 you have everything to offer me everything in the world in the whole universe your love a loyal and a warm and kind heart yourself you are so very worthy of being loved and all i can offer you is a soiled life
2945427 you worked for your living and i am glad you did or i would never have met you it is in the past those months at kits in the past where it will stay
2945428 there are perfectly respectable people in society who have a far more scarlet past than yours but even if you are right it does not matter its you i want priss only you we will live it through together whatever may be facing us and i know miles will receive you and the countess too she hugged me when i was leaving and even kissed my cheek i was never so surprised in my life
2945429 i know that you are say it priss i want to hear it i have dreamed of this moment for months and never believed that it would really come say it will you marry me
2945430 something i should have told you before you left alvesley something you ought to know whatever you decide to do with the knowledge once i have told you you have only to say the word lauren and i will walk back along this beach and up to the cliff top and into the village and i will never trouble you again never try to see you again it is a promise
2945431 i want it more than i have ever wanted anything else in my life for many reasons but only one of them really matters to me it is the one i did not tell you of because it seemed somehow dishonorable after you had carried out your side of the bargain so sweetly and so well i love you that is it you see the part i omitted just that i love you i do not believe it can really hurt you to know it lays no obligation on you i just needed to say it ill leave now if you wish
2945432 i can do this alone this living business all my life i have shaped myself into being what others expect me to be so that i will belong somewhere be accepted somewhere be loved by someone when i knew i could not belong to neville i felt as if i had been cut adrift in the universe i anchored myself by retreating into an even more rigid gentility i dont need to do any of that any longer and i do have you to thank but i dont need you any longer kit i am strong enough on my own
2945433 to love or to withhold love love and dependence need no longer be the same thing to me i am free to love that is why i love you and it is the way i love you if you have come here kit because you think you owe me something because you believe i might crumble without your protection then go away again with my blessing and find happiness with someone else
2945434 is that i will see your hair down now at last take out the pins
2945435 i am on unfamiliar ground here you will have to lead the way
2945436 jocelyn is a name that has been in my family for generations

2945438 i have always been fortunate enough to be able to enjoy happiness when it presented itself i have always had hope and i have always had the ability to see and appreciate the little things that can make life worth living but i know now that it has been years and years since i have felt totally happy i am happy now at this moment totally wonderfully happy no matter what the future has in store for us i want to remember that there has been this moment and that even this moment with no more preceding and no more to come after would make the whole mystery of living worthwhile

2945486 the last two weeks he has gone to another level its yet to be seen longterm but certainly hes just purely from volume of possession thats not the be all and end all but he hasnt experienced that consistently and been able to do it the last two weeks

2945493 olio amp farina sells a lifestyle a way of living we like to think we are successful because of the very special philosophy of quality and taste that we apply to the shops
2945494 the food and drink has to come from a small producer who uses traditional models we dont want preservatives it all has to be very natural and 100 per cent italian its definitely not like other italian based shops abroad were very strict youd never find garlic bread in our shops the mediterranean diet is the best in the world and we are really proud of it the olio amp farina format is really easy to replicate and we would like to extend it even further
2945495 we had always loved italian food and wine so when we came across olio amp farina we were just drawn to it the food we sell in olio amp farina is free from artificial flavourings everything in the food is on the label people are travelling more and becoming more concerned about eating healthily italian food is good for you its fresh and simple and most of all it tastes wonderful

2945542 i congratulate you and your team on putting together such a marvelously thought through project i am currently going through the tutorials and will make use of the facilities when ready
2945543 my colleague and i have just used our fourth a final 30 minute session on the faulkes north and south robotic telescopes we began in october 2005 due to all their problems and despite making 22 bookings most of which had to be recredited due to telescope faults in particular the poor quality new ccd cameras it has taken us almost three years to use up these four sessions out of the 22 sessions only 7 did not take place due to the weather to begin with in july 2005 the facility was excellent but once the ccd cameras were changed it was all down hill even now things are not so good as they once were there has been management changes but it has not help much i think schools in the uk have just about given them up
2945544 my impression so far with gras is very encouraging and i look forward to a an exciting relationship which i hope will develop over the years thank you
2945545 please feel free to use this email on your site as you see fit
2945546 here is my comment i dont have any problem if you need to use my name please correct any orthographic and or grammatical fault
2945547 thanks to let us enjoy of this unique opportunity to use professional astrophotography equipment i am a beginner in this world and i know how difficult it is to get pictures from the night sky with gras i have been able to get high quality pictures with only a pair of mouse clicks
2945548 i live in albuquerque nm about 100 miles from incredible dark skies and have been doing ap since 1996 as a hobby but this means moving many hundreds of pounds of equipment to those skies and hoping the weather is still good when i get there spending many hours packing the truck and trailer and spending 150 on gas and more on camping supplies renders this to a 3 or 4 day trip with loss from work so to be able to use world class equipment under world class skies while sitting at my desk in my robe on sunday morning is just mind boggling thank you
2945549 made me go out and buy my own telescope i will be learning the ropes of astrophotography and having fun with my small refractor and dslr setup
2945550 and then after that come back to use the gras telescopes hopefully with more skills
2945551 i enjoyed using gras as im traveling quite a bit and have no way to image and its become an addiction
2945552 at first there were some difficulties with using gras but the customer response was first rate and i was given extra minutes in compensation after that i took some nice pictures which i was able to manipulate in maxim and photoshop

2945623 i was sick and tired of coming home and feeling sick and tired
2945624 i knew i had to do something about it but i didnt know how to support my family financially while spending more time on my music and less time at work
2945625 i decided that i was going to start off small and work my way towards my goal of being my own boss
2945626 i joined the heavy metal band because there was nothing else in my neighborhood at the time if i had the option then i would have chosen hip hop if you listen to my hip hop beats you will notice they have a rock and roll edge to them i think that makes them unique
2945627 it took me weeks to figure out how to upload tracks on the various sites i was lost
2945628 i am very grateful to have a supportive family because i worked for most of the day which was very unfair to my wife i guess she understood that i was trying to do something that would benefit our family in the long run shes awesome
2945629 i started to make money and that made me want to work harder
2945630 i did not know anything about computers or internet marketing but i was selling something on the internet
2945631 i received an email from carlos and he expressed that he liked my beats and he wanted to propose a business venture to me the business venture included my own website a large marketing budget company branding and his know how i was skeptical at first but i decided to take a chance the rest is history
2945632 mark was very talented but i knew that i could help him with his marketing the first thing i noticed was the fact that he did not have his own website the beat marketplaces are a good way to make a couple sales here and there but there lots of noise on those pages that take the potential customers attention away from his product the first thing we did was build mark a site and promote his company brand bos beats
2945633 in order to make loyal customers we have given our customers many advantages when they think of purchasing a beat they come to us because we give them more for their money in this day and age of high gas prices and inflation thats all everyone is looking for more for their money thats what the site is built around
2945634 what can i say other than you cant beat bos beats the material is radio quality beats at affordable prices i feel like i have timberland type beats for a fraction of the cost i buy one beat and i get three mark has also given me feedback that has helped improve my skills as a rapper my sister sings and she also buys her beats from bos beats hes the truth man

2945725 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2945726 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2945727 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2945751 in fact we have proven that the online graduate program is as rigorous if not more so than any other campus program the quality of this program is reflected in our outstanding students that come to us with undergraduate degrees from top ranked universities such as princeton stanford georgia tech and more
2945752 i have had some periods with very long work hours that have been difficult to get in studying however i was able to do it and still take three or four courses during my last deployment to iraq the school and quality of the instructors make it worthwhile the students are also a cut above and committed to learning
2945753 if more retired military personnel worked in financial planning they could help the younger soldiers make better financial decisions for themselves they would trust them with their money because they trusted them with their lives
2945754 we had heard about captive from other credit union marketers that had either switched from another system to captive or installed the codigo application after reviewing several options
2945755 they reported a very positive experience and i have to echo those comments we have had a productive relationship with captive since installing the first unit in october of last year that experience prompted us to switch more of our branches to captive and we anticipate installing their system in new branch builds over the coming years
2945756 i absolutely recommend captive to other credit unions looking for a digital merchandising system this product is flexible progressive and easy to use
2945757 it is great to see a customer make use of several different display technologies to capitalize on the unique one to one marketing opportunity each area of the branch offers
2945758 we couldnt be happier with the relationship we have with coasthills fcu and look forward to working with them on more branches in the future
2945759 in our view its the richness of diversity like a colorful tapestry that makes the world and our neighborhood such a wonderful place
2945760 we wouldnt be able to go and watch them as the train station will not sell us any train tickets so i dont really care
2945761 the slogan is now about a safe olympics and of course in the chinese way of doing things they impose more restrictions
2945762 and even if they are just buddist monks religious forces are always regarded by the chinese government as one of the political threats to the regime
2945763 they always come to ask us where have you been and who have you talked to
2945764 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion

2945793 we are in a rut and cant get out of it ive met victims whove lost loved ones over 30 35 years and theyre still the same
2945794 i was brought up to believe democracy and justice was the road to go if somebody offended or hurt you where is the rule of justice
2945795 you have nobody been put in jail for the murder of 31 innocent people one of the 29 victims was pregnant with twins call it political murder but murder is murder no matter what way you look at it
2945796 it was premeditated murder they plotted and created a situation where innocent people were going to lose their lives
2945797 the system doesnt work for victims of terrorism nobody wants to catch these people and any in jail on the good friday agreement have been let out on the whim of getting terrorists into government
2945798 to me its just another day its hard to believe it is ten years on and where time went to so quickly
2945799 but the thoughts in my mind are still as fresh as the day it happened and the hurt still there and the love for my daughter who i lost
2945800 how did i learn about this the editor sent me a note asking me to please stop telling writers she was assigning ooof and the editor copied me on the pitch i will never ever forget this freelancers name and not in a good way
2945801 do you think theyd be interested in a piece about the high mortality rates of camel drivers in baghdad
2945802 he is seriously concerned about the disproportionate use of force by the russians and the lack of respect for the territorial integrity of georgia
2945803 i wasnt so happy about him going because he was only eight
2945804 i watched him until he went out of sight over the hill
2945805 four local boys and one of the spanish students five of them going down the road and that was it the last i saw him alive
2945806 i just knew they were there to tell me something about the trip i just knew
2945807 he was up at the leisure centre and said every now and again people were called to come up that there was a list of missing people and gradually it was getting smaller as people were getting found but there was still no word about oran and sean
2945808 mickey just said dont worry ill bring the wee man home ill find him
2945809 at 7am i saw people hugging each other at the mcloughlins house
2945810 someone came up and said wee seans dead at that exact minute the phone rang it was mickey he said have you heard the news i said yes wee seans dead and he said yes and orans dead too
2945811 we usually reserve a push for 1000m and another with 750m to go but we called it before each marker because we knew the pace was very hot
2945812 theres nothing wrong with us were still flying we just got beaten
2945813 in world cup competitions we do one possibly two races on a friday have a semi on saturday and a final on sunday so thats three to four races in three days
2945814 the world championships and olympics are different because everything is spread out its sort of a luxury having days in between so were well able for it
2945815 i hated it at first almost gave up in the first six months with the full time training especially the running i hate running
2945816 her positioning shot selection and decision making on court were very good
2945817 obviously she still needs a lot of technical work on her footwork particularly but if she gets these things right chloe has a very big future
2945818 she likes it when she is up against it when she is involved in decisive moments and you have to like being under pressure at this level
2945819 id say 3 000 was probably the biggest crowd i had ever played in front of so this would be good for me if i do go to london
2945820 i have loads to improve on and i will take away a lot from this is
2945821 the fitness is the main thing the court here was very slow so that means you can have lots of rallies without winning points
2945822 but i am young enough that if i wanted to id have two more olympics in me
2945823 my best result ever was my world cup win in spain before athens
2945824 but no one remembers that in an olympic year theres no point in performing in world cups if you dont do it here
2945825 ive drawn him so many times i knew god was going to be on my side this time
2945826 sixty four boxers in the worlds and i drew him in the first round
2945827 anywhere gerry shows up i always do good he missed the last eus but hes been here and hes been in the training camp and the village
2945828 i lack belief sometimes but once i believe in my potential i can do anything
2945829 if this guy beats you anymore hes going to bring you home and put you on the mantelpiece
2945830 i kind of knew i was up i could hear the crowd
2945831 you just have that feeling when youre winning and i could see it in his kates eyes that he was weak after the second round
2945832 because in the last couple of fights he had me gone in two rounds he was in control
2945833 he wanted to know the score but i wouldnt tell him
2945834 ive seen it before when hes behind hes not bad but when hes ahead he panics he runs and hides and i didnt want him doing that i wanted him to keep doing what he was doing
2945835 so i just told him not to worry about the score
2945836 i could have boxed better but theyre the tactics you need to beat him just round by round taking it slowly
2945837 usually as a tournament goes on the better i go
2945838 and thats why i was hoping to get a good draw but god didnt give me a good draw he gave me the toughest man i could have expected in the first round a man who has beaten me the last three times in just over a year
2945839 so beating him the way i beat him is some achievement in the worlds he scored 32 points against me he got just five today hes been my bogeyman hes been torturing me for the last year drawing him in the first round everywhere i go
2945840 i needed to come up with something special and i did happy days
2945841 and itll be hard to bring him down a little bit so again thats a bit of a problem hes up on a high now theres expectation with him and the jitters will come again people are expecting him to do it so youve got to try and control it again keep everything on an even keel
2945842 hes so quick hes going to give any boxer here a lot of problems
2945843 a trip that took you back a hundred years in time

2945845 sexual abuse is virtually a fact of life for incarcerated women in the us
2945846 being a woman prisoner in american prisons can be a terrifying experience
2945847 there are often male correctional officers watching women undressing and showering the women are often afraid to report such incidences not only do the guards frequently threaten to take away visitation rights to keep them quiet they also have complete access to each inmates file which includes any reports against the guards if a guard is reported and punished the punishment usually only consists of his transfer to another facility
2945848 i have with me karsten wade whos the community manager for the fedora project
2945849 linux pro editor in chief joe casad sat down with
2945850 the forecast for gdp will in all likelihood be revised lower perhaps even to show a recession in the second half of this year at the same time we expect an upward revision to the cpi inflation forecast for 2008 the peak will probably be in the region of 5 5 per cent the bank is unlikely to endorse market expectations of rate cuts over the next 12 months
2945851 no doubt that the mood has darkened in the last two or three months
2945852 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now that has not turned out to be the case
2945853 most analysts are now suggesting that the economy will at best only manage to stagnate in the coming few quarters and that the growth prospects through 2009 and into 2010 look no better than anaemic
2945854 years of unsustainable increase in public spending have left the public finances in poor shape to cushion these adverse shocks
2945855 there was no violence no tension big crowds and sunshine all day long
2945856 with the combination of a pageant as well as the parade it gave tourists a good opportunity to see the reinactment of a historical event
2945857 it was very very peaceful with fewer people wanting confrontation the celebrations have become more and more part of the scene now and quite a large number of tourists were about on saturday taking photos
2945858 there were around 20 000 people there all in all this year was definitely one of the most successful ever
2945859 i feel i should have pulled my weight a bit more
2945860 the omagh community spirit i read so much about in newspaper articles never existed for me
2945861 the victims are running our own service which we did do the last five years
2945862 im not attending the other service weve held our service this last five years on the sunday closest to the date and thats the way weve been doing it everybodys welcome to come along and we want to progress that way
2945863 what ill be doing on the sunday is commemorating those murdered on the street
2945864 whats happening is just a big facade about the great job they the council think theyve done
2945865 as a council we have tried to do our best to mark the anniversary the wording issue as far as we are concerned is resolved the support group wanted certain wording at the garden and that has been included
2945866 if i dont feel right for it maybe ill let someone else have a go
2945867 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travellers
2945868 severely damage competition on major transatlantic routes and leave consumers worse off
2945869 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
2945870 theres nothing to stop virgin or any other airline competing on routes if they believe there is not enough competition
2945871 if we submit this application and if its approved there will be nine airlines operating across the atlantic and virgin will be the only one without antitrust immunity
2945872 they have got to recognise that the whole competitive climate has changed instead of just making the same arguments they did eight years ago
2945873 in terms of foreign direct investment fdi this is quite significant and goes a long way to support the federal governments quest for increased foreign investment in the nigerian economy
2945874 another 1billion is being invested this year in network roll out including coverage expansion capacity enhancement and quality improvement the impact of which is already being felt in the rapidly improving quality of service of our network
2945875 we are not targeting any individual but in the course of our investigation if we see anybody that is culpable we will not hesitate to bring such a person to book it is obvious that there is a grave error of judgment or fraud somewhere we hope that the committee would be able to get to the root of the matter
2945876 you would have noticed in the last couple of days a series of teaser campaigns on more in the papers on tv and on the radio quite a number of people have been wondering and asking what mtn is up to again i am happy to announce to you today that the waiting is over as we unveil what more means to your delight
2945877 at mtn we pride ourselves in delivering innovative services that positively affect the rhythm of life of our numerous customers in ways no other brand can
2945878 just a few days ago nigerians witnessed the very successful launch of mtn xtrapro with the soul stirring inspirational talk by chris gardner the man whose life story inspired the movie the pursuit of happyness and were wowed no other brand could have touched nigerian young professionals the way mtn xtrapro did we just lit up ibadan yesterday with our fixed network that we chose to call hyconnect thereby linking ibadan people with excellent fixed line network and more access to broadband internet via fixed lines this means more opportunities more excitement and more progress for ibadan indigenes life and business in ibadan can never be the same again
2945879 offers more functional and effective products and services than any other network in nigeria
2945880 which were just commercially launched include mtn fastlink data card that offer more speed than any competing product we have video cam a camera that offer customers more security for the things that matter to them mothers can work better and in peace because they can now watch their children at home even while they are at work husbands can watch the goings on at home even while away at work in the office from the comfort of their phone busy executives can achieve more as they can navigate their ways around town more easily by avoiding traffic bottlenecks when they call into the traffic monitor video cam more benefits more value more productivity more progress these are the tangible ways mtn moves nigerians ahead
2945881 mtn is here to give even more to nigerians via our very exciting value proposition packages
2945882 for our xtraconnect customers we offer more exciting products and services to enable our teeming customers go inspire their communities via our share and sell that allows them to send credit to loved ones
2945883 to all the youths on the mtn network who are on mtn xtracool it is a fact that we offer more free hours with our free midnight calls than any other operator
2945884 our high value customers on mtn xtraspecial are not left out of the load of more benefits
2945885 the bridge and our proposed development will open a new chapter in the tourism commercial recreational and residential potential of warrenpoint and the wider region
2945886 warrenpoint is the second port in northern ireland and the fifth on the island of ireland and it is expanding we want to ensure that the potential for development of the port is not restricted so that land would be available for us to expand
2945887 its not an ideal spot for the development of residential units we are very squeezed land wise and wed like to think that in the future that that land will be available to the port
2945888 this area is zoned for industrial use and we are very adamant that it should stay that way over 200 people work there and its responsible for 1 000 jobs in the locality so we would be very concerned about a residential development
2945889 its well known that if you mix residential development near ports this can only create disturbance for residents and restrictions for ports whereas in warrenpoint there is perfect segregation between the residential industrial retail and leisure areas so that every area has its own boundary and there is no conflict
2945890 we believe that this land should be retained for industrial use and may in the future be critical to the continued growth of warrenpoint enterprise centre and the port of warrenpoint
2945891 warrenpoint enterprise centre which is managed by newry and mourne enterprise agency occupies a site adjoining warrenpoint harbour estate with which we have a good working relationship
2945892 warrenpoint enterprise centre makes an important contribution to the local economy and indeed warrenpoint harbour is a facility of major strategic significance in the context of the northern ireland economy as a whole a move to change the zoning on this site could have a retrograde effect on warrenpoint enterprise centre and the future of the port of warrenpoint
2945893 best temporary measure to extricate the country from its worst situation
2945894 treasured memory we did our best against the greatest players in the world and i think it is a great step forward for the game in our country every young chinese person now knows how the game is played at its best
2945895 mom i just want to be some kind of star in this world
2945896 i expect to be electrified its probably going to be the most watched basketball game in the history of the world its going to send a lot of chills through my body just being out there
2945897 im proud of this young team they have come to represent their country with pride and they showed respect to the chinese players tonight it was recognised that our opponents have made great strides and in a man like yao ming they have somebody to inspire a whole generation
2945898 its amazing being here with kobe he gives me an idea of what it must have been like travelling with the beatles hes been mobbed wherever weve gone
2945899 i knew i was going to enjoy this game but i didnt know how much
2945900 when our basketball players come to the olympics everyone is eager to identify them as the richest and the ugliest americans but there was no way that they would get the gold medal for that here after our cyclists wore their black masks
2945901 my mum and dad were always encouraging my brother and i to do sport and theyve been very supportive throughout my career
2945902 one of the benefits of riding all the disciplines when i was younger was that you rode across every sort of terrain through the year
2945903 in the past ive tried the other route racing all season and id got to the major championships without a full tank
2945904 it was a high risk strategy and this was the first time i had tried it but i stuck to it and believed in it
2945905 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me a thumbs up and holding up the american flag
2945906 phelps has been using that as a weapon for a while
2945907 logic should say he shouldnt go down deep but he beats people off that last wall there is nothing scientific yet to explain why it is effective to take that trajectory
2945908 we have not ruled out every known species but we have looked at those species known to live in that area
2945909 there are so many reports of yeti like beasts across south and central asia that i would not be surprised if there are still some pockets of these very very rare and shy creatures
2945910 we would welcome more tourists but we dont want to lie to them in the name of the mande burung
2945911 i believe 100 per cent there is something i will not say it is mande burung because we have not found it but as long as there is no proof we will keep looking
2945912 there are many stories in our myths about elves or whatever but the mande burung is not part of that folklore
2945913 the creature was on the rock he was playing with a stone hitting it against the rock it was black
2945914 it was just a few seconds that i saw it i was very scared
2945915 we are not going to give up until we find it
2945916 would you like to buy your travel money will you come to the bank
2945917 frowned at the enormous powers of the cbn board and recommended that the cbn act be amended to reduce them

2945920 its more than i could dream for more than anything
2945921 before the race i felt like i was going to vomit then as i walked out i felt an amazing sense of calm
2945922 no matter what happens now i can walk away from the most successful olympics ive ever had
2945923 ive been blessed with the family and friends that i have now im getting the chance to enjoy a bit more time with them
2945924 thats probably the greatest change 10 or 20 years ago i was performing and training all the time now i get to spend time with my family and friends its a wonderful change
2945925 we had a wonderful time michael jnr enjoyed the day and my parents had a great time thats what life is all about for me now
2945926 he is a great man who did an awful lot for this country when you look at what this country was like when he took office and what it was like when he left i think that tells its own story bertie ahern was a great leader for ireland and world leaders say that not just me
2945927 there are times when i get the feeling that some people would be happier if nothing was ever built here and that all the old castles and great houses should be allowed fall down rather than be repaired
2945928 i still fervently believe in ireland this is the best country in the world but we have a lot of issues we need to look at not least about how we value our heritage and what we are prepared to do to save it
2945929 it was almost like a self perpetuating prophecy if you focus on doom and gloom long enough then its bound to come true
2945930 its a bio plexis treatment that aims to harness positive energy to heal and benefit the body its absolutely remarkable
2945931 hij zegt dat hij aangetrokken wordt door paarden en dat hij de verleiding niet kon weerstaan toen hij het beest zag staan
2945932 we dachten dat we alles al gezien hadden maar dit slaat werkelijk alles
2945933 je kan in elk van onze meren zwemmen en als je de kraan opendraait kan je met plezier van ons water drinken
2945934 het is de taak van inter airlines om voor een oplossing te zorgen wanneer de luchtvaartmaatschappij de vlucht niet kan uitvoeren
2945935 we zullen hoe dan ook de schade berokkend aan onze klanten op inter airlines verhalen
2945936 the connections have decided to give the nunthorpe a miss and leave him for a possible run in the sprint cup at haydock
2945937 we are aiming for a foreign campaign in the later half of the year so if we decide he needs a bit longer he might give haydock a miss too
2945938 the horse is absolutely fine but hes been on the go since wolverhampton in march and weve had such a good run so we decided to give him a holiday after the july cup
2945939 we are looking at the global sprint challenge races and thinking about running in melbourne at the spring carnival meeting

2945948 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

2945957 i dont think theres anything preventing the game complexity of bioshock from being on the wii
2945958 doesnt think theres anything preventing the game complexity of bioshock from being on the wii
2945959 i think there is an appetite out there its just a matter of finding the right way to bring it to them
2945960 it seems like on the wii theres some education necessary for a large part of that demographic in terms of heres why you should want to play this game instead of wii fit
2945961 with something like the wii you just pick it up and its natural
2945962 i dont think theres anything preventing the game complexity of bioshock from being on the wii
2945963 what i dont know is why people pirate my games
2945964 i might be able to get a general idea as to why people pirate stuff in general from reading warez forums and every other story on digg but im not interested in the general case i want to improve my business and ensure i stay afloat and to do that it would be mad to sit in the corner and ignore the opinions of that section of the public who pirate my games
2945965 i wont publicise who e mailed me or even store the addresses share them tell anyone them or make any use of them whatsoever ill just read them nothing else it will be entirely off the record and effectively anonymous i wont hand any email addresses to the riaa mpaa bsa or anyone at all under any circumstances ever
2945966 i occasionally post about piracy on my blog and i get a lot of comments from people who defend piracy or think i am too strongly against it or that i blow it out of proportion
2945967 the last few times i read these comments i got to thinking about the other side of the fence and wondering if there was something i just didnt get pirates never talk to the developers so i thought id see if there was something i could learn from it if i asked them for their honest views
2945968 i think its crazy for people to resent such a small price for a game i dont feel like the world has ended though we all routinely spend more than 10 or 15 on things that dont last as long as a decent pc game
2945969 a 15 t shirt can be a spur of the moment buy but a game for the same cost needs to be a work of genius i dont get why that is
2945970 most of them have been generic piracy points which is interesting although not the original request
2945971 i have got a few sarcastic ones but a lot of very long well thought out explanations mainly from people who dont pirate games now but used to in the past
2945972 pirates deliver a more convenient product at a better price
2945973 the ones that bug me are the people who are just trying to save money but could afford it or the ones with some intellectual justification for believing its their human rights to get free stuff
2945974 the thing is i personally prefer single player games so thats the style of game i design i do think a lot about the best way to set up my game demos the website and what after sales support content and patches to provide in order to reduce the extent of piracy for my games
2945975 i honestly think i might learn something ip owners characterize all pirates as freeloading scum
2945976 pirates characterize all ip owners as fat cat billionaires in gold plated ferraris its about time we both listened to each other more
2945977 dont be afraid to talk about piracy a lot of big name developers have blamed piracy for disappointing sales and there is a perception that the minute you mention it everyone will kick you in the face because its happened a lot recently

2945997 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
2945998 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mindset

2946002 market traders have been very supportive of our efforts to manage a market in street and in some cases these traders have continued to set up stalls at the market despite them week after week making very little money
2946003 i think the concept of a market in street is a good idea but the issue for residents in nearby roads is that many of them step out of their front doors and straight on to pavements or roads and it can be dangerous if all the traffic is passing down their roads
2946004 we would expect this to foreshadow a slowdown in the monthly trend rate of growth in employment

2946061 piracy is the way to get established and get your name out theres no way to stop it so were using it to our advantage
2946062 its this really gritty tacky sleazy jungle music its just genius
2946063 its making it possible for every kid in brazil to know their songs by the time they turn five
2946064 its actually good for a lot of money you give it away and it will come back thats literally true with information not with property
2946065 this year the multinational record labels will only release about 40 records by brazilian artists while tecnobrega artists will release around 400
2946066 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
2946067 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists
2946068 before you couldnt get your record played on the radio if you couldnt afford payola now if a song hits big with the aparelhagens the radio has no choice but to play it

2946094 there is a change of tone warnings that have not been issued before

2946102 im sick of suffering i left suffering behind when i came out of the closet
2946103 non violent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue it seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored
2946104 dont you know you can die if you dont eat
2946105 we need peace to return so that the civilian population is protected
2946106 that is all from that point of view president saakashvili has accepted almost all the proposals we made to him
2946107 try to finalise all our efforts around a document that could be accepted by both sides
2946108 you talk about the americans of course they are in a sense part of the conflict that is why we must emphasise the presence and the strength of the european union
2946109 i do not think the americans will commit any further of course we have to get them to participate in the peace process
2946110 this peace process is being intitiated and it must be initiated by president sarkozy who holds the presidency of the european union
2946111 our task is clear we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides
2946112 we must talk about negotiations and a political solution there is no military solution
2946113 we are not yet at the stage to be carefully optimistic we are doing our best and we will see what comes out today tomorrow and at the eu ministers meetings on wednesday
2946114 you talk about the americans of course they are in a sense part of the conflict that is why we must emphasise the presence and the strength of the european union

2946124 beyond the press release creative strategies for increased media and consumer visibility
2946125 in the course of our research we were surprised by the amount of medical inaccuracies that these newspapers had published said dr racine some journalists even wrote about mrs schiavos reactions to specific words or expressions supposedly showing that she was conscious
2946126 our observations show that the press capitalized on the controversy to a large extent and selling copies mattered more than delivering scientific information media coverage sustained myths and false hopes
2946127 the public debate surrounding this case showed that the medical ethical and legal consensuses on the legitimacy of the withdrawal of treatment in accordance to a patients will were challenged
2946128 this case is quite original because it reveals the emergence of a pro life social stream a trend that has now reached canada
2946129 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2946130 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
2946131 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
2946132 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits
2946133 residents are not satisfied with the pace of the recovery effort but they do see it moving in the right direction
2946134 most americans have forgotten about the challenges facing new orleans
2946135 my wife and i will stay in england where democracy is more important
2946136 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
2946137 interfering in the justice process by the group of people who see me as their political enemy
2946138 i expected everything would be better that i might have a chance to prove my innocence and receive a fair trial when i returned to thailand
2946139 if i have a chance i will come back to die on thai ground
2946140 if you look at the quality of the squad weve got and when you sign the players that we signed in the off season you would expect to be short priced favourites
2946141 weve got to live with that but it will be interesting to see how we cope with the pressure
2946142 sydney wont have any worries about overseas players coming in and needing six months to settle in theyre local boys and they know whats required of them
2946143 pre season is pre season but in saying that weve started really well its given us a bit of confidence so certainly the signs are looking good
2946144 were quite happy to fly under the radar but ultimately no new zealand team has finished better than last and were out to change that and get in the top four
2946145 i think this is going to be the closest a league weve had so far
2946146 all eight teams would be crazy not to be aiming for the top four
2946147 if you get up there and hold the trophy at the end of the year than you know youll be a worthy winner
2946148 weve got the opportunity to get 12 next week against essendon and weve never beaten essendon in melbourne in the history of our club
2946149 hopefully its not one of those clubs where for some reason you just cant do it
2946150 thatll be a challenge for us but where we sit its important we keep the pressure on ourselves
2946151 the last two weeks he has gone to another level its yet to be seen longterm but certainly hes just purely from volume of possession thats not the be all and end all but he hasnt experienced that consistently and been able to do it the last two weeks
2946152 i think he will continue to grow as a midfielder hes in our senior leadership group hes a very important player for our football club and hopefully hell be here for 10 years
2946153 hes been asked to do tagging roles but now with rob shirley bryce campbell and richard douglas starting to take those roles over nathans gone into another phase of his development
2946154 we want to discourage this and warn that there is the potential to be fined or ejected from the ground in the interest of player security and the security of other patrons
2946155 back then you wouldnt have thought too much about safety but things have changed since then and you have to think about it differently
2946156 it only takes one fool to do the wrong thing
2946157 it would be a pretty bold man to predict him kicking nine goals this weekend
2946158 i would like to see him get to the 100 and i think it will definitely take the next three games for him to get there
2946159 the talks will resume today after that president mbeki will come back to south africa
2946160 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
2946161 fourteen hours of discussion means there is some kind of disagreement if it was an agreement it would have been in two hours
2946162 from june 30 we have no longer been able to ship a pc with an xp licence
2946163 however what we have been able to do with microsoft is ship pcs with a vista business licence but with xp pre loaded that is still the majority of business computers we are selling today
2946164 looking into a crystal ball i dont think businesses will see much value in upgrading to vista until late next year and even so microsoft will probably have come out with something else by then
2946165 dave balter founder ceo of bzzagent said word of mouth performs better than any other medium hes hoping this program will convert some nonbelievers
2946166 we know the medium has significant impact and one way to help hesitant marketers dive into the pool is to guarantee it
2946167 are we 100 sure we can outperform all other mediums by 20 no but were pretty confident we can do something special here its time to put our money where our mouth is
2946168 the military conflict in georgia is the key factor in pushing up oil prices this morning so much has happened so quickly since we first heard of russias attack last week
2946169 if he keeps doing what hes doing at the moment and improving at the rate he is a rep jumpers definitely not out of the question
2946170 hes always been confident in his ability but hes just come along so much with the more first grade games hes played
2946171 hes consistently been in there now the last couple of years and i think hes getting smarter with the way he plays his footy
2946172 theres no doubt were going to miss toddys football brain and what he added to the side but weve had to move on as a group and i think terrys shown that hes ready to step into that leadership role especially in the halves
2946173 it seems the more pressure hes been under the better hes got hes still only a young guy its pretty exciting
2946174 were pretty aware of our situation we have a couple of losses in the next few weeks and all our hard work comes undone
2946175 the win over penrith doesnt change the mentality we have here were still just trying to make the finals and whether were flying under the radar or not we know we have to keep having 17 blokes committed to playing footy each weekend

2946208 were doing the right stuff the right rehab for the shoulder
2946209 theyre digging massaging deep into the shoulder trying to loosen up some tissue and at the same time im trying to play and swing a bat and thats kind of counteracting what were doing
2946210 i mean i come in today and the reason its recommended i not be in the lineup is for something other than my shoulder
2946211 were trying to get my shoulder back but ive started over compensating with my neck with my back
2946212 so were going to give it a little time to cool down a bit then get in there and dig without me having to swing a bat hopefully thats going to help in the recovery
2946213 theyve been talking four to six weeks to start seeing a difference four to six months to hopefully get back to normal
2946214 i was feeling good felt id been taking some better swings so its disappointing in that regard
2946215 but i think this is the right way to go
2946216 i trained my ass off for the last 10 weeks and gave everything i could if you lose to someone whos better than you you cant complain im in the best condition ive ever been in and i lost to a better guy
2946217 i didnt have to hear his name as soon as you hear kazakhstan youre fighting one of the best in the world
2946218 i stopped working 10 weeks ago to train im in debt here just to buy presents for everyone back home thats a problem with the money system for our top athletes im in china and ive got to find a store that takes credit cards to buy a present to take home
2946219 sport in canada is treated like a hobby anywhere else its a profession i speak to kids in school and i say follow your dreams i wanted to be a fighter and make the olympics and i went out and got that with determination if id done the same and become a doctor or a lawyer i wouldnt have to borrow money for a cab who knows i could have been a doctor and lawyer both because ive been doing this for 16 years
2946220 they put in 3 million and this year qualified 9 10 11 fighters theyre doing really well in canadian boxing we say give us funding and we can produce the government is saying produce and then well give you funding its the egg and the chicken

2946223 by bringing the bills here chances are good that ted rogers et al havent assured an nfl franchise in toronto but rather have guaranteed that there wont be one here for the foreseeable future their miscalculation has been innocent and baffling in a star struck way usually associated with your average fan not a major mogul that or ted and boys have outsmarted themselves
2946224 if we can mirror the success weve had in rochester it would be a win win for everyone
2946225 this is another step in our regional approach heading to the toronto marketplace and bringing meaningful product meaning games was always our long term vision our focus is simple whats the best way to strengthen the organization for the long term in western new york
2946226 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2946227 you have to get focused and give it a go
2946228 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2946229 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2946230 the last time i had five dunks in one game i was like 17 that was because of the energy of this crowd
2946231 i think they knew that history was being made tonight
2946232 we had open looks looks that individually were not used to getting but well do a better job
2946233 it was definitely an exciting game to play in just with all the media attention just kicking it off for ourselves i think this will really propel us into the rest of our competition
2946234 i think its realistic to talk about quarter finals as a first stage
2946235 i think theyre good enough to go to quarter finals i think we knew that
2946236 but then whats really important is to make the players perform at their best level individually so they leave everything out there on the field and not let the nerves or intensity destroy that focus that has been my focus
2946237 swedens definitely one of the top teams in the world i think theyre ranked third right now
2946238 theyre unlucky not to have beaten china two days ago
2946239 they keep the ball like china does but theyre a lot more physical its going to be a tough game but if we play the way we played saturday against china itll be a good game and we should create a lot of chances again

2946254 that was painful she certainly is beautiful in that event all the judges said she was so unique really classy im very proud of her
2946255 its a bit disappointing but at the same time i mean its the olympic games i did a pretty good job
2946256 obviously there were things that i need to fix but im still pleased with my performance

2946285 i need to convey that on wednesday march 7 2007 early before dawn i left home full of responsibility for the job that i cherish as a pilot he said
2946286 there was not even the tiniest intention in me at that time to deliberately execute my job carelessly and irresponsibly
2946287 i would be happy if i could help all passengers reach their destinations safely this is what ive been doing successfully in my 22 year career as a pilot
2946288 despite my intentions there was the accident which caused victims
2946289 heavy burden for him and his family who had already suffered the freezing of his flying licence his unemployment and harsh community opinion
2946290 i feel proud of my profession as a pilot and this job is the only source of income for my family marwoto said
2946291 my family and i feel very sad and struck that this incident has been considered a crime and i have been charged
2946292 im sad that all my efforts to save this flight mission has become grounds for charges which say that i was deliberately negligent
2946293 terrorists responsible for the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks when commercial jets were flown into new yorks world trade centre
2946294 after we carefully read the prosecutors indictment in this case the blurring of the indictment material especially in the formulation of the charges is obvious he told the court
2946295 not the authority of the criminal court to resolve the case and it should be handled by a special aviation court
2946296 the indictment made by the prosecutor is inaccurate unclear and incomplete and there is a mistake in the application fo the law assegaf said
2946297 we consider the indictment does not have any significant grounds as a starting point to be examined in this court so it is proper and feasible that the indictment be aborted or at least stated as being unacceptable
2946298 i have a surefire method to feel them out i go up behind a girl and whisper tickle your butt with a feather and when she turns around and asks what i said i say typical nasty weather if she smiles or laughs i know she has a sense of humor we chat and it all happens naturally try it

2946324 tivemos o controle do jogo em todos os momentos e n o deixamos que a r ssia nos intimidasse com sua for a e altura jogamos uma boa partida sem d vida
2946325 n o podemos nos precipitar n o ganhamos nada este foi s o segundo jogo e ainda tempos que enfrentar outras grandes equipes hoje foi tudo bem mas isso n o garantia de nada
2946326 continuo dizendo que n o estamos lutando por medalhas ainda
2946327 esse neg cio de cantar vit ria antes n o d certo naquele 24 a 19 parecia imposs vel perder mas acontece ganhamos dois jogos mas temos que manter a cabe a no lugar at o final
2946328 acho que elas entendem bem e sabem que a gente precisa continuar dessa maneira n o podemos mudar nosso comportamento e toda a din mica do que a gente treinou at o momento

2946336 a gente tem de torcer ainda mais do que muita gente porque no nosso caso para saber se gastamos com um ingresso para ver brasileiro ou se gastamos para ver um monte de caras que nunca vimos na vida
2946337 a gente vai descansar uma semana e come ar a pensar na copa em setembro n o pode perder tempo

2946346 pendant que les jeux olympiques battent leur plein et que la chine essaie
2946347 and for me a huge part of it is essentially spreading the word
2946348 thats when i decided i wanted to do business because its all around you
2946349 business has a tremendous power to influence lives both positively and negatively
2946350 if youre looking at a problem using one perspective youre going to only see one solution
2946351 whereas if you look at it from multiple perspectives youre going to see opportunities you never expected
2946352 when i was in business school from 1995 to 1997 people didnt understand they didnt grasp it
2946353 theres a huge interest at college campuses with global warming and these massive environmental issues
2946354 i do think your leadership is formed by your experiences
2946355 i think i have a very good understanding of what goes on at all levels of our organization
2946356 over time your experience just builds an intuition for how the business is done
2946357 its very easy to say weve always done it this way
2946358 is the leader is only as strong as the weakest member of his team
2946359 one of the things happening in the economy nationwide is the retirement stuff that used to tie people to particular jobs has been reduced
2946360 you have 401 k s that you can rollover but they are independent of an actual job
2946361 the company started to expand and as it expanded there just was more and more opportunity for me
2946362 strik ing a balance and augmenting the talent that we have locally with talent we bring in from outside our community or outside the state creates a strong team
2946363 just a registered nurse from caribou maine who was provided the fortunate opportunity to become their hospitals ceo
2946364 husson remains very interested in a law school in response to serious interest expressed by place bound northern mainers
2946365 if you had a larger number of attorneys in smaller communities it would be beneficial as far as making court appointments
2946366 i dont know whether the issue is another law school because people can go to law school anywhere and decide where theyre going to practice
2946367 the benefits associated with having a law school serving central and northern maine have not been challenged in this proceeding
2946368 weve estimated that in four of maines rural counties waldo hancock washington and aroostook less than 20 of practicing attorneys are under the age of 50
2946369 there are too many law schools producing too many lawyers but they dont move north
2946370 to the extent that a campus in northern maine or a different law school creates more lawyers who will do indigent defense that is probably not a bad thing
2946371 i know that a second law school would supply more attorneys
2946372 i think maine should focus on putting university of maine in the top 100
2946373 i cant see too many lawyers being in the area and being able to support a practice because its a poor area in fact when i opened my practice in 2005 people were nervous that another lawyer was moving in because they didnt think there was enough business
2946374 we are the law school of the entire state and we do try very very hard to draw students from around the state and to see that a lot our students remain in maine
2946375 in 10 to 15 years we might have an acute shortage
2946376 not have the financial resources to pay compared to corporate clients
2946377 in our practice we make money but we also have to answer a lot of questions for people on a daily basis that we dont get paid for
2946378 yesterday i got a call from someone who said there was someone trying to throw her out of her mobile home some other guy a bizarre situation youre dealing with a lot of everyday type problems that are caused by people living on the edge

2946467 the issue favre had was that he decided to retire very early after the season ended and then had second thoughts about it several times over

2946469 dont let yourself be rushed by outside influences otherwise it could lead to regret
2946470 these things dont come out of nowhere and many times things have built up inside

2946486 im sorry to say this as a life long fan and for the last few for me at least unforgettable months employee mcfc as we know it is finished here are the facts for those who really want to know thaksin is as of midlnight 10th august 2008 an international fugitive he now has to be found guilty of corruption in thailand in his absense offering no defence extradition requests will surely follow the pl will then have to find him short of the fit and proper ownership rules and believe me the pressure for that from fellow members has been growing since june thaksin is trying to palm off city onto whoever will now take it an insolvent mess of a business completely incapable of sustaining itself the truth is that the only interested party until recently wardle is not now able to bail city out now he cant come close on his own and no partners have been found the wage bioll and committments due on the last 2 years transfers have spiralled out of control the corluka affair is the last straw i personally worked on the deal and can assure anyone interested that he has already been transferred to spurs spurs have this evening started legal action and he will be barred from playing for city following an injunction in the courts tomorrow personally i expect hughes to then resign on principal he has no choice now he is on record as saying that he will have final say on all transfers many wont believe any of this but a few will i am very close to this situation readers will never know who i am or how close a few would know my name but it isnt appropriate to for me to come out trust me i am close enough to know what has happeneded in the last fortnight i am pissed off with it as a fan and as someone who has worked hard for the club durinig the ast 18 months or so and it must be said a little drunk i am posting this message on a few sites apologies for those that keep reading it but i want city fans to know what is happening the sad truth is we are finished and that as a result the pl will be facing its biggest challenge since inception within 2 weeks of now

2946506 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error or shortcoming but who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself for a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat

2946508 we are already acting for an ex ici blackley employee who has contracted bladder cancer and who worked at the plant from 1955 to 1980 we are keen to speak to people who worked at the same location from the 1950s through to the 1980s in order to establish what chemicals were used where and how
2946509 we have had contact with a number of witnesses and have been made aware that a significant number of people who worked at the site have subsequently died of bladder cancer
2946510 we know that there is a history of people exposed to chemicals developing cancers and in addition we are concerned that there may still be contaminated areas around the site which was bought by harrow estates in 2004 we would urge anyone who worked at the ici plant in blackley between 1950 and 1980 to contact our industrial disease team on freephone 0800 0384 384 as soon as possible
2946511 according to private statements made to journalists by a french officer who wished to remain unnamed the orders not to stop the massacres were given by admiral lanxade and or by general christian quesnot
2946512 before leaving for rwanda i used to come up to lanxade to collect my notes then take my orders from the private staff of the president of the republic
2946513 the purpose of amaryllis was to evacuate the french and more generally the foreign residents of kigali in a period of extreme tension
2946514 no hint of massacres there was fighting in kigali between the rwanda army and the rpf
2946515 as in all these confrontations in these regions there were executions on both sides and the mission of the french army was most clearly you must evacuate foreign residents and then draw back that is what we did
2946516 permanent preoccupation of not showing the media french soldiers limiting access to mustering points only to foreigners on rwanda territory
2946517 permanent care of not showing the media french soldiers not intervening to have the massacres they were close witnesses of be stopped
2946518 to avenge the death of president habyarimana the members of the rwanda presidential guard carried out reprisal actions as early as the 7th in the morning in the town of kigali

2946524 it is absolutely necessary for the offices of the agenzia del territorio to acknowledge the market trend when it comes to determining new cadastral values assessing revised values further to restoration work or carrying out general area revisions whereas the values currently in use are the same that applied two or three years ago and were obviously deemed appropriate at the time when the market was growing
2946525 in other words we should avoid what often happened in the past when the tax offices continued to assess and determine cadastral values based on figures that were out of sync with a clearly declining market
2946526 that means open garden must be starting again soon too

2946528 a police vehicle from elandslaagte was travelling along the n11 when it was involved in a head on collision with a golf travelling in the opposite direction

2946532 this is an episode from the ramayana the holy wedding of rama and sita rama as we know was quite tall while sita was relatively short in weddings the bridegroom garlands the bride and the bride garlands the bridegroom that is the custom
2946533 rama being quite tall could easily garland sita who was short but sita could not garland rama as he was very tall and she could not tell him come on bend down so i can garland you rama would not bend his head before anybody so it was a very embarrassing situation
2946534 watching this lakshmana came from a distance and fell at the feet of his brother rama to take padanamaskar immediately rama bent down caught hold of lakshmanas shoulders in order to lift him sita grabbed the opportunity and immediately garlanded rama while he was bent over lifting his brother rama would not bend otherwise rama bent only to lift lakshmana so this was quite a convenient event therefore this is an episode showing that sita is very intelligent this incident relates to the holy wedding of rama and sita

2946553 there are only a small number of displaced citizens who are still waiting for safety measures to ensure their safe homecoming
2946554 these humanitarian organizations include icrc which sorrowfully exaggerated the number of displaced residents as a result of the fighting
2946555 insecurity and fierce fighting in the northern governorates of yemen have had a dramatic effect on the civilian population in recent months forcing more people to flee the area
2946556 the lack of clean water and medical care is particularly serious for the displaced the sick the wounded and isolated communities
2946557 except in saada city and its immediate vicinity it remains difficult or impossible for the icrc to operate in the conflict zones of northern yemen

2946562 we learned from yemen that we should stand together with all the stakeholders
2946563 the efforts exerted toward dialogue and achieving reconciliation between hamas and fatah according to the yemeni initiative a security patrol in al mukalla was subject to grenades
2946564 threw a hand grenade into a security patrol station guarding the sea bridge in the city
2946565 we are still conducting investigations therefore we cannot accuse any group of carrying out the attack as we have no proof
2946566 we can say however that those who stand behind this attack have experience in executing terrorist acts
2946567 has put in place a security plan to repel any terrorist acts
2946568 security apparatuses in the governorate should be provided with more personnel and new techniques in order to carry out the plan successfully
2946569 while the study of the regions pre history and pre modern history i e pre islamic early islamic and medieval islamic periods is often well served at european and u s universities study of the contemporary middle east is often underrepresented at these institutions
2946570 to offset this balance the colleges curriculum focuses on the study of the contemporary middle east with historical courses offered to students who feel the need for such background
2946571 we expect that this project will be a new bridge for cultures
2946572 he is in poor condition especially since he was detained and his family doesnt know where he is imprisoned and how to provide him with medicine
2946573 our concerns are increasing about luai particularly after many prisoners and detainees have died in prison according to local reports these include people such as hashim hajar who died in september 30 2007 inside the central jail when the court refused to send him to the hospital despite medical reports confirming his health condition was poor due to liver disease
2946574 the insistence of security apparatuses to detain luai although the war in saada has stopped and his health condition is serious
2946575 end the secret detention of luai and release him immediately as well as direct security apparatuses to abide by the law when detaining anyone suspected of being involved in illegal acts
2946576 his condition is worse in detention as security apparatuses have prevented him from accessing any medication
2946577 at about 11 a m a central security vehicle accompanied by men in plainclothes believed to be from the political security apparatus came to luais house and first detained his younger brother nizar
2946578 they kept nizar for a while and sent him home to tell luai that security men needed to ask him about someone they were looking for when luai arrived security men took him to an unknown place and came back to his house at night to take his laptop and medicine telling his brother that they need luai for a day or two
2946579 there is still some resentment about the way the establishment came into being in the first place
2946580 having said that it is there and obviously the hospital does help a certain number of patients that are classified as being of medium risk clearly there is a case for having security to hold people of that category
2946581 i think it is fair to say there is mixed feeling on the one hand people are concerned about having a large fence erected but from a security perspective that would benefit local people
2946582 another thing is that for most of the perimeter the fence has been set quite well back so around most of the hospital it should not be too unsightly
2946583 but at one area there is not enough room so the hospital has a programme of landscaping to lessen the impact
2946584 i think paul cowans and his staff have been very open and they have discussed the plans with us in a very open manner that is obviously useful in terms of trying to bring local residents on side
2946585 there are still some people who feel quite raw about the presence of the hospital
2946586 the other concern we all have is that once they get the fence in place whether there will be a change of strategy
2946587 to be fair to the hospital they have declared that thats not their intention and thats not the purpose of putting the fence in

2946589 son it really depends on how much conscientiousness one has you see people of true and sincere faith in god already have it made as to how to worship god and more importantly how to deal with the day to day chores of living god must be more than just someone we bow and pray to or write notes to god is more than some being we claim to call on us in our sleep and ask us to deliver mankind god is certainly not some deity who demands of us to blow half the world in his name as some of our misguided wahhabi so called jihadists contend all of these nincompoops are not doing god any favors by claiming to correspond with him each in his own way
2946590 but son dont you think the israelis have those nukes to face the arabs who are waiting for the first opportunity to annihilate the jewish state which was imposed upon this region by a misguided international community unable to tell right from wrong
2946591 mother you see all of these people are just messing around with religion to suit their own mundane aspirations the zionists have pulled a big number by claiming that god would truly sanction real estate to trespassers who do not have the least legitimate proof of ownership of the holy land which was ordained by god for all his truly god fearing believers of all faiths and which has been inhabited by the palestinians for millennia we all know god to be just and merciful and certainly would not allow for an injustice to be meted out in his name the neo christians are seeking some spiritual comfort for relief from an extremely non altruistic culture that has overtaken one of the most beautiful regions of the world ever since the white man first set foot on massachusetts bay there are different explanations of how the christians could come up with the idea of obliterating the jews but the zionists think their stockpile of nukes will avoid that so they believe that letting the neo christians think like that suits their purposes well for now they may actually be encouraging people like george bush and dick cheney to think that this is godsent christian belief then we have our lunatic wahhabi suicide legions that have been scientifically reared to disguise themselves as the angel of death and just blow up anything that moves believing this to be the pathway to paradise nothing is further than the truth these loonies are buying a one way ticket to eternal hell for having distorted islam beyond recognition and caused most of the havoc that is shaking the world today they even established an unusually powerful clergy which is anathema to islamic belief since allah forbids the emergence of a clergy as a medium between man and god yet thanks to the trillions of petrodollars they have access to they have managed to spread this heretical sect of islam to the far corners of the world expending around us 200 billion over the last three decades alone i am not sure which is more dangerous to the moslem nation or ummah but if you ask me i think that the last of the three is a fifth column we really have to keep our eyes open to they have seriously damaged the image and the position of islam as a leading sensible and down to earth simple faith

2946610 georgia does not stop its treacherous actions on abkhazias border and continues to intensify its military presence the armed forces of the republic were forced to enter the security zone and advance towards the georgian border
2946611 we decided to redeploy our troops to be able to resist the russian armed forces which outnumber our troops
2946612 this number has nothing to do with the real state of affairs we lost two aircraft su 25 and tu 22 and the situation has not changed since then

2946652 it was blown completely out of proportion i never overdosed
2946653 its something that people go through in their lives especially growing up in london and its not something ive ever had a problem with
2946654 i need to convey that on wednesday march 7 2007 early before dawn i left home full of responsibility for the job that i cherish as a pilot he said
2946655 there was not even the tiniest intention in me at that time to deliberately execute my job carelessly and irresponsibly
2946656 i would be happy if i could help all passengers reach their destinations safely this is what ive been doing successfully in my 22 year career as a pilot
2946657 despite my intentions there was the accident which caused victims
2946658 heavy burden for him and his family who had already suffered the freezing of his flying licence his unemployment and harsh community opinion
2946659 i feel proud of my profession as a pilot and this job is the only source of income for my family marwoto said
2946660 my family and i feel very sad and struck that this incident has been considered a crime and i have been charged
2946661 im sad that all my efforts to save this flight mission has become grounds for charges which say that i was deliberately negligent
2946662 terrorists responsible for the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks when commercial jets were flown into new yorks world trade centre
2946663 after we carefully read the prosecutors indictment in this case the blurring of the indictment material especially in the formulation of the charges is obvious he told the court
2946664 not the authority of the criminal court to resolve the case and it should be handled by a special aviation court
2946665 the indictment made by the prosecutor is inaccurate unclear and incomplete and there is a mistake in the application fo the law assegaf said
2946666 we consider the indictment does not have any significant grounds as a starting point to be examined in this court so it is proper and feasible that the indictment be aborted or at least stated as being unacceptable

2946671 imagination plays too important a role in the writing of history and what is imagination but the projection of the authors personality

2946675 when the local defence volunteers the fore runner of the home guard were formed in great britain their formation was not extended to northern ireland in response the inspector general of the royal ulster constabulary offered the northern ireland prime minister the services of the ulster special constabulary to fill the gap and fulfil the role under taken by the ldvs in great britain this resulted in the formation of the local defence volunteers section yes thank you again but its not particularly helpful as its not dated sign in before you can post messages join this group please update your nickname on the yourplace com gt wrote gt gt gt on the other hand and bringing it right back the only only part of the gt gt gt uk gt gt gt where no home guard or ldf was in northern ireland for fear on the part gt gt gt of gt gt gt the local government that arming catholics would not be a desirable gt gt gt outcome gt gt hmm the queens university student rag mag is called ptq one gt gt of the wartime covers showed a pair of armed and uniformed home gt gt guards marching smartly past a couple of scruffy specials with sticks gt gt and a bad case of weapons envy gt gt so i am fairly sure the home guard existed here too gt well eventually they were formally named that but it was largely a gt cosmetic exercise gt in britain the hg were a military organisation under the territorial army gt in northern ireland local defence consisted entirely of b specials a gt police force and in its original guise of the ulster defence volunteers was gt nothing more than a branch of that force to whit the local defence gt volunteers section gt this was then passed unchanged to the control of the ruc and when this gt section was actually renamed as the ulster home guard it was still manned gt by the same cadre of b specials and still a police force gt finally they did come under the direct command of the british army but they gt and their b special parent organisation were used interchangeably in the gt local defence role gt in short a very different organisation to the british home guard and with gt no affiliations with that organisation whatsoever just for the record they the b specials were seen by the british police as an affiliated

2946695 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
2946696 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
2946697 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
2946698 a detailed description and name for each species of bacteria are needed so that different laboratories can recognise all of the bacterial species present in the mouth
2946699 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around 7 p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
2946700 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
2946701 its too early to say what happened exactly were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation

2946703 married people are still healthier than unmarried people but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
2946704 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those socials groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
2946705 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided

2946733 we want to keep our jobs we want to retire out of here
2946734 we didnt trust them we are better served by local ownership than anybody from outside they made a commitment when they came here to keep both papers its better for our continued jobs
2946735 this guy tierney came in here clean he cant help it if boscovs closed he cant help the price of gas give him a chance dont kick a guy in the head by demanding more
2946736 they want to keep both papers in a struggling economy
2946737 people want their daily news people want their inquirer i hope we can stay alive until something happens to improve the conditions and we can live to fight another day
2946738 their support is very important to us john is one of the most widely respected union leaders in the city he wants to get away from the old way of thinking us against them that has been going on too long
2946739 johns whole thing is saving as many jobs as he can and have as much work as possible this goes a long way in securing that
2946740 john realizes that the local owners are committed to the newspapers one of the owners tierney is in the building the others are local and accessible he wants to see us succeed his 300 members want to keep working

2946744 she doesnt even care if they are married and she loves bragging about her conquests you name it millie has done it
2946745 she joked about being a porn star but i dont know if she really meant it
2946746 she is a poisonous seductress who shouldnt be allowed near our prime minister
2946747 the question is whether our fellow citizens will do more than just pour concrete there are big opportunities to be grasped
2946748 they only planned on a week there which is a bit unusual as they still have some time together before he continues military training
2946749 nearly all of us would like to have a canadian passport
2946750 being a young person full of dreams and ambitions that are very difficult to fulfill in yemen its understandable that people look to immigrate
2946751 i want to return to yemen strong with solid work experience financial stability and a back up plan
2946752 the real challenge is that once i fulfill all of my goals in canada will i have the courage to leave the good life behind and return to yemen only time will tell
2946753 i can understand why a lot of yemenis would rather stay here in canada
2946754 the truth is that when they return to yemen theyre never valued for their hard work and good positions usually are given to those with connections
2946755 besides there are new laws that make it much easier to become a resident so why go to all of that trouble
2946756 the real question when it comes to patriotism is how much a person contributes to the betterment of his or her country if he or she doesnt then does it even matter if one lives in their native country or not
2946757 at first im planning to go alone to a european country then once i receive citizenship my family will follow
2946758 first ill go on a tourist visa and once i arrive ill claim that i experience discrimination in my country and ill appeal for humanitarian refugee status
2946759 so far i havent decided exactly what ill tell them but i could say that i was born a shia and that when i changed my religious affiliation to sunni i experienced problems in my community
2946760 or i could say that im under threat from revenge killing which is widespread in yemen and that the involved authorities cant protect me and my family
2946761 even if i dont obtain refugee status or citizenship ill be fine
2946762 these european countries are famous for respecting human rights so they wont breach my rights as long as i live there
2946763 im not worried about that too much because such countries have something called social insurance and medical insurance if i become a citizen i can enjoy this insurance even if im not working
2946764 ive agreed with djibouti lady there to marry then ill automatically receive citizenship
2946765 i know we must prove that were married since the immigration authority will investigate us according to information ive received from my friends there this authority will put us under intense observation and question us on very personal and private matters to ensure that were married
2946766 for this reason ive decided to rent a room in her house if shell allow it and then together we can prepare ourselves for any type of questions
2946767 it would be a problem in yemen but there its not i can make more money there as a grocer than as a business manager in yemen
2946768 i know someone from hadramout who said he was from darfur and requested refugee status he simply burned his documents and educated himself on sudans political economic and geographic characteristics in order to be ready when the immigration authority questioned him and he did obtain refugee status
2946769 i met some yemeni men who prevented their wives from mixing with non yemeni women some even prevent their wives from leaving the house
2946770 we have one or two options were looking at and its possible well sign someone this week
2946771 the strikers position is something thats been pressing since the end of last season but now there is some light at the end of the tunnel
2946772 there is nothing at all to say about berbatov were looking at options elsewhere wed like to add to our squad and were making moves in that direction were trying
2946773 you could compare it asian music to what happened to reggae through the seventies
2946774 it was a music that expressed the voice of a small community its now a british form of music it has earned its place in the history of music
2946775 i cant think of a better place to be the asian scene in the uk means so much to me to be at i think the biggest mela in the world is really important
2946776 weve all had the experience of wanting to ask a question and regretting not doing so when the moment has passed
2946777 when it comes to topics such as history people can often be embarrassed to voice their queries but the only way to learn is to ask
2946778 learning about history should be fun as well as educational it is important that children and parents ask us their questions about the properties you might find out something amazing
2946779 why did they build so many ruined castles and abbeys in england
2946780 can you tell me where i can see the hobbits
2946781 does my ferret need to be on a lead in this area
2946782 did lady rachel ever de bone her fish before eating it
2946783 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2946784 theres no doubt that the stability and calm has created a good atmosphere that has allowed us to make more summer camps and oversee the youths
2946785 that has nothing to do with the camps the hatred of israel comes from israels occupation which burdens our hearts
2946786 theres no doubt that the stability and calm has created a good atmosphere that has allowed us to make more summer camps and oversee the youths
2946787 at approximately 19 00 on monday 28 july 2008 my husband samih eleiwi was detained from our house in khellet el eman quarter in the city of nablus i asked the civilian clothed armed men who came to arrest my husband about the security service they belong to and they simply replied the joint force they took my husband without showing me or my husband an arrest warrant i was worried about my husband since he suffered from several ailments that include a hernia in the stomach a platinum rod in the leg as a result of a traffic accident a few years ago depression and mental illnesses he suffered two heart attacks in the past and only drinks distilled water and drinks milk continuously the following day i went to jneid prison because i assumed that he was taken there i informed the guards that i came to visit my husband and i told them about his condition they informed me that they do not have orders regarding his visits and i went back home i contacted several officials from fatah and security services and informed them about my husbands condition i asked them to help me visit my husband but nothing has happened thus far several days later a woman whose son is detained in jneid prison informed me that her son told her that my husbands health condition is bad and that he is on a hunger strike to obtain his release as a result i am more worried now and i fear for his life
2946788 i think many of our problems as a country would be solved if people had thick passports
2946789 theres just no substitute for actually going and seeing things
2946790 you start to feel a level of responsibility to direct attention to things that actually matter more than to silly things like who youre dating
2946791 for a lot of actors our biggest fear is that were going to start talking about things we dont fully understand and sound like idiots
2946792 in the long run ill do much more good if when i open my mouth i have something worth saying
2946793 i realized that because of president bushs malaria initiative this baby had survived
2946794 when you go to a country and see your fellow americans feeding people or getting clean water or saving their lives you are really seeing the best of us we are exporting the best of who we are and who we should be
2946795 essentially pollution reaches peoples lungs even if they stay inside on high pollution days
2946796 there is no escape from wood smoke pollution particularly in older wooden houses during winter temperature inversions in christchurch or anywhere else
2946797 although the health impact isnt great there were small decreases in lung function during very high pollution days for boys with asthma
2946798 this is the first time that this urine test has been used to detect exposure to wood smoke pollution in new zealand
2946799 he doesnt seem to be a doctor as they meet patients inside the hospital and he doesnt dress like a doctor he looks more like a heavy metal fan
2946800 elisabeth has never had a normal relationship so she finds it very hard to trust anyone at all especially men the people who should have loved her most either abused her or let her down if anyone deserves some happiness its her
2946801 fewer than the number of staff employed by a typical medium sized city council in europe
2946802 the commission desperately tries to play down just how many people are now working for the eu they are extremely secretive about the number of people who are working to churn out regulations
2946803 these people are not elected and cannot be held accountable by ordinary citizens but they have a huge effect on our lives affecting everything from the price of electricity and food to the way we run the nhs
2946804 it is a complicated and opaque institution which leaves it wide open to influence from lobbyists and vested interests
2946805 if we try to impose our songs on them they will not accept it and our songs will receive no attention
2946806 students are no longer confined to their school curriculum to get culture since audio visual means appeal to youth more than reading
2946807 therefore we try to call them to the good b nasheed used to be thought of as gloomy but now young people are using the traditional islamic song form to help them in their daily lives
2946808 i use my voice to call people to allah through reciting the holy quran and preaching in the mosque
2946809 and i also use my voice to call people to allah and pay their attention to their behavior through nasheed
2946810 nasheed also focuses on the songs that urge people to hold out on the enemy during fighting
2946811 i realized that this side is marginalized since many islamic songs are overwhelmed by sadness and lamentation
2946812 because young people are full of hope and vitality we have to make songs that go along with their dreams and aspirations
2946813 a lot of religious scholars concentrate on issues of death for the sake of allah and neglect life for the sake of allah
2946814 we should include love issues in nasheed since the young are interested in such songs
2946815 a girl told me that her fianc refused to listen to nasheed because he thought it only dealt with revolution and jihad and didnt address love
2946816 religion is not confined to performing prayer and other kinds of worship
2946817 there are other issues that youth should learn in islam and religious scholars should display a clear image of islam
2946818 get google ads free review is get google ads free scam

2946826 hes in a fight not just against this disease but also against the discrimination he faces from society
2946827 my daughter had to leave her school because she suffered unbearable discrimination other children avoided her because they were scared she might have the virus like her uncle
2946828 even though my colleagues were nice to me i chose to leave the hospital however patients usually were scared when they learned that i was hiv positive requesting that i not come near them

2946837 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2946838 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2946839 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2946840 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2946841 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2946842 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2946843 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family

2946849 sexual abuse is virtually a fact of life for incarcerated women in the us
2946850 being a woman prisoner in american prisons can be a terrifying experience

2946995 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
2946996 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing

2947033 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read

2947111 hemos pasado de la desesperaci n a estar hasta el gorro
2947112 resulta un contrasentido que el ayuntamiento apruebe una medida y luego se desentienda de ella cuando llega a la comunidad de madrid
2947113 pero en la capital no pueden acogerse a esta medida
2947114 la ineficiente depuraci n de las aguas fecales e industriales de la capital y del cintur n metropolitano hacen que estemos ante un doble problema ambiental y sanitario este hecho conocido desde hace a os es consentido por las distintas administraciones locales regional y nacional
2947115 un azud que recoge las aguas cargadas de contaminantes de ambos r os y las deriva al canal del jarama
2947116 este canal tiene la misi n de servir agua para riego a todos los campos de cultivo de la rica vega del jarama y de la cual procede un n mero significativo de los productos hort colas que se consumen en la regi n
2947117 todo esto sucede en un escenario especialmente protegido el parque regional del sureste que a su vez es una zepa zona de especial protecci n de aves y un lic lugar de inter s comunitario un territorio que forma parte de la red natura 2000
2947118 al derivarse desde madrid los excesos de aguas urbanas junto con las industriales el porcentaje de metales pesados sobrepasa los l mites exigidos por la legislaci n y los tolerables por el organismo
2947119 la concentraci n de estos residuos es muy alta especialmente en los sedimentos del cauce
2947120 para solucionar esta grave situaci n sanitaria son necesarias medidas urgentes en toda la red de alcantarillado y depuraci n as como erradicar todas las captaciones abusivas que sufren los r os en sus tramos superiores bombeo del canal de isabel ii riegos

2947138 the democrats are gonna have to have a little caucus and decide how much further they want to carry harry reid
2947139 every six weeks or so theres another episode where he has to apologize for the way in which he has bungled the democratic case
2947140 its apparently irrelevant to broder that reids views are shared by president bushs regular military adviser henry kissinger or senior u s military officials or the majority of the american people
2947141 i t looks as if broder completely butchered his facts in asserting that reid has had to apologize every six weeks i just checked with reids office and they told me in no uncertain terms that reid has not apologized for any of his remarks during his first four months or so as majority leader he certainly hasnt apologized for the war is lost comment

2947145 this war is a mistake it was started by lying and deceiving the american public the best way to rectify this mistake is to end it as quickly as possible and do what we can to make amends
2947146 they inundated the international negotiators including with what appeared to be a number of report this comment
2947147 nowhere does mr gore tell his audience that all of the phenomena that he describes fall within the natural range of environmental change on our planet
2947148 nor does he present any evidence that climate during the 20th century departed discernibly from its historical pattern of constant change
2947149 but there are a lot of inaccuracies in the statements we are seeing and we have to temper that with real data
2947150 our civilisation has never experienced any environmental shift remotely similar to this
2947151 20 times greater than the warming in the past century

2947153 solar activity very precisely matches the plot of temperature change over the last 100 years it correlates well with the anomalous post war temperature dip when global carbon dioxide levels were rising
2947154 there should be a moratorium on building any more coal fired power plants
2947155 if you build a new coal plant youre making a 60 year commitment thats how long these plants are generally in use
2947156 so we really need to avoid building a whole new generation of coal plants that use the old technology
2947157 until we have that clean coal power plant we should not be building them
2947158 there are fast growing rural areas of the country where coal is the only affordable option hansens recommendations would put these areas at risk theyre a recipe for disaster
2947159 may be a great scientist but when it comes to energy policy apparently he has a lot to learn
2947160 prevent any plant from going forward that uses old coal fired technology
2947161 industry leaders know they are operating in a climate of uncertainty and that is a very uncomfortable climate for them
2947162 they need a clear path charted in terms of the expectations for advanced coal technology and thats what sen kerry is working on

2947164 iraqs sectarian violence from sliding into an all out civil war
2947165 for months the white house rejected claims that the situation in iraq has deteriorated into civil war
2947166 for the most part news organizations like nbc hesitated to characterize it as such after careful consideration nbc news has decided the change in terminology is warranted and what is going on in iraq can now be characterized as civil war
2947167 we should mention we didnt just wake up on a monday morning and say lets call this a civil war this took careful deliberation we consulted with a lot of people
2947168 the white house objects to the terminology that nbc news is now using and here is part of the statement that theyve released while the situation on the ground is very serious neither prime minister maliki nor we believe that iraq is in a civil war
2947169 well firstly let me say perhaps its easier to deny that this is a civil war when essentially you live in the most heavily fortified place in the country within the green zone which is true of both the prime minister the national security adviser for iraq and of course the top u s military commanders however for the people living on the streets for iraqis in their homes if this is not civil war or a form of it then they do not want to see what one really looks like
2947170 goebbels core philosophy based on a tabloid style populist approach was said to have been partly inspired by the ideas of the first lord northcliffe
2947171 to conduct propaganda in such a way that it will stand up to critical examination of intellectuals
2947172 intellectuals always yield to strength and this will be the ordinary man in the street
2947173 smarter minds than bush in the administration or advising the administration are quite happy with the increased talk and flutter about civil war in the media and the general population because this facilitates a face saving exit from iraq without first having to acknowledge and learn from the fact that an imperial oil war was the precipitating cause of this entire disaster

2947188 petra joy raadt aan om enorm veel tijd te investeren in het zoeken naar actrices en acteurs het moet klikken tussen de twee en ze moeten cht zijn ze gaat er prat op dat haar films siliconenvrij zijn de sfeer en de stijl zijn voor de vrouwelijke kijker heel belangrijk en daar besteedt ze ook aandacht aan er is plaats voor intimiteit creativiteit en humor de orgasmen die je ziet zijn echt er is geen gefake want de vrouwelijke kijker merkt dit
2947189 aan de hand van voorbeelden kregen we te zien hoe het moet en vooral hoe het niet moet petra raadde ons aan om minstens met twee cameras te werken eentje die de hele tijd draait en een andere waarmee je meer bewegingsvrijheid hebt en waar nodig kan inzoomen ze raadde ons ook aan om voldoende materiaal te schieten om achteraf de beste stukken uit te halen

2947206 re the global flood yes we all know that the mediterranean was flooded but that is not a global flood a global flood is impossible well not quite if all volcanic and tectonic plate movement were to stop right now i e no more mountain building then errosion given millions of years would eventually deposit all mountains content etc into rivers and ultimately the sea then and only then do you have any chance of a global flood somehow i cannot see tectonic plate activity ever stopping can you
2947207 they all take a very long time and certainly longer than this mythical 6000 years
2947208 another strawman argument says that sediments can be rapidly deposited well maybe so they can but sorry guys that does not mean that all or the majorityt of sediments have been laid down quickly lets take limestone which is basically something akin to coral like organisms dying and slowly building up layers well we can witness this today but we dont see these layers rapidly building up do we yet again a little piece of creationist information proves to be misleading which of course is the sole intent oh by the way if sediments can be rapidly deposited then that must be happening now and we should be observing the very formation of fossils
2947209 i notice you are still denying beneficial mutation even after the effort that arcana has made to point you in the direction of numerous examples of beneficial mutation how can you ignore this
2947210 anyhow all of this is wasting my precious time and i will have to sign off now
2947211 and i have pointed out that we have in fact seen increases in genetic information and have even given an example of a known mechanism for such increases much like your refusal to acknowledge transitional fossils your claim about mutations only losing genetic information is completely factually baseless
2947212 heres a rebuttal for mark izaaks stupid assertions regarding noahs flood
2947213 why should many fossils buried together come as a suprise and how does this disprove evolution rather it supports evolution but millions i think you are exagerating a tad
2947214 oh go on fusion make my day and challenge me on that topic please
2947215 global flood and frozen fossils in the arctic you really are rambling now i have already explained in simple terms that a global flood is impossible what on earth are you implying
2947216 why should many fossils buried together come as a suprise and how does this disprove evolution rather it supports evolution but millions i think you are exagerating a tad
2947217 put a joint of pork in a pork joint fully intact albeit the meat may have lost some of its flavour and be a bit tough
2947218 the berskovka mammoth frozen remains found in snow perfectly feasible and i remember the discovery of a mammoth in siberia not sure if it this one and it was almost fully intact mammoths have only recently become exinct so why and how does this disprove evolution put a joint of pork in a pork joint fully intact albeit the meat may have lost some of its flavour and be a bit tough yet again totally irrelevent content from this sham of a website in a pathetic attempt to discredit evolution i was going to label s8int as inappropriate but i think i have to use the word immoral
2947219 now if you told me that the fossil bones of a human were found in the same layer as those of a dinoasaur then that would at least be a challenge but i guess your creation scientists are still busy on trying to magic that one up in some remote region
2947220 in various levels of the muck stone artifacts were found frozen in situ at great depths and in apparent association with the ice age fauna which implies that men were contemporary with extinct animals in alaska
2947221 the horse is merely the tip of the iceberg giant tortoises living in the caribbean sea the giant sloth the sabre toothed tiger the glyptodont and toxodon these were all tropical animals they werent wiped out because alaska and siberia were experiencing an ice age
2947222 unless one is willing to postulate freezing temperatures across the equator such an explanation clearly begs the question
2947223 animal tusks and bones rolled up in front of the blades
2947224 as i said before if there had been a global flood there would be a uniform sediment layer and we would find fossils everywhere not just in these isolated locations
2947225 have you ever had your head out of a book long enough to look at a gravel pit or a stream bed has it ever occurred to you what conditions would be like with water above the continental shorelines going around and around the earth pulled by the moons gravitation and swirling due to the coriolis effect didnt think so
2947226 this is another red herring do you have an actual point that is relevant to the discussion what is it about these conditions you claim to have existed supports your claims
2947227 secondly the technology to make forged steel rivets wasnt even around at the time you purport that the ark was constructed
2947228 site medzamor in soviet armenia is of intriguing interest an international scientific report published in 1969 expressed the belief that these finds point to an unknown period of technological development
2947229 medzamor was founded by the wise men of earlier civilizations they possessed knowledge they had acquired during a remote age unknown to us that deserves to be called scientific and industrial
2947230 on putting the two parts together it formed a bell shaped vessel 4 1 2 inches high 6 l 2 inches at the base 2 1 2 inches at the top and about an eighth of an inch in thickness the body of the vessel resembles zinc in color or a composition metal in which there is a considerable portion of silver on the sides there are six figures of a flower a bouquet beautifully inlaid with pure silver and around the lower part of the vessel a vine or wreath inlaid also with silver the chasing carving and inlaying are exquisitely done by the art of some cunning craftsman this curious and unknown vessel was blown out of the solid pudding stone fifteen feet below the surface
2947231 immense volumes have been written to expound our knowledge and conceal our ignorance of primitive man primitive cultures were not necessarily the ancestors of our own for all we know they may be the degenerate remnants of higher cultures

2947243 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2947244 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2947245 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2947246 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen

2947251 initially i was a bit uncomfortable with a high tech grave but now i have come to see it positively
2947252 looking at their pictures i actually talk a lot more to my deceased parents and sister
2947253 i thought it was okay to bring the practice of visiting a family grave up to date with technological advances
2947254 temples are so separated from society today but thanks to this high tech system people have turned their attention to the buddhist memorial service

2947256 unfortunately the trend is only set to grow in the worsening economic climate
2947257 with the price of rental accommodation going up at the rate it is and the scarcity of rental accommodation landlords are putting a blanket no pets policy across the board which is really unfortunate
2947258 we expect the storm will exacerbate food price inflation which hit 45 percent in july and drove headline inflation to 27 percent
2947259 unlike the rest of the region where we forecast cpi inflation peaking in the current quarter we expect vietnams inflation to continue to accelerate

2947297 different growing conditions can have a significant impact on nutritional content of produce
2947298 were seeing remarkable differences certainly more significant than we expected
2947299 the substances that make carrots orange and tomatoes red and also account for flavor and nutrient content
2947300 and that makes sense plants produce antioxidants and other phytochemicals to protect themselves from insect infestations plants grown organically have to work harder to fend off pests
2947301 different plants have their own unique complement of defensive compounds
2947302 which may explain why some respond more than others to differences in their environment
2947303 spinach grown organically may start out with higher levels of some nutrients
2947304 but if its stored overnight and then carted a hundred miles in an open truck on a hot day it may end up having lower levels than conventionally grown spinach thats frozen as soon as its harvested
2947305 all of us would be healthier if we ate more fruits and vegetables no matter how theyre grown

2947318 the real beginning of my career as a distinctive type of wall street operator dates back to 1915 with the dissolution plan of the guggenheim exploration company

2947334 to win two british opens back to back is quite an achievement but to win two majors back to back is absolutely incredible
2947335 to become the first irishman to win a major in the us ensures his place in sporting history and legend
2947336 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2947337 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2947338 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2947339 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2947340 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2947341 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2947342 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2947343 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2947344 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live

2947346 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2947347 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2947348 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2947349 the review process demonstrated there was broad support for a reduction in the number of teams in the air new zealand cup however the hard part of that decision is having to consider which teams would not be included in the competition
2947350 its a bail out for an individual and i do not believe council should be getting involved in that
2947351 it almost beggars the mind in terms of the lack of any kind of amp i mean it looks like amateur hour
2947352 the council couldnt find any extra money for that but when a property developer gets into financial difficulty they can suddenly find 17 million and they make a decision in three days
2947353 one minute they havent got any money and they have to increase the rents the next minute they find 17 million to buy properties to bail a person out
2947354 its not a bailout its a council stepping in to make sure that we get the right and appropriate outcome on some very important central city sites
2947355 the market is now well off its peak of late 2007 early 2008 with many sellers accepting the state of the market and dropping their expectations accordingly
2947356 as a result we are seeing an increase in activity in the market although sales levels are still well below last year and long term averages
2947357 this as always will be driven by market demand and the age old factors of numbers of buyers versus numbers of sellers and perceptions of when properties represent fair value
2947358 weve had the big boom through 2002 2004 and its trickled on a bit over the last few years but now were seeing it adjust itself

2947420 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
2947421 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
2947422 the hospital auxiliary has long been dear to my heart
2947423 my mother was a charter member i went to church and school with several current members and many were role models for me as i grew up individually and collectively its members have been the driving force behind projects that have enhanced our lives for over half a century
2947424 we had a second crew for about a month in january to see if there was a call volume for it
2947425 from the feedback we got from the first responders they could see a dramatic change
2947426 has a collection rate of 3 percent over the national average
2947427 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue

2947429 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2947430 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2947431 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2947432 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2947433 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2947434 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2947435 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2947436 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2947437 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2947438 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2947439 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city

2947445 influencing goes beyond word of mouth into conviction it is not about simply passing on information but about passing on the experience linked to real belief of the brand promise
2947446 frankly word of mouth is not new to marketing it is only now being defined as a key for brands that have niche appeal and cannot always employ mass media to get their messages out there
2947447 they are mostly long term loyal consumers whose reason for use of the brand is tied to the long term relationship that they have had with the brand
2947448 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2947449 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2947450 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2947451 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2947452 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2947453 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2947454 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2947455 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2947461 bullying of this kind can be quite insidious it can just be a look that a child is given
2947462 children feel under immense pressure to look right and having the key brands is part of that
2947463 advertising and marketing have made our society increasingly image conscious and our children are suffering the consequences schools and colleges should be places where all children feel equal but it is virtually impossible for schools to protect their pupils from the harsher aspects of these commercial influences
2947464 the need to belong in groups is paramount to young learners and exclusion is something they see as the end of the world
2947465 young people are image conscious and a lot of bullying is based on appearance targeting others for not having the right look accessory or brand is unfortunately all too common

2947481 ha visto dice ironica una signora sui 50 anni siamo una citt attenta ai turisti
2947482 ero gi pronta per andare al mare con marito e figlio quando allimprovviso un dolore fortissimo alladdome spilli in tutto il corpo e mancanza totale di forze mi hanno costretta a rinunciare
2947483 pensavo fosse la cosa peggiore quella di stare su una barella per 4 ore con dolori fortissimi in un ingresso dove solo una tendina mi divideva dalla porta automatica che si apriva e chiudeva in continuazione azionando ogni volta un getto di aria condizionata che non ha certo giovato al mio stato ma il peggio arrivato dopo la visita medica con la flebo che andava a manetta mi sono ritrovata sempre sulla solita barella a questo punto dopo 5 ore con la schiena a pezzi stipata in una stanza da tre con i separ regolamentari dove gi cerano 14 persone 7 barelle pi un famigliare a testa con le suole delle scarpe di un uomo anziano proprio in faccia e un ragazzo con i suoi genitori seduti attaccati a me che mi alitavano su viso e corpo a distanza ravvicinata una sensazione indescrivibile peggio delle bestie solo dopo diverse lamentele con le infermiere che si sono giustificate dicendo siamo in un pronto soccorso bisogna avere pazienza le cose sono tornate alla normalit i pazienti sono stati destinati ai reparti dove li aspettavano per il ricovero e la ressa si dimezzata lasciando il posto alla decenza al rispetto della privacy

2947505 i need to convey that on wednesday march 7 2007 early before dawn i left home full of responsibility for the job that i cherish as a pilot he said
2947506 there was not even the tiniest intention in me at that time to deliberately execute my job carelessly and irresponsibly
2947507 i would be happy if i could help all passengers reach their destinations safely this is what ive been doing successfully in my 22 year career as a pilot
2947508 despite my intentions there was the accident which caused victims
2947509 heavy burden for him and his family who had already suffered the freezing of his flying licence his unemployment and harsh community opinion
2947510 i feel proud of my profession as a pilot and this job is the only source of income for my family marwoto said
2947511 my family and i feel very sad and struck that this incident has been considered a crime and i have been charged

2947514 after we carefully read the prosecutors indictment in this case the blurring of the indictment material especially in the formulation of the charges is obvious he told the court
2947515 not the authority of the criminal court to resolve the case and it should be handled by a special aviation court
2947516 the indictment made by the prosecutor is inaccurate unclear and incomplete and there is a mistake in the application fo the law assegaf said
2947517 we consider the indictment does not have any significant grounds as a starting point to be examined in this court so it is proper and feasible that the indictment be aborted or at least stated as being unacceptable

2947569 he has defamed the court and so hes gone for good
2947570 he is quite an emotional fellow and he has lashed out very often in the past

2947602 dua itu victory artinya kemenangan dan juga sebagai lambang bagi kita untuk melaksanakan keseimbangan pembangunan baik pembanguan disegi material maupun inmaterial
2947603 kita bukannya bertahayul dengan angka dua paling tidak dengan diraihnya angka dua ini akan memberikan suport atau dorongan bagi kita untuk memenangkan pilkada kerinci nantinya
2947604 kita sudah menargetkan dalam dua minggu kedepan sudah selesai seluruhnya
2947605 bagi kita bagaimana tim bisa mengerti tentang visi dan misi serta menjelaskannya kepada masyarakat sebab tujuan kita semata mata pulang ke kerinci merupakan panggilan hati nurani untuk membangun kerinci
2947606 cukup dengan mengingat sholat lima waktu 5 rukun islam serta 5 sila pancasila
2947607 that is about the funniest call it as i see it piece of truth ive read in a while and the comparison of edwards morals to gw bush was just fantastic oh what a way to make my day gimme more
2947608 teacher what is the most important commandment in the law
2947609 jesus replied you must love the lord your god with all your heart all your soul and all your mind
2947610 the fear of man brings a snare but he who trusts in the lord is kept safe
2947611 everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry for mans anger does not bring about the righteous life that god desires
2947612 it would take a whole lot more than this to actually get me angry now in this situation what can i do to help make it better
2947613 a gospel concerned only with how to deal with sin and death with wrongdoing and its effects weve got the past covered past sins are forgiven weve got the future covered heaven when we die but what about the present life our actual daily existence is strangely absent from the modern version of the good news
2947614 if youll just express belief in these facts about god you can be sure that when you die youll go to heaven nothing you do or dont do will change your position with god after you agree with the four facts once you pray them youre in so now go to church and enjoy the great plans god has for you
2947615 we are too apt to rest in a bare profession of faith and to think that this will save us it is a cheap and easy religion to say we believe in the articles of the christian faith but it is a great delusion to imagine that this is enough to bring us to heaven those who argue thus wrong god the most plausible profession of faith without works is dead we must not think that either without the other will justify and save us this is the grace of god wherein we stand and we should stand to it
2947616 and he died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again
2947617 religion that god our father accepts as pure and faultless is this to care for widows and orphans in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world
2947618 was god there absolutely he was when he first made me we were so happy together i could walk with him in the cool of the day talking with him and reporting to him about how things were going on earth he gave me a woman to love and we planned on starting a family in the garden when well thats when i blew it but god was still there in fact he came walking just as he always did and asked me why i was hiding god was there all along after all i was the one who ran away not him
2947619 wow id have to say yes god was always there for me
2947620 without a doubt god was there hes been there every step of the way for me even though ive failed him many times from the day he promised to bless me my life has been changed by the power of his presence he was there to guide me to the land he promised my descendants he was there to give me victory in battle he was there to help me increase my flocks and herds he was there to provide a substitute sacrifice on the mountain god is and has always been there we must simply trust him
2947621 for a good portion of my life i doubted that god was really there i was faithful to serve him even when everything was going wrong it seemed that he didnt know or didnt care enough to help but everything became clear the day i was pulled out of the dungeon and put in charge of the land of egypt in order to save millions of lives including those of my family i know now that for those lonely days in the prison cell the mindless labor as a slave and even that fearful night i sat in a dry well waiting to be sold into slavery god was there
2947622 if you could have seen how we were handed victory after victory even though we werent doing much fighting you would agree too that god was there as long as we israelites remained faithful to his covenant with us he would be there guiding us by day and night and after we entered the promised land giving us victory on every side we truly can be strong and courageous because jehovah shammah is with us wherever we go
2947623 the physical world is not the real world the spiritual world is and no one sins in the spiritual world only in the physical world
2947624 if evil is an illusion it is pointless to try to improve the conditions of life hence the destitute would be left to starve the sick left to die there would be no need to have hospitals schools and universities learning would cease and a new dark age would descend upon the earth thus we reject this view that evil is an illusion as inhuman impossible and irrational
2947625 take your evil deeds out of my sight stop doing wrong learn to do right seek justice encourage the oppressed
2947626 sin entered the world through one man and death through sin and in this way death came to all men because all sinned
2947627 everyone who sins breaks the law in fact sin is lawlessness but you know that jesus appeared so that he might take away our sins the reason the son of god appeared was to destroy the devils work
2947628 do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit who is in you whom you have received from god you are not your own you were bought at a price therefore honor god with your body
2947629 i cant have two tokens you mean i have to wait in this line again to come back

2947636 forging strong relationships with students facing the textbook scramble is the key to our success
2947637 while the high cost and buying process of college textbooks is debated in the us congress and at universities nationwide bookrenter com offers a real life solution to a big problem the speed with which we reached our 15 000th customer attests to the market need of a book rental service and our ability to deliver what students want
2947638 its very surreal to be sitting in bed with a cup of tea listening to yourself on such a prestigious radio station as bbc radio 2
2947639 we would like to thank all the musicians who collaborated with us and hope that we gave the listeners a spiritually uplifting start to the day with our edited and ethereal version of leonard cohens hallelujah
2947640 wow ryan you dont seem like your normal jovial self today
2947641 but surely that would have to involve me walking up and down the royal mile in a dinosaur costume
2947642 you must not seek to promugate truth nor to establish righteousness by the power of civil governments or by the enaction of secular laws human minds but you must never dare to compel them
2947643 we are totally responsible for our every thought word and deed while on earth and karma both positive and negative ensures that we re balance all the energy or matter so called sin we have ever disturbed
2947644 no debt in the universe ever goes unpaid there is a perfect accounting system in this universe and everything is a constant to and fro exchange of energy

2947654 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on us russian relations
2947655 we need russias co operation over iran and derailing that over a localised conflict in georgia makes no sense we just have to hope that diplomacy prevails the next necessary step is for russia to respond positively to georgias ceasefire declaration
2947656 but bush at least in public is now bound to be cautious calling for a ceasefire
2947657 i look forward to the early conclusion to current negotiations on a comprehensive free trade agreement between australia new zealand and asean
2947658 in the lead up to the target date of concluding negotiations at the asean economic ministers closer economic relations ministerial in singapore on august 28 australia is involved in intensive bilateral negotiations with key asean countries to finalise tariff and services schedules
2947659 would be an unambiguously good thing for australia but also for asean countries and the region generally
2947660 australia regards the completion or the conclusion of a free trade agreement with asean and nz as being very very important
2947661 but its also important in the aftermath of the regrettable collapse of the doha talks in the last couple of weeks that we have a regional success
2947662 australia and indonesia are both working very hard at negotiating well to bring such a treaty to a successful conclusion which australia would very much welcome
2947663 there is significant room for growth in our economic partnership if we do more to remove barriers to trade
2947664 in all challenges indonesia can count on australia to work with it as a friend and partner

2947673 the russians seem to be going much further in their military activities both in south ossetia in abkhazia and beyond

2947678 there is a continuation of dictatorship managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
2947679 i was in front of targets behind targets over targets and under targets it was really a mess maybe i was too relaxed

2947687 i didnt like that baz from the minute johnnie introduced him he was trying too hard to be a gangster just like his lovely mates who are always punting moody pills and what have you theres no need for that kind of business in the sort of clubs we go to the big places for the tourists like camden palace are fair game but not the more select venues what do your reckon paul
2947688 ive never wanted to be involved with gangsters id knock it all on the head if i had to deal with them they forget the idea is to have some fun not just make money too greedy too much dirty money involved its just a matter of time before a bigger fish comes and eats the little fish

2947698 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
2947699 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive

2947713 as a male sport we tend to hide our feelings a lot said ball
2947714 but there was definitely a moment where guys let out how they felt about hugh not being on the bench

2947746 the credit crunch has turned out to be bigger and broader than at first appeared likely the fact that inflation has been running so far above target has meant the bank of england has not been able to cut interest rates

2948052 i particularly want to take this opportunity to express my deep concern for the pig sector which i know is going through an immensely difficult time as a result of the huge rise in feed costs
2948053 there is a growing awareness of the problem and those retailers who are raising their prices should be congratulated however little if any of the increase is being passed down the chain to the farmer and unless urgent action is taken this countrys pig sector which has never received subsidies could be decimated
2948054 despite rising costs in production the supermarkets are not raising prices enough at the till we are currently running at a loss and will not be able to sustain this for much longer

2948067 we are out on a business development side getting content partners that want to work with ultramercial and want to monetize their content in this way
2948068 we pitched them this idea to do this and they were so desperate that they said ok well do it
2948069 when we started with salon they had 38 000 paid subscribers
2948070 maybe after the fifth 50th or 100th ad a lot of people realized you know what im just going to subscribe and they did
2948071 anyone who gets through the ad in less than two minutes we believe theyre engaged
2948072 the will of the advertiser is only so strong once they make the ad but the ability to do that is there

2948090 it appears that at this point that given the size of our team we can only work on one mobile game at a time
2948091 we are probably partner up and the first iphone game will be one where we work with a publishing partner
2948092 it does raise the bar on what you need to do from a game standpoint
2948093 with the iphone the experience what you are going to be doing in games has to rise because there are so many other things you can do with it
2948094 i dont think we have to worry about invisible people walking around any time soon to be honest we are just at the beginning of doing anything like that
2948095 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive
2948096 when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
2948097 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface
2948098 what we have done is taken that material and made it much thicker
2948099 there is some sincerity and some snake oil in every politician but john edwards exudes both in almost freakish measure
2948100 maybe slippery john somehow convinced earnest john that this moment would never come in fact it was inevitable and if edwards had somehow won the democratic nomination the party would be in the midst of a historic meltdown
2948101 the stunning admission edwards made to abcs bob woodruff and in a written statement from chapel hill on friday afternoon was that hes a narcissist
2948102 he admitted that wallowing in self focus out on the trail and thinking youre special can result in a solipsism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and therell be no consequences
2948103 auto psychoanalysis by the perp thats really rich when bill clinton acknowledged an affair after equally adamant denials he simply went into an old fashioned spiral of penitence his allegedly long dark night of his alleged soul
2948104 even in confessing to preening edwards was preening his diagnosis of narcissism was weirdly narcissistic or was it self narcissistic given his diagnosis im sure his h m o would pay
2948105 the creepiest part of his creepy confession was when he stressed to woodruff that he cheated on elizabeth in 2006 when her cancer was in remission his infidelity was oncologically correct
2948106 hes not really very important in american politics right now but im afraid this will just deepen the cynicism that the american people feel towards politicians and politics
2948107 i think all of us agree that corporal punishment has no place in education
2948108 for one thing it is not an effective means of punishing children
2948109 in the time ive been in custody my business has been destroyed
2948110 to allow immigration agents to come into the federal and state courthouse and questioning people is really going to pose problems
2948111 im not going to say its fairly routine but its not out of the ordinary either
2948112 i found myself wondering if i could do better when i realized it was all coming together i knew i had to take it as far as i could but i never decided i was going to write for a living that just kind of happened

2948117 a few years ago former bsc basketball coach tony mandeville invited several of his players to a reception in princeton and the event was well attended
2948118 the ex players wanted to continue getting together from time to time
2948119 we had a tightly knit group in athletics back then and several of the basketball players also played football thats how the idea grew to include football players too
2948120 the reunion has mushroomed because guys are looking forward to greeting teammates they havent seen for many years
2948121 three more at our place and theyre a good team
2948122 they come out and swing the bats real well and theyve got good pitching so well try our best tomorrow
2948123 we struggled we left a lot of runners on at the beginning of the game
2948124 we had chances to open up the game right there and we still got a lead but when you leave that many people on base early in the game later in the game it is going to bite you and that happened
2948125 the temptation is there because theyre throwing at your hitters and the pitchers dont hit
2948126 its easy to throw at somebody when you dont hit
2948127 the easy way for me was to hit somebody on purpose right away but what are we going to do start a fight or a brawl or something like that and one of those young players maybe gets hurt
2948128 our intensity there in the third and fourth innings was pretty bad we kind of picked it up there in the sixth inning
2948129 we didnt come out ready to play in the first half of the game but we did a better job in the second half
2948130 eastham was kind of overthrowing he had trouble throwing the ball inside to people
2948131 he had really been scruffling in the last week or so so its real nice to see him come out and swing that well today
2948132 theyre a team that makes contact even with two strikes they put the ball in play and they use the whole field and you have to take advantage right away when you have chances
2948133 they also made four errors we had a chance early to bury them and we got buried
2948134 youre never pleased you want to really see the guys develop and do things right
2948135 i am very enthusiastic with the way they are coming out and the way they are playing the game
2948136 in this game you can never be pleased you constantly have to get better and better every day
2948137 you couldnt find a better place to coach than richlands this is a community that loves their football
2948138 when you come in here on friday night and see a 5 000 giant inflated helmet and you look behind you and that place is full our kids are spoiled they play every friday night in front of about 5 000 people whether they go on the road or play here
2948139 when we travel we have more fans than the home team 95 percent of the time you go on the road and youll have 70 cars pass you blowing their horns at the bus on the way down at 3 30 people getting there before us
2948140 they love these football players they love their football games
2948141 i teach at the middle school and the middle school kids and little league players idolize these players and theyve got a lot of expectations on them to be role models
2948142 you can tell theres a lot of pride in the community and they really support the football program
2948143 and if youre not winning theyll tell you that too
2948144 i was an assistant under billy haun george brown terry west and dennis vaught
2948145 you will not find better students that work hard people marvel about just how hard our kids work and theyre blue collar kids
2948146 they come out here every day and they like to hit anytime youre physical youre usually successful in football i dont think well have to worry about whether theyll hit or not thats a good sign
2948147 it all goes back to fundamentals if you look at our two deep chart i think on the defensive side weve got nine sophomores and freshmen on the second team and on offense i think there are six so were going to be very young on our backup positions
2948148 every time you do that youd better be fundamentally sound
2948149 and the practices weve improved each practice and thats all you can ask
2948150 our seniors understand each year that its their football team a lot of times well set them down and talk with them about certain situations theyre in control in the locker room they control the tempo of practice there are a lot of expectations on seniors
2948151 theyve seen these other seniors whove come through here be so successful and carry out those roles so theyve had great role models ahead of them and theyve done a good job
2948152 your seniors are the heart and soul of your football team theyre the leaders out there any time you play football theres going to be a lot of adversity how good you are as a football team is how you react to that
2948153 it seems like when youve got a lot of seniors theyre mature theyre able to handle setbacks mistakes fumbles bad calls theyre able to overcome those things
2948154 i guess the biggest thing to adjust to is these guys havent been in the system that long and dont know where theyre supposed to be last year i learned a lot from my receivers and this year i had to take a little more of a teaching role
2948155 i think its going to be tough but what ive got to is to dig down deep and do what i have to do to support my teammates and my coaches
2948156 its been a great run hopefully weve left a mark on the younger guys we have tried to teach the team what we can and hopefully we have passed the winning tradition on to them
2948157 syria with iran and turkey seek to form one political institution
2948158 could it be any better could i be happier is
2948159 i kissed a girl and i liked it the taste of her cherry chapstick
2948160 when i got to virginia tech i had to make some changes
2948161 i needed to flatten my swing and it took awhile to adjust but ive really started to play better over the past few months
2948162 i was a little nervous going into the final round of each of those tournaments
2948163 because it had been a while since id been there and i didnt finish things off in the last round the way i had wanted
2948164 ive still found time to play with my dad four time pocahontas champion charlie green during the week
2948165 my game is coming around with my new swing im able to work the ball right to left or left to right as the situation dictates and my short game has also gotten better
2948166 garland is one of the most competitive players on our team
2948167 he has a natural feel for the game as he continues to mature and adjust we expect garland to play a major role in the hokies future success
2948168 i want to stay in the fairways keep the ball below the hole on my approach shots and play smart
2948169 its good but i dont try to worry about it
2948170 i just want to get through this year and after that ill worry about everything else
2948171 i guess it snuck up on me in terms that i dont keep tabs on stuff like that
2948172 seniors want to come out here get better and compete
2948173 you lose a couple guys you get down about it but at the same time that gives the younger guys an opportunity to step in and fill a spot thats needed
2948174 with the young guys that we have coming in this year i feel they can make an impact in the secondary
2948175 with this being my last year ive got big expectations not only for myself but also for this team
2948176 i feel this is the year that the senior class will come in and turn things around and get it on the right path
2948177 ive worked hard and the mistakes have gotten less and less each year
2948178 ive did a lot of work in the weight room i come out three or four days a week and work a lot in the off season it takes a lot of hard work to be a good football player
2948179 you can be more aggressive and go after the defender the key is technique and coach hubbard works on our technique every practice its a lot of repetition
2948180 but he may just be the best of the bunch he is just flat good those five are the key to our football team if they play well well have a good team if not were not going to do much
2948181 i wouldnt say it was a painful season last year but it definitely wasnt 100 percent like i would prefer
2948182 i had to get it taken care of and hopefully i can get back to 100 percent
2948183 i havent been cleared from my doctor yet he said maybe around the middle of august
2948184 the first game is kind of iffy but thats something i am working toward im hoping to get in all the extra time i can
2948185 its going to be long season but as a player i dont think you want to miss any reps before your senior year
2948186 it was a dream come true but i was watching film on it in the meeting room the other day and dykes and dingle were doing a great job for me
2948187 ive also got to credit those guys i should have just given them the trophy
2948188 its hard to project its a long season and you dont know what is going to happen
2948189 obviously you want to make the loftiest goals for yourself set high goals and hopefully youll accomplish lofty achievements
2948190 right now we are going to take it week by week and day by day weve got to go through each practice and work hard but obviously our ultimate goal is the national championship and we wont be satisfied without it
2948191 losing johnny dingle and dykes thats huge dykes was my bodyguard last year a big guy so were obviously going to miss those guys
2948192 weve got guys that can step in make plays for us
2948193 theyre our linemen basically i compare us to the tailback running through the holes they open it up for you and you try to get back there and make a play
2948194 its just the defense and first of all youve got to credit those big guys up front
2948195 they do all the work for you theyre the guys doing the nasty work and we get the credit off of it
2948196 it is really a good defense it is different than anything else
2948197 its a tough go today last monday is the first day i got under some pads but they still wont let me do some of the live things
2948198 obviously im not 100 percent yet i still cant have that contact that im used to having right now and i miss it
2948199 it kind of stinks being on the sidelines away from all the contact and the action obviously being a linebacker that is something you miss
2948200 its been a process im trying to get the actual work in now
2948201 i didnt have the opportunity to play in spring ball so its been a while since ive been on the field so im trying to knock that rust off
2948202 you always have room to learn you have to try and better yourself where youre weak at and even where youre strong
2948203 that will make yourself a better player but weve got some different coaches and different things are going on and absolutely were learning things
2948204 from my standpoint i have learned a lot watching the younger guys get in there and play a little bit ive been more of a coach than a player in this offseason and its really helped me mentally on the field
2948205 obviously you know our offense is going to put up points they going to put up yards and theyre going to make plays
2948206 its up to us to try and keep up with them and keep pat white and noel devine and all those big guys on the field
2948207 you get them the ball in their hands and theyre going to score
2948208 youve got to take each game youve got to start with villanova

2948236 there are serious challenges as regards training infrastructure and all these issues after all afghanistan has faced constant conflict for the past three decades
2948237 the reform of the judiciary has gone really slowly norways foreign department has sent judges and state lawyers and prison officials to train the afghans but few other countries have contributed trainers for any part of the judiciary at all then there is a challenge as regards international jurisprudence and the afghan constitution which are not completely compatible as well as local traditions the elder councils and sharia laws
2948238 justice sector reform is central to efforts by the afghans and the international community to build a sustainable state founded upon the rule of law and a democratic system of governance but progress is affected by the security situation
2948239 last year almost a thousand policemen were killed in attacks by bandits and the taliban and if the mainly bandit attacks on help convoys across the country now begin to increase it will have an enormous effect on the general situation
2948240 there has been some progress with police reform after the united states stepped in with a teaching course right before christmas that is almost an exact copy of what they did with the afghan army the real delays relate to justice reform by which i mean the criminal justice system the courts the prison service and so on
2948241 in general the approach simply hasnt worked ddr was handed to japan and the police reform was meant to be germanys responsibility the u s took the army italy took justice reform and britain took counter narcotics but the whole process has been inadequately coordinated
2948242 we cant just blame the afghans for lack of progress with the reforms as they were handed a system that had been decided almost before it hit the ground to put it like that what is needed is local institutional capacity building the handing over of responsibility to afghans themselves were not the ones that are going to run the country after all
2948243 if you pump too much money into a post conflict area without having an administration and a bureaucracy capable of handling the funds you just get more corruption and waste
2948244 a precondition for the efforts at justice reform made by norway and the international community is that the afghan authorities actively combat the corruption that exists within the justice sector both centrally and out in the provinces
2948245 i cant be exactly sure what will take place on the ground between the justice minister and the world bank but i do have a feeling that everything is quite closely controlled internationally at the moment there are a lot of funds going into afghanistan but the government is only allowed to control a small percentage the rest is controlled by ngos and international organisations

2948264 some people think i am weak because i did not take the combative approach but this is a matter that must be handled carefully for a lasting solution
2948265 i have heard that some parents do not want to take their children to school for fear that the personal identification numbers given to them are demonic i appeal to all of you to come together and fight such ignorance

2948283 it is an offence to undertake mining in a protected area
2948284 you need backing of the law so that bunyoro kingdom does not only get a token the kingdom should get a share
2948285 the president should not say we shall find something for the banyoro you are the real owners of the oil
2948286 we need to consult dr congo and sudan over this

2948295 why oh why oh why is the structure of my chromosones
2948296 christmas for the last few years has been really productive
2948297 by the time i was 16 i felt very wimpy
2948298 i was at an all boys school so everybodys shouting jock voice hey whats up faggot the weightlifting gave me some kind of physical presence i remember two months into lifting weights this gradual thing of people not messing with me any more im like wow im not getting fucked with i really enjoyed that
2948299 when my fist connected with his cheek his teeth came through the guy was blowing blood and air out of the side of his mouth that was it for me i was kind of a made man after that the seniors respected me my own peer group respected me the teachers kind of respected me i didnt have a lot of hassle from that time on
2948300 the guy shot at me and missed but killed my friend and the next morning after the cops turned me loose i was cleaning my friends brain off the lawn
2948301 i had the remains of his head in my hands thats stuff you dont forget its probably had an effect on me some ptsd post traumatic stress disorder and thats probably added to me being on my own it makes relationships sometimes difficult
2948302 i knew a guy who was driving his tour bus for a time and i said whats the dylan bus like he said its just him his manager his dog and his chef as the last note of the last song is ringing hes already on the bus and gone hes out of there down the road
2948303 i understand that thing dylan still goes out and does 75 shows a year he doesnt need to do it its not like its a money thing in a way im in the same position im in no way bob dylan but i dont need the finances i just do it because thats what i do

2948310 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction
2948311 but they voted against it the road has no value its a state right of way were not planning on building a hotel on it
2948312 i sat here monday before the storm and clocked one at 83 mph one at 76 mph and another at 90 mph
2948313 early in the mornings and late in the evenings its like a racetrack
2948314 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
2948315 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
2948316 we are the only museum in this region of texas to host this exhibit
2948317 people in the galveston area should not miss this opportunity to see it and to participate by sharing their stories
2948318 in the world of knowledge every day something new is added in pursuit of the tao every day something is let go lao tzu
2948319 oh that answered the man that is simple i merely entered the water at the center of its whirl i let myself flow along with it not trying to impose my will upon it then i left when it whirled the opposite way it is all completely natural to me
2948320 who can be still while the muddy water settles who can remain still until the time comes for action
2948321 whats important is knowing when to do what and in what quantities
2948322 at this point we have worked together for so long
2948323 that our trust level is high knowing that you are only a phone call away when it seems like a situation would benefit from your coaching makes our hr program both more effective and creative we have sometimes called you in by design as a first response and other times we have brought you in to help with a difficult situation almost as a last resort but either way coaching has been a welcome and effective intervention with our executives and directors
2948324 since i worked with my coach for 18 months we had plenty of material to work with
2948325 from health and fitness to career development to relationship work we covered all the bases generating many
2948326 i was in my first year of employment at a new church and i wanted to make it the best year possible so i came with my goals in hand as to what i wanted to accomplish at the church much to my surprise i ended up with a whole new set of goals that were more life goals than ministry goals i came to see how the two worked hand in hand i spend more time with my wife and children now including family devotions and i write in my journal 4 5 times a week these were things i used to preach but failed to incorporate in my only daily habits now all that has changed i put people before programs coaching has led me to this place like a guiding light and it is really peaceful
2948327 because i frequently dare to be different its not uncommon for people to challenge me about my choices
2948328 thats why its been great to work with a coach who affirms me and who assists me to set and maintain healthy boundaries with those who challenge me and your support when my dad was murdered proved to be invaluable theres no way to say enough about how coaching has kept me going and moved me forward
2948329 one of the things i enjoy most about the coaching
2948330 is the orientation around spiritual practice it has me doing things in the physical world in order to get me connected to the spiritual world so we have developed an elaborate set of rituals which i practice faithfully on a daily basis in order to deepen my spiritual life given my health challenges those practices mostly take place within my home but they open my eyes to the movement of spirit around the world and throughout history because of coaching i am more thankful and happy to be alive
2948331 coaching was for me a highly personalized highly individualized and never
2948332 was my own personal tiger team we use that term to refer to a team that analyzes systems in order to identify hidden or heretofore unrecognized problems which might lead to performance declines boundary violations workflow interruptions and decreased earnings i needed someone to analyze my life that way before i made too many more compromises you embraced my big hairy audacious goal to reduce the dependence of the united states on fossil fuels and you have carefully worked with me to express that goal in my life and work i am still a long way from where i want to be but i am much closer than i would have been without coaching
2948333 our vision was to transform the fat family into the fit family
2948334 but we ended up with so much more than just fitness
2948335 and when we met we didnt just talk about the same old things
2948336 by joining together as a coaching group we became focused on health and fitness like never before so now when we get together for holidays or special occasions we eat differently and are more likely to look out for each other
2948337 we modified our environment as well as our habits in order to get going with new habits the weekly coaching call is a powerful accountability forum that assists us to do better all week long
2948338 i was working really hard and doing the program right and it wasnt working like it was meant to
2948339 it was stressing me out because i was meant to be losing weight and everyones looking at me and its all bad
2948340 i went to the doctor and my body doesnt digest certain foods well so i decided it was bad for them and i didnt want to do bad by them
2948341 people for some reason think i dont like women that are overweight sandilands said
2948342 but i want everyone to be the best they can be and if theyre fat then i say to them then they should lose weight
2948343 im fat myself i have to lose weight but every sunday i tell myself i should and ill start on monday but i dont
2948344 every year they come in and they say were used to performing with a band and an audience and this is a very different experience for us
2948345 so weve given them a band this year and a full audience so they s t their pants when they walk in with their band and their audience and they have to sing boom straight away
2948346 weve reacted to what the contestants have been whingeing about for a few years
2948347 its a much better idea than having a big band night who gives a s t about that id rather have a kelly rowland night or beyonce night or something a little bit fresh sandilands said
2948348 ive been talking about mentors for years im not talking your kate ceberanos im talking your big international stars like big international guests
2948349 you couldnt really get your teeth into any particular issue because there wasnt enough time
2948350 im a bit more open to something new and different and he isnt
2948351 if he cant relate to someone thats already been a musical success he cant really see where they fit
2948352 hes used to cloning artists whereas im for individuality something fresh and new
2948353 awalnya kami tidak mengerti apa itu itu mungkin ada di sistem tata surya kita atau di ujung jagat raya
2948354 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2948355 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2948356 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2948357 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2948358 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2948359 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2948360 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2948361 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2948362 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2948363 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2948364 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
2948365 to thrive in the 21st century service economy startups and old line companies alike must shift their it geeks to the front lines of innovation
2948366 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
2948367 i had to change my shirt every ten minutes it is difficult no

2948370 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2948371 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2948372 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2948373 its good to send a signal to the chinese people that we respect them that this is about their country

2948425 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2948426 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2948427 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2948428 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2948429 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2948430 too often we in the training field get stuck on how to train rather than on how to help our customers learn which in turn drives results which is the real goal our focus should be on learning not training
2948431 social learning compliments training and covers knowledge formal training was never able to reach it is in addition to without having huge amounts of formal resources needed to deliver
2948432 products that are in low demand or have low sales volume can collectively make up a market share that rivals or exceeds the relatively few current bestsellers
2948433 if we can make the tools that capture the knowledge lightweight and simple we can harness the collective knowledge and use it to our advantage the sharing then becomes a natural part of how an employee does their job
2948434 number one the training department didnt need to write it instead the employees taught each other how great is that ya it is not as pretty as a powerpoint presentation you may have given nor quite as polished but it was good information everyone needs to know and now anyone can find it
2948435 by implementing a social learning solution you sit on the control fence control to much and it wont be used but not controlling it at all is unwise there needs to be a balance enough structure and processes to give guidance yet enough freedom to allow the users to do what they want
2948436 leaving the meeting she walked by some cubes where she overheard one person describing an hr policy to the other person that was completely incorrect and the second person took it as gospel
2948437 there was a person who needed to accomplish a task to do so that person needed to use a piece of software they had never heard of let alone knew enough about to functionally use it it would take months to learn it and complete the task
2948438 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2948439 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2948440 stop hitting your friends or theyll stop hanging out with you
2948441 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2948445 the fact that russia is now going even beyond abkhazia and south ossetia bombing sites near to the georgian capital of tbilisi the fact that russia has mobilised at least part of the black sea fleet off the coast of georgia is entirely deplorable russian military behaviour
2948446 there cannot be a military solution to this it is absolutely clear
2948447 there are disputes about some issues territorial issues and authority issues in south ossetia and separately in abkhazia
2948448 but there is no excuse for russia bombing targets outside of those areas in and around tbilisi and also mobilising the black sea fleet to go off to the coast of georgia
2948449 there is an emergency meeting of all the foreign offices and foreign ministries of the 27 european countries this wednesday in brussels
2948450 and if that is the stated aim of russia there will be a very strong diplomatic international response to russia
2948451 we will continue to press for international action to help bring this conflict to an end and we urge both parties to agree an immediate ceasefire
2948452 bullying of this kind can be quite insidious it can just be a look that a child is given
2948453 children feel under immense pressure to look right and having the key brands is part of that
2948454 advertising and marketing have made our society increasingly image conscious and our children are suffering the consequences schools and colleges should be places where all children feel equal but it is virtually impossible for schools to protect their pupils from the harsher aspects of these commercial influences
2948455 the need to belong in groups is paramount to young learners and exclusion is something they see as the end of the world
2948456 young people are image conscious and a lot of bullying is based on appearance targeting others for not having the right look accessory or brand is unfortunately all too common

2948638 when markets collide investment strategies for the age of global economic change
2948639 in the old days if the us economy contracted the rest of the world would do even worse but today if the us contracts the rest of the world might contract by only half thats a fundamental change the wealth of the emerging middle class in countries like brazil india and china is becoming a force in itself
2948640 the typical us investor tends to have about 80 percent of equities in the us the world of tomorrow suggests a much greater exposure overseas in general you should consider holding a third of your equities in the us a third in industrial countries outside the us and a third in emerging markets
2948641 the world is changing and how we measure that change economically and financially is clearly a challenge and an opportunity we have seen a re weighting of risk around the world but the world itself is being economically re rated and so we need an index that allows investors to take advantage of these changes indian companies will obviously have a place in the global dow as will companies from other emerging countries where we have seen an unprecedented economic emancipation over the past two decades
2948642 the global dow will track the share prices of existing and future global leaders in every industry vigorous companies from emerging economies will be included along with companies from emerging sectors such as alternative energy
2948643 while we must reflect the global stock market as it is we must also recognize the rapid rise of companies in countries such as india we have already seen great indian companies acquiring famous brands such as jaguar and land rover but these developments are just the beginning of a long term trend that will fundamentally change the international corporate landscape as with the dow jones industrial average the component choices for the new index will be based on the editorial judgment of the worlds leading business journalists that is dow jones journalists

2948786 clearly you can see that there are some white material exposed in the trench and there is a debate that it might be a salty layer or an ice layer
2948787 so we are quite interested in seeing the microscopic make up of the soil

2948931 war has broken out in europe a european nation has fallen victim to the aggression of its neighbor and the european union as the bearer of european values cannot remain a helpless bystander
2948932 we both understand that the european union faces a very serious and fundamental choice because the russian attacks against georgia unavoidably confront us with the task of reviewing several aspects of current cooperation between the european union and russia

2948939 the abkhaz side had moved troops and heavy weapons into the zone of conflict which had initially been prevented by the commonwealth of independent states cis peacekeeping force
2948940 we must condemn the military assault on a sovereign state including the targeting of civilians and the campaign of terror against the georgian population and condemn the destruction of georgian infrastructure

2949009 not the authority of the criminal court to resolve the case and it should be handled by a special aviation court
2949010 the indictment made by the prosecutor is inaccurate unclear and incomplete and there is a mistake in the application fo the law assegaf said
2949011 we consider the indictment does not have any significant grounds as a starting point to be examined in this court so it is proper and feasible that the indictment be aborted or at least stated as being unacceptable

2949122 what the fuck why did i play through this game then
2949123 von einem guten morgen kann man ja nicht sprechen nachdem jetzt schon wieder ein neuer krieg losgebrochen ist
2949124 ja ich finde es auch schrecklich vor allem dieses kuddelmuddel da in georgien
2949125 was liegt diesen georgiern eigentlich an ossetien die h lfte davon geh rt sowieso zu russland die meisten s dossetier haben sich russische p sse beschafft weil sie lieber zu den russen geh ren wollen und s dossetien hat sich von georgien unabh ngig erkl rt man versteht es wirklich nicht was die georgier von denen wollen ob es da um geld geht bodensch tze l
2949126 aber dann h tten die russen doch auch schon irgendwelche schritte unternommen s dossetien an sich zu bringen
2949127 eben das ist ja das merkw rdige auch jene drei igtausend s dosseten die sich in den neunziger jahren beim vorigen krieg nach tiflis gefl chtet haben werden ja nicht gerade gut behandelt sie sind heute noch nach siebzehn jahren mehr oder weniger obdachlos
2949128 auch die abchasen wollen nichts mit tiflis also den georgiern zu tun haben
2949129 ja nur die wollen unabh ngig sein vermutlich auch von den russen die nutzen einfach die chance da die georgier jetzt damit besch ftigt sind die russen abzuwehren es ist vollkommen unverst ndlich was da vor sich geht warum greifen die georgier aus heiterem himmel die s dosseten an rufen dann den sicherheitsrat um hilfe und hauen ab als die russen ihnen paroli bieten
2949130 man w rde w nschen da die russen das gebiet annektieren damit ruhe ist vielleicht wollen die georgier ja auch russland treffen indem sie die osseten schlagen
2949131 eben es ist von vornherein klar da georgien gegen russland keine chance hat denn die situation ist doch etwas anders als damals in afghanistan selbst wenn es nur ein versuch sein sollte russland schaden zuzuf gen den gr ten schaden tr gt georgien selbst davon man kann das drehen und wenden wie man will es gibt keinen sinn in der ganzen geschichte
2949132 geltungssucht sieh her welt wir bieten dem russischen b ren die stirn
2949133 der er dann mit seiner pranke einen blutigen scheitel zieht
2949134 womit die russen als die b sen da st nden
2949135 die welt ffentlichkeit hat quasi zugesehen als georgien zuerst angegriffen hat den schwarzen peter k nnen sie russland nicht in die schuhe schieben und wenn die rechnung war da w hrend der olympischen spiele niemand hinsieht so war das eine milchm dchenrechnung so dumm kann doch dieser saakaschwili nicht sein
2949136 dazu ist er nicht m chtig genug es ist ein r tsel schon damals 1991 habe ich nicht verstanden was die da eigentlich umtreibt ein krieg gegen russland kann f r georgien nur nachteile bringen l hin oder her im gegenteil wenn es den russen zu dumm wird nehmen sie den krieg an und erobern ganz georgien
2949137 wed hoped that was the beginning of an opening in the democratic space
2949138 but the political space is contracting again its clear the ruling party is determined to stay in power by any means
2949139 i dont think the political space is in any way being constrained
2949140 they dont claim they want a socialist state but the ideology is still there
2949141 the international community espouses ideas about good governance transparency and human rights but then they help a regime that flouts and violates those fundamental rights
2949142 i dont think the american people or the congress are going to accept decreasing food when there are photographs from ethiopia of starving children
2949143 they are going to ask why arent you helping these starving kids

2949181 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2949182 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2949183 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2949184 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2949185 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2949186 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2949187 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2949188 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2949189 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2949190 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2949191 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2949192 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2949193 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2949194 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2949195 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2949196 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2949197 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2949198 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2949199 it was probably the greatest rocknroll swindle of the 1970s
2949200 thousands of people bought the single little realising they already had the track
2949201 if only more people had taken a little more time and effort to listen to the b side they could have saved themselves the 79p they paid at the record counter
2949202 its really amazing because we dont have any restrictions like language problems or sexual problems we can do anything we want and were really out there
2949203 in my episode we had an orgy im doing drugs all the time im smoking grass im having orgies hey its music its rock n roll baby its gonna be an eye opener
2949204 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2949205 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2949206 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2949207 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2949208 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2949209 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2949210 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2949211 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2949212 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2949213 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2949214 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2949215 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2949216 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2949217 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2949218 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2949219 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2949220 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2949221 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2949222 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2949223 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2949224 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2949225 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2949226 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2949227 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2949228 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2949229 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2949230 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2949231 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2949232 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2949233 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2949234 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2949235 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2949236 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2949237 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2949238 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2949239 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2949240 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2949241 who are open to doing something on the production side
2949242 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2949243 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2949244 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2949245 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2949246 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2949247 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2949248 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2949249 in the time ive been in custody my business has been destroyed
2949250 to allow immigration agents to come into the federal and state courthouse and questioning people is really going to pose problems
2949251 im not going to say its fairly routine but its not out of the ordinary either
2949252 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2949253 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2949254 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2949255 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2949256 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2949257 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2949258 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2949259 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2949260 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2949261 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2949262 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2949263 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2949264 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2949265 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2949266 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2949267 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2949268 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2949269 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2949270 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2949271 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2949326 the results of the survey so far show that although most companies understand the importance of having business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place there seems to be a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding the technologies that are currently available to deliver reliable and fast recovery in the event of a system failure these days it is not enough to blindly trust that backups are being completed properly businesses and the regulatory environment in which we all exist demand fast and reliable recovery time objectives for it systems such is the pace at which a modern company transacts business these days that those who are without their it for any great length of time are losing serious money customers are also becoming a lot more aware of the information that companies hold and are getting less and less forgiving about delivery disruption let alone the thought of their sensitive data being transported in a an unencrypted and readable format
2949327 this change in causes of data loss can possibly be attributed to improvements in software and hardware resiliency in the last two years which has reduced the number of hardware and software failures affecting computers changing the way these threats need to be addressed in business continuity and disaster recovery plans moving forward

2949393 with a system of education that puts up the elite good education was never designed for the masses
2949394 this is why were having all these problems in education because the idea at the root of it represents a finite idea that has to end in order for something new and better to come in
2949395 we are delighted to welcome our new stakeholders into the dme they rank among the worlds most successful and sophisticated financial institutions and energy trading firms and their vote of confidence in the exchange is indicative of the success the dme has achieved to date as well as the strategic positioning of dubai as a financial hub bridging the time zones of europe asia and the united states
2949396 the addition of our new partners into the exchange marks yet another milestone in the development of the dme the desire of these institutions which form an important part of the financial and energy trading community to join the exchange as equity holders and strategic partners highlights the remarkable progress made by the dme to date in establishing an internationally recognised futures exchange
2949397 the strategic partnership with the dubai mercantile exchange is consistent with our commitment to the region
2949398 the dubai mercantile exchange not only offers strong potential from an investment perspective but also constitutes a strategic partnership that will develop our footprint in the middle east
2949399 a successful and liquid futures exchange linked to energy products in the region will help us to better manage some of the risks inherent in our own business and those of our clients we believe that the ongoing economic growth and development in dubai and wider gcc region will continue to drive the success of the dme delivering return on investment as well as enhanced opportunities for our global client base
2949400 vitol has been involved with the dme since its inception and we are delighted to have the opportunity to make a further commitment to the exchange by means of this equity purchase we have always held the view that the region needs a new price discovery mechanism for middle east crude oil destined for the eastern markets we believe that a regionally based futures exchange is the optimum way for the market to determine the value of middle east sour crude in a transparent and reliable way we remain confident that dme oman prices can be used by other producers as well as oman and dubai to price their crude and also that the dme contracts will become a very useful and powerful hedging tool for traders and refiners we congratulate the dme and its founder shareholders on their progress to date and looking forward to supporting and sharing in their further success in the future

2949459 genau hinzuschauen unter welchen bedingungen produkte hergestellt und gehandelt werden
2949460 dass man seine br tchen beim backdiscounter kauft der keine soziale verantwortung bernimmt der weder ordentlich bezahlt noch lehrstellen schafft wie die kleine b ckerei an der ecke
2949461 diese g nstigen preise wurden auch auf dem buckel der besch ftigten in der nahrungsmittelindustrie erwirtschaftet durch leistungsdruck und arbeitsplatzabbau
2949462 we are of the view that fees should be finalised by the concerned iim boards what is the use of the board if we have to decide on the fee structure
2949463 the basic thrust of the committee is to study and suggest the roadmap on how to create excellence and expand management education
2949464 iims have to raise funding from outside in the us the b schools get funding from corporates the iims can look for similar things here
2949465 now things have changed a lot the economy is growing at eight to nine per cent there is heavy attrition rate in the market each company is trying to attract the better talented professionals by giving huge salary so we will study how to deal with the situation
2949466 the iims are giving the required training to the people no doubt but we will examine if the iims need to expand their activities and perform a larger role to impart required skill to people and enhance the human capital
2949467 every company is looking at its human resource needs that other institutions are not able to provide
2949468 education is a sunrise sector investments in this sector are limited but the returns are very promising this is why even companies are finding this interesting
2949469 we are out on a business development side getting content partners that want to work with ultramercial and want to monetize their content in this way
2949470 we pitched them this idea to do this and they were so desperate that they said ok well do it
2949471 when we started with salon they had 38 000 paid subscribers
2949472 maybe after the fifth 50th or 100th ad a lot of people realized you know what im just going to subscribe and they did
2949473 anyone who gets through the ad in less than two minutes we believe theyre engaged
2949474 the will of the advertiser is only so strong once they make the ad but the ability to do that is there
2949475 i thought what if while that little progress bar showing me how my song is downloading what if an ad ran right then
2949476 she did get napster to stop but along came kazaa and bittorrent and nothing changed

2949479 thats the good thing about the olympics its been a lot of fun
2949480 its good to send a signal to the chinese people that we respect them that this is about their country
2949481 its just a very energetic feeling they represent the best of usa athletics theyre full of hope
2949482 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2949483 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
2949484 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
2949485 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
2949486 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2949487 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2949488 the court has some very genuine concerns about the nature and efficacy of these claims
2949489 in 1964 the scripture read as follows know ye not that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminates nor abusers of themselves with mankind in 1982 the same scripture read do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexuals
2949490 do you not know that the unrighteous and the wrong doers will not inherit or have any share in the kingdom of god do not be deceived misled neither the impure and immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor those who participate in homosexual behavior
2949491 we need a new president in order to get this passed
2949492 this is about the right of everybody to be treated equally with respect
2949493 we obviously didnt dive very well as you could probably tell it was disappointing but it was a great experience
2949494 unfortunately i dont have another chance im a little bit disappointed
2949495 im happy with the way i dived it was a great experience to get out there in the olympic games and unfortunately we didnt place where we could of placed
2949496 i m not going to have to worry about him because somebody else down south is going to take him out
2949497 if that man is elected president he ll be shot sure as hell the hate would be so deep down south
2949498 the kkk or someone will assassinate obama if we get a n president all you n s sic will think you ve won and that the white people will have to bow to you f that
2949499 people on these racist and white supremacist websites are being quite careful because they know that if they make a threat they will very likely get a visit from the secret service
2949500 the scary thing out there is the lone wolf phenomenon there are enough crazy people in this movement that it is possible one of them will decide today is the day to kick off the aryan revolution
2949501 we are looking at every possibility and making sure that we have prepared for every conceivable contingency if someone is threatening violence we will go to great lengths to deal with that
2949502 that brings the dark knight to 441 5 million edging out shrek 2 for third place on the all time domestic charts by next weekend it should pull ahead of star wars its unadjusted numbers anyway for second place titanic still remains out of reach or at least it seems that way right now
2949503 we have their phone numbers but we havent been able to reach them these are people we know and we are all hoping for their success
2949504 the military bases where we trained the soldiers are practically gone the russians have been bombing them over the past few days
2949505 the bases where we trained the forces were not in the areas of conflict but its not a huge country and the russians are bombing bases in central georgia and in the area of the capital tbilisi
2949506 it looked interesting relative to israel the money was excellent too
2949507 there was an atmosphere of war about to break out we received basic background about tensions between georgia and russia but most of what i learned came from talking to the soldiers from my point of view the battles of the past few days were to be expected
2949508 israel ziv and gal hirsch would come from time to time and watch us in action but we managed day to day operations ourselves
2949509 its not the standard we know in israel but when we left them they were at a good level they took the training very seriously there is a wider age range than in israel from 18 to 35 but they function very well over the past few days ive been following the news and i think they grasped a little of how to use strategy like we taught them it looks like we did a good job
2949510 we taught them counterterror and house to house fighting but that was very basic
2949511 i dont think the georgians would start fighting as long as the israeli forces where there
2949512 once when tension was high after russia shot down a drone we were evacuated to tbilisi
2949513 we were at some of the soldiers homes for dinner theyre very emotional and warm and tried to compare the situation in israel to their situation they were very excited that we had come to help them
2949514 when we found ourselves in a similar situation we expected the world to act differently
2949515 the israeli police intervened and we are assisting them with their investigation of the incident
2949516 increasing tension between peace groups and settlers who live in the central historic part of the town
2949517 the peace groups say theyre trying to show the negative impact of the israeli occupation on local palestinian residents
2949518 for the settlers hebron and its ancient sites is inherently jewish and is somewhere they have vowed to remain

2949586 yeah jeff this is geoffrey here just to take oil brent crude average price as of this morning lets say 124 125 at todays level it is still higher than our average cost during the first quarter the average cost in the first quarter was around 122 im using crude as a reference point and we are already towards the end of the first month of one third of the quarter so if you use an average rate for the third quarter of lets say around 125 126 then you are talking about over 0 5 billion additional cost for the company to absorb

2949589 anche tu mi manchi tanto che ieri sul lungomare mi era parso di vederti stavo camminando quando vedo girato di spalle uno che balla in modo concaresco corro ad abbracciarti e solo quando ti abbraccio mi accorgo che non sei tu era una statua di marmo con la testa ricoperta di sale che dava lo stesso riflesso azzurro dei tuoi capelli mentre il gioco di luce del sole sul mare mi faceva sembrare la statua in movimento come sei rapido tu nel tango e il marocchino che aveva appoggiato la sua merce sulla statua la rendeva dei colori di come solo tu sai vestirti

2949592 cada vez m s la gente los recuerda especialmente los torneos son importantes realmente cuando los ganan los que est n arriba uno de entre los diez o quince mejores del mundo esto no ha ocurrido todav a en los juegos no porque los buenos no hayan jugado sino porque les han eliminado pero son muy importantes sin duda

2949603 what is the most commonly used camera for wildlife photography by professionals
2949604 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2949605 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2949606 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2949607 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2949608 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2949609 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2949610 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2949611 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2949612 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2949637 today i felt the pressure for the first time in my career as an athlete and i wasnt able to deal with it
2949638 i was very surprised we were in the gym i asked him if i could i take a picture with him
2949639 he said hows your leg you are in my heart i hope everythings coming on
2949640 i texted my mother and told her she was shocked
2949641 the crowd was chanting ko be ko be and i wanted to get next to him so i would be on tv
2949642 we can assume a couple of those plays over the last couple of weeks wouldve been touchdowns
2949643 when he gets the ball in his hands in the open field i think theres always a chance
2949644 were going to use a number of running backs and the starter as far as im concerned will be the guy who plays the first play in the game not because one has earned the privilege to start over another it will be based on what we decide to do as an offensive staff to start the game
2949645 obviously were going to have two players and as i look at it its going to be lendale and its going to be chris were going to change them out throughout the game and back them up
2949646 were working to try to create a situation offensively where we get to raise the stress factors on defense
2949647 you have to put players in position to create mismatches thats what were working for

2949654 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2949655 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2949656 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2949657 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2949658 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2949659 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2949660 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2949661 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2949662 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2949663 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2949664 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2949665 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily

2949667 hay decisiones que requieren tomarse en estados de alerta propios del pensamiento fr o y racional del pesimismo no en estados de euforia y que demandan ser precavidos y tener en cuenta todos los riesgos otras situaciones en cambio se benefician de pensamientos positivos y optimistas de tener la moral alta confiar en uno mismo y borrar de la mente dentro de lo razonable las previsiones negativas sobrevaloradas

2949686 the price to be paid by arcelormittal will be calculated based on the amount of iron ore and manganese reserves in situ assessed according to the code for the reporting of mineral resources and ore reserves of the australasian joint ore reserves committee jorc
2949687 this investment represents a continuing development in our strategy of upstream integration securing supplies of iron ore is an important part of that strategy and will contribute to the future sustainability of our business
2949688 arcelormittal also plans to make additional investments to increase mpps iron ore production capacity in the short term
2949689 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
2949690 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
2949691 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well
2949692 we believe the story line of ultra low cost notebooks will increasingly be sidelined as the notebook market continues to offer a better solution and experience at price points similar to what ultra low cost notebooks are hitting
2949693 you are dealing with something which most of us wouldnt use

2949747 the russian people and russian politicians are two different things
2949748 if we want to have a stable situation there why just russians lets bring somebody else from ukraine or europe to stay there and control the situation
2949749 if we are wrong have somebody else there to exit russians and control the situation
2949750 you cannot call it the stupid georgians doing something because its our territory we dont do one step out its inside our territory
2949751 the situation feels like russia wants again to occupy our territory everybody in the world says this is georgian territory and they just want to control of it we are ready to do anything to finish this one we want to just control our small territory that we have
2949752 the georgian tanks fired at everything they saw including women and children

2949755 lets state clearly that we are ready to put an end to the war that we will withdraw from south ossetia that we will sign an agreement on non use of force
2949756 sadly there have been recent foreign office cuts to vital peace and reconciliation efforts in the region
2949757 it is essential that humanitarian agencies be able to reach the affected and the displaced and that those trapped in conflict areas be granted passage to safer areas as soon as possible
2949758 this could ease the pressure on the bank of england and that may leave them in a position to cut rates which will support the economy sterling has comne under pressure recently on the growing view that the bank of englands hands were tied by slowing growth and rising inflation
2949759 there was no violence no tension big crowds and sunshine all day long
2949760 with the combination of a pageant as well as the parade it gave tourists a good opportunity to see the reinactment of a historical event

2949782 nos parece superador el proyecto de expansi n urbana que se presenta de tener nuevos espacios de tierras para lotear mediante el convenio con mar a behety porque da alternativas de soluciones habitaciones y todo lo que ayuda en esta crisis es una verdadera soluci n concreta
2949783 desde el concejo vamos a ver como positivo lo que se encare con una visi n superadora en infraestructura tierras y dem s porque no solo es construir sino que hay que pensar en lo servicios b sicos para las viviendas hoy nos encontramos con un problema en chacra 13 y no se puede tener a la gente como reh n de las expectativas que se generan y hay que cubrir esas expectativas con acciones y estamos viendo las obras que contemplaran la infraestructura en chacra 13 sin vertido de l quidos al r o y es bueno poder ver que proyectamos con una soluci n especifica y ordenada sin especulaciones ni apremios de tiempo
2949784 estamos estudi ndolo porque estos fondos que quieren retener al municipio se pueden volcar en la ciudad en infraestructura para otras obras en marcha y futuras urbanizaciones como la de la zona de mar a behety seg n el proyecto existente considerando la distinta situaci n de ushuaia y r o grande porque en la capital la ley es muy practica pero en nuestra ciudad las necesidades son diferentes
2949785 en parte comenz cuando el municipio hizo la propuesta del tendido de redes en el concejo por los efluentes cloacales de chacra 13 y se plantearon varias obras posibles en el corto plazo para mejorar este sector y urbanizar otros sectores de la ciudad con fondos propios
2949786 al pedido de afectaci n especifica del recupero de la deuda del gobierno para infraestructura es viable y traer a un caudal de dinero importante para afrontar obras de esta magnitud
2949787 tenemos una visi n m s completa de los que se pudo hablar en legislatura y queda muy en claro que r o grande ha avanzado much simo en referencia a ushuaia y a la provincia misma en cuanto a invertir en lo habitacional
2949788 creo que la situaci n es una cuesti n a discutir entre los bloques pol ticos del concejo y el ejecutivo ya que el municipio en su conjunto concejo y ejecutivo han volcado recursos en la soluci n a la crisis habitacional por ejemplo con chacra xi o el canje de terrenos para que esto se logre
2949789 esto ha sido analizado por legislatura y han observado la idea que tenemos de que toda la deuda del gobierno sea afectada a lo habitacional y esto los llev a dejar la puerta abierta para la adhesi n de los municipios sin una cuesti n impuesta
2949790 si nosotros evaluamos la posibilidad de recuperar las deudas y afectarlas espec ficamente a infraestructura quiz s no ser a necesario adherirnos al fondo creo que es una cuestiona discutir
2949791 estamos evaluando todo lo que tiene que ver con la adquisici n de tierras y soluciones habitacionales o soluciones a esta gran necesidad de los vecinos estamos en vistas de una proposici n de canje tierras para hacerse de 15 hect reas y esto obviamente es seductor y de hecho hablamos de casi 400 lotes muy cerca de chacra 11 y que se vincula con el proyecto relacionado con el troncal cloacal y por ese sector se plantea el tendido de esta obra de casi 12 millones de pesos lo que lleve a solucionar esta crisis estaremos acompa ando y trabajando para ello
2949792 estamos hablando de una situaci n que creo que nace como una sana iniciativa como las que se han intentado volcar en esta cuesti n pero analizando la situaci n de rio grande nosotros tenemos necesidad de terrenos y con esta obra que se plantea es necesario observar la posibilidad de adhesi n a mi me quedan dudas para ver si es que no se est reteniendo los fondos lo mismo creo que es una herramienta m s
2949793 la soluci n a la crisis habitacional en tierra del fuego llegar si hacemos esfuerzos en conjunto de acuerdo y sin hablar de retener fondos o mucho menos sino que hablo de acuerdos solo as vamos a salir m s r pido de esta crisis no con cuestiones como estas que por ah intentando resolver los temas lo complicamos m s

2949836 de reducering van de methaanproductie is volgens de onderzoekers dan ook een aantrekkelijk doel om op korte termijn de opwarming van de aarde te bestrijden maar de onderzoekers geven toe dat een omschakeling naar de teelt van kangoeroes niet gemakkelijk zal zijn

2949857 normally a small earthquake might last less than a second a moderate sized earthquake might last a few seconds this earthquake lasted between 500 and 600 seconds at least 10 minutes
2949858 i think it was humbling for everyone that analyzed the earthquake
2949859 were sitting in our laboratories working on the signals from this earthquake trying to understand what happened scientifically and then watching tv at night and seeing the death toll rising for weeks
2949860 globally this earthquake was large enough to basically vibrate the whole planet as much as half an inch or a centimeter everywhere we had instruments we could see motions
2949861 wed never seen signals from an earthquake of this size and the availability of this instrumentation was a real breakthrough in being able to see the complete rupture process of one of these truly monstrous events
2949862 two hours after the earthquake has occurred the wave is spreading out from the bay of bengal
2949863 two satellites went over with the capability of measuring the elevation of the ocean surface
2949864 it was just good luck that the passage of the satellites caught the tsunami in motion
2949865 there will be more earthquakes of this type and with more humans exposed to the hazard there will be more devastating losses of life what we hope to do is develop technologies that can minimize that loss
2949866 it is clear that russias current leadership is bent on restoring a neocolonial form of control over the entire space once governed by moscow
2949867 when this failed the kremlin turned its attention to south ossetia ordering its proxies there to escalate attacks on georgian positions
2949868 my government answered with a unilateral cease fire the separatists began attacking civilians and russian tanks pierced the georgian border we had no choice but to protect our civilians and restore our constitutional order
2949869 yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia
2949870 and above all it is a war over the kind of europe our children will live in let us be frank this conflict is about the future of freedom in europe
2949871 no country of the former soviet union has made more progress toward consolidating democracy eradicating corruption and building an independent foreign policy than georgia
2949872 worked hard to peacefully bring abkhazia and south ossetia back into the georgian fold on terms that would fully protect the rights and interests of the residents of these territories
2949873 while we appealed to residents of abkhazia and south ossetia with our vision of a common future moscow increasingly took control of the separatist regimes
2949874 the kremlin even appointed russian security officers to arm and administer the self styled separatist governments
2949875 if georgia falls this will also mean the fall of the west in the entire former soviet union and beyond
2949876 leaders in neighboring states whether in ukraine in other caucasian states or in central asia will have to consider whether the price of freedom and independence is indeed too high
2949877 if the ultimatum is rejected all necessary enforcement measures will be used

2949935 depicting me as a manipulative liar they said i was the same as those who say 9 11 was an inside job
2949936 we defended against the al dura lie now its time to go on the offensive and get the french media to pay the price for supporting an anti semitic lie
2949937 seven years for seven years a despicable campaign of hate has been trying to stain the professional honour of charles enderlin for seven years there have been those who have tried to present as fabricated and as a staged scene his report that shows how a 12 year old boy was killed by shots fired from an israeli position
2949938 personalities who are worried by the fact i was not found guilty they say there is no right to defame and the justice system is allowing me to defame him thats not true the judge found there was no defamation
2949939 the french people aware of the case are on board with me
2949940 im not talking about most of the journalists the anti semitic politicians and the so called french intellectuals
2949941 the french media lied about the fact we won the case
2949942 the french media are all complicit in this kind of behaviour anti zionism anti israel which leads to anti semitism
2949943 france is still the most anti semitic country in the western world and it is very annoying to see that even when we can prove they were manipulating theyd rather lie and cover up the mistake of their colleague than tell the truth
2949944 i think if we did that at the moment when we do not know 100 per cent that ccs is going to work the engineering has not yet been tested and no one is fully aware of what the costs might be then that would put an end to coal fired power stations and demonstration plant and people would build gas again
2949945 i dont want to exaggerate but gas comes from some fairly unstable parts of the world and some not readily associated with human rights and democracy
2949946 if as some kind of gesture we said no to new coal fired power stations we would be in a very difficult position of not being able to develop this ccs technology ourselves

2949950 hes always been confident in his ability but hes just come along so much with the more first grade games hes played
2949951 hes consistently been in there now the last couple of years and i think hes getting smarter with the way he plays his footy
2949952 theres no doubt were going to miss toddys football brain and what he added to the side but weve had to move on as a group and i think terrys shown that hes ready to step into that leadership role especially in the halves
2949953 it seems the more pressure hes been under the better hes got hes still only a young guy its pretty exciting
2949954 were pretty aware of our situation we have a couple of losses in the next few weeks and all our hard work comes undone

2949974 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
2949975 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth
2949976 it confirms that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
2949977 many of these bacteria have not been described because they are quite hard to grow in the lab and when you go further down into the digestive system it gets even harder to do this
2949978 these bacteria are thought to have an involvement in dental caries and other mouth problems so describing them gives you a broader picture of the causation of these
