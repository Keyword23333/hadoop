130011 people looked at yesterdays frenzied rally and realized the fundamentals werent there to support it
130012 my food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work
130013 i moved north about 25 years ago for a couple of reasons
130014 i wanted to try my hand at music up here and also to do some filmmaking and animation which i do for cbs on the early show four days a week the rest of the time i play music and chase kids
130015 when i was still living in little rock id play at the white water tavern and another jointon cantrell road
130016 it was called smileys and it was a biker bar a big bandito hangout and we kind of became the house band there most of the gigs ended up with a fight alcohol blues and bikers thats always a potent combination
130017 i hope that someday i can bring my whole band
130018 now ive started doing more original stuff playing in small theaters in upstate new york and out in new jersey im doing more listening type rooms coffeehouse things where my stuff is more of a mix of singer songwriter blues and americana im trying to play more for people that want to listen to the words ive also been hosting a concert series at a methodist church in new jersey where we bring in a regional artist once a month ive been doing that for a year
130019 i saw a guy sitting on a corner with his shopping cart
130020 and he had on a heavy winter coat and a parka and all these clothes and it was a powerful image the course of the song came to me right then as i drove home i felt like that song was given to me as it all came out at once it made me think how we dont know what people have been through and how they end up where they are
130021 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
130022 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
130023 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
130024 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
130025 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
130026 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
130027 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
130028 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
130029 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
130030 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
130031 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
130032 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
130033 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen

130105 it helps neither amy nor any impressionable fans to portray her as anything less than a physical wreck
130106 its desperately sad we dont know whether lisas so dangerously thick that she thinks this is help or whether she goes home looks in the mirror and it actually cracks in disgust at the crap she spouts if amy winehouse dies lisa will fart out some leaden prose about how no one could help her even though she did her best by paying the photographers who hound amy every minute of her miserable life lisa might even read this and think you dont understand addiction not realising that publishing wildly intrusive pictures of seriously sick people isnt a recognised treatment either its funny how shes always sticking in lines about celebrities taking responsibility for their actions when shes so utterly incapable of taking responsibility for her own ive taken the difficult decision to speak out because im terrified she thinks shes something other than a drain on society
130107 michael is exhibiting all the signs of a compassion ectomy and after last years lobotomy pals fear hes becoming addicted to surgery it might be because hes bald and self loathing and pathetically grateful for attention but there is a serious possibility that he thinks hes worth something im speaking out because i want him to get help before its too late
130108 even with supervised visits this bitch cant be trusted with her own kids
130109 her baby is playing with a lighter in front of her hes not but she is too worried about looking perdy to notice what the fuck hes doing shes not
130110 julian is in denial about what a poisonous little prick he is it might even be a medical condition but pals say he refuses to seek help he tells himself that only intellectual snobs could take issue with this kind of editorial line hell say our readers want to know about britney or were giving our readers what theyre interested in dont forget that last year heat printed a sticker of jordans disabled son saying harvey wants to eat me presumably that was originally justified on the basis that our readers would be amused by it so hes literally ceded editorial control of the magazine to people who laugh at disabled children its heartbreaking even sadder someone at heats job is circling celebrity body parts and writing the word ew across them theyre so ashamed of the way they earn a living that they lie to their parents that they work in animal porn

130116 that sort of proactive act or measure didnt come out of the blue

130152 the one thing the government can do is to make a very specific definition of prime for the purposes of uk covered bonds like there is in germany for pfandbrief
130153 covered bond investors are used to dealing with very commoditised and homogeneous instruments and the uk covered bond market currently allows too much leeway in terms of mortgage quality and structure

130183 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
130184 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done

130225 i wouldnt even be surprised if that in some polls that you saw a little bit of a dip as a consequence weve been out of the country for a week people are worried about gas prices theyre worried about home foreclosures so the reason that i thought this trip was important was i am convinced that many of the issues that we face at home are not going to be solved as effectively unless we have strong partners abroad
130226 the conviction gives his victims hope that he will soon be brought to justice for his crimes in haiti that included the murder and rape and other torture of thousands more
130227 we strongly condemn this decision by the defense ministry to allow new settlements in the west bank in the jordan valley this is not the interest of the israeli people and the israeli public to have new settlements while we are having negotiations with the palestinians about having the two states

130229 did you use did people say call sean call bill call whoever did you do that as a regular thing
130230 certainly certainly it wasnt necessarily something i was doing but it was something that we at the white house yes were doing and getting them talking points and making sure they knew where we were coming from
130231 no no this is important you were using these commentators as your spokespeople

130243 im here on this trip to reaffirm the special relationship between israel and the united states my abiding commitment to israels security and my hope that i can serve as an effective partner whether as a united states senator or as a president in bringing about a more lasting peace in the region
130244 these positions mean that there is no minimal hope to any change in the us foreign policy towards the arab israeli conflict and this means that we are in front of one american policy and the palestinian people should depend on their own and on the arab and muslim world in facing this opposing american policy which both the democratic and republican parties are adopting
130245 unless chevron is out of there the united states doesnt have the moral authority to tell other countries to get out
130246 regarding the conspiracy issue president morales addressed over the course of twenty minutes and with the aid of documents the political operation carried out and being carried out by the us embassy in bolivia the bolivian government president morales himself has requested the united states halt with its political conspiring in bolivia and instead has posed working together to conspire against poverty
130247 the question is do you want to play russian roulette with your brain i dont know that cell phones are dangerous but i dont know that they are safe
130248 this should outrage every american that fox uses hateful language to talk about the person who may be the first black president but the obamas are not the only targets foxs pattern is race baiting and fear mongering regularly focuses on black leaders black institutions and ordinary black people like when they used the solemn occasion of coretta scott kings funeral to call black leaders racist thats not acceptable its offensive to black americans its offensive to all americans thats why i wrote on my new album a song called sly fox watch what you watchin fox keeps feeding us toxin stop sleepin start thinkin

130252 i think its no use beating around the bush this meeting has collapsed
130253 thank god no deal was reached because the proposal under consideration would have exacerbated the serious economic food security and social problems now rocking numerous countries
130254 now hu jia has been in prison too on similar charges of subversion his trial was politically motivated completely unfair and he should be released immediately and unconditionally his wife is also a human rights activist she is being harassed by the police who are standing outside her home monitoring her movements she has a newborn baby born at the end of last year meanwhile her husband is in prison and he should be released
130255 fusion centers are part of a much larger trend here a trend of our nations movement towards a surveillance society where our every move and our every transaction our every communication is scanned and scrutinized for signs of quote unquote suspicious behavior and that that kind of vision for how to do law enforcement how to stop terrorism becomes a justification for really keeping tabs on all of us in our everyday lives

130266 it is decided not to ban the party the court decided to impose partial financial penalties the party will not be banned but everybody should evaluate the decision very carefully the decision should be accepted as a very strong warning for akp six court members voted yes four people voted for imposing financial penalties and one person voted for rejection of the case
130267 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
130268 similar to practices in other countries china is acting in accordance with its laws with regards to control of the internet according to chinese law the internet cannot be used to transmit information that is illegal such as promoting the evil cult falun gong or threatening national security so we hope that the media will respect chinese laws and regulations

130307 no peace process will be achieved either in this year or the expected years israel backed by america is not intended to give the palestinian people their basic demand by establishment of an independent state and for this reason we resorted to the military activities in order to push the occupation and to make an end by our alternative method
130308 please do not respond to questions or make any statements

130322 this is a guarantee to keep any more worker safety regulation from ever coming out this is being done in secrecy to be sprung before president bush leaves office to cripple the next administration
130323 what i think can change is the ability of the united states government and a united states president to be actively engaged with the peace process and to be concerned and recognize the legitimate difficulties that the palestinian people are experiencing right now and recognize that it is not only in the interest of the palestinian people that their situation improves i believe its also in the interest of the israeli people because it is going to be very difficult for israel ever to feel secure if you dont have some sense of opportunity and prosperity and stability with its its neighbors
130324 its the credibility of the us the interest of the us has been adversely all affected by the last three years of american policy that has wreaked havoc in the region we need re engagement but we need positive re engagement in ways that would curb israeli violations and would help produce a just and genuine peace

130343 the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture
130344 these documents supply further evidence if any were needed that the justice department authorized the cia to torture prisoners in its custody the justice department twisted the law and in some cases ignored it altogether in order to permit interrogators to use barbaric methods that the us once prosecuted as war crimes

130423 mohammed you know that greece is not a friend of israel you know that greece is a friend of the palestinians only the palestinians and not israel
130424 well i dont really care and thats none of my business its a country i have received an invitation from the parliament in greece and i went there to speak after or before i went to collect my prize
130425 mohammed is unconscious and he cannot at all do anything or sign any paper
130426 should i tell the dutch embassy they are waiting outside should i tell them to follow us and to come to the hospital tell them that mohammed is inside the ambulance
130427 listen its none of your business dont tell the dutch that mohammed is in this car just take him to the hospital and thats it dont tell anybody about what happened
130428 the former ambassador jan wijenberg said this is by no means an isolated incident but part of a long term strategy to demolish palestinian social economic and cultural life i am aware of the possibility that mohammed omer might be murdered by israeli snipers or bomb attack in the near future

130431 irans will and authority to the enemies that have threatened iran with harsh language in recent weeks
130432 we face with the iranians and so do our allies and friends a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology as to this point is still unchecked and its hard for me to believe that an american president is not going to want to have the capability to defend our territory the territory of our allies whether they are in europe or whether they are in the middle east
130433 this is not good for our republic nor for europe nor for peace and security all around the world people are against the radar for different reasons radar and missiles have no security nor defensive reasoning
130434 every military action causes a military response this is the fundamental rule this is what military people are about if there is a military action if there is a change in strategic posture there is a counter change of strategic posture you can read it in every military textbook so there is nothing surprising there are not even questions to be asked about
130435 we cant have a memorandum of understanding with foreign forces unless it has dates and clear horizons determining the departure of foreign forces were unambiguously talking about their departure we are waiting impatiently for the day when the last foreign soldier leaves iraq
130436 we have great confidence that the political leadership in iraq would not take an action that would destabilize the country
130437 let me first of all talk about the broader issue this whole notion that i am shifting to the center or that im flip flopping or this or that or the other you know the people who say this apparently havent been listening to me ive been organizing with churches for years in the community and so the notion that somehow thats me trying to look like im you know more centered more centrist is just not true dont assume that if i dont agree with you on something that it must be because im doing that politically i may just disagree with you
130438 the government is stonewalling again by not allowing americans private dollars to be paid to american lawyers to defend civil liberties
130439 the chinese government is using the opportunity of hosting olympics to showcase the china that the chinese government wants the world to see and cover up the china that the chinese government does not want the outside to see so we came here to reveal this china to the other side of the world and more than that we have to send a message to the international community
130440 after fourteen months of study including seven meetings around the country and interviews with more than forty experts on this matter our commission has unanimously concluded that the central law governing this critical decision that is the war powers resolution of 1973 is ineffective and it should be repealed and it should be replaced however with a better law

130443 what is your position on senator dodds pledge to filibuster a bill that contains retroactive immunity
130444 oh theres good faith reasons not to impeach or to criminally prosecute
130445 well there may be legal excuses as to why he did that
130446 well these are important intellectual issues that we need to grapple with and its really not fair to put them inside of a courtroom or talk about prison

130449 the new president who will replace president bush is not going to change his policy in iraq his policy will remain the same regarding the occupation and iraq will see no change i do not think that he is going to change anything because the us policy is clear to everyone
130450 if the iraqi government were to say if you were president we want a timetable for troops being removed would you agree to that
130451 ive been there too many times ive met too many times with him and i know what they want they want it based on conditions and of course theyd like to have us out thats what happens when you win wars
130452 mukasey is asking congress to expand and extend the war on terror forever anyone that this president or the next one declares to be a terrorist could then be held indefinitely without a trial
130453 he is charged with genocide complicity to commit genocide murder extermination cruel treatment torture etc its a huge array of crimes committed in bosnia and herzegovina solely between march and december 1992 when bosnians serb republic was declared and radovan karadzic was its president but also for the crimes that were committed in the country from 92 until november 1995 including the genocide in srebrenica
130454 if he is guilty he has to be arrested but he is less guilty than others but they are not arrested only serbs are being arrested
130455 as we sign this memorandum of understanding we all commit ourselves to the first tentative step towards searching for a solution to the country that is in a crisis
130456 highly coercive environments and conditions under which they were made
130457 i crossed an artificial line today because appalachia is my homeland and its life is being destroyed far faster than it can regenerate
130458 they handcuffed me and placed me under the sun for about three hours then they picked me up walked me for a little bit and shot at me i found myself on the ground they told me we are going to fire a rubber bullet at you and i did not imagine that this is how they were going to act to open fire at me while i am handcuffed
130459 this policy should be condemned internationally through human rights organizations and they should be punished via an international court and not an israeli court at the end of the day they will be released the officer after a month or two or a short period he is in prison in front of the media but not in reality

130470 we were trying to get to the bulldozers we were risking no one and it seems that with the return to tactics and strategies of the first intifada by this village and the movement against the wall it seems that the army is returning to the old commands as well of breaking arms and legs of demonstrators
130471 im here visiting with the good people of nilin on this the fourth anniversary of the landmark advisory opinion and ruling by the international court of justice ruling which as you all know requires cessation of building of the wall destroying or removing the part of it that had been built and also dealing with the issue as a form of colonization and settlement activity with all that comes with that with all that comes with that by way of violation of rights of palestinians including importantly human rights
130472 were very pleased that the judge recognized on the record that my father is neither a threat to the community nor a flight risk we are hoping that immigration and customs enforcement will do the right thing and release him
130473 im not going to retract any of it every word i said was true
130474 we are also sending a message to iran that we will defend american interests and defend the interests of our allies weve done that both by i think you know that in the gulf area the united states has enhanced its security capacity its security presence and we are working closely with all of our allies to make certain that they are capable of defending themselves and we take very very strongly our obligation to help our allies defend themselves and no one should be confused about that

130491 though the chinese have also recently begun investing in the countrys oil sector u s companies exxonmobil amerada hess chevron texaco and marathon oil have played the most significant role a report by the international monetary fund notes that u s oil companies receive by far the most generous tax and profit sharing provisions in the region congressional hearings recently revealed how u s oil companies paid hundreds of millions of dollars destined to state treasuries directly into the dictators private bank accounts a senate report faulted u s oil companies for making substantial payments to or entering into business ventures with government officials and their family members
130492 the irony of the relative silence of congress and the bush administration regarding the human rights abuses and the undemocratic nature of obiangs regime is that due to the critical role of u s economic investment and security assistance the united states has far more leverage over the government of equatorial guinea than it does over zimbabwe
130493 equatorial guinea receives u s government funding and training through imet which is international military education and training program in addition the private u s firm military professional resources incorporated mpri founded by former senior pentagon officials who cite the regimes friendliness to u s strategic and economic interests plays a key role in the countrys internal security apparatus

130497 what i saw was abhorrently graphic yet far too important for the world to ignore i present images that provide an uncensored view of a terrible event and some small measure of dignity to those who lost their lives
130498 how can things change if all that comes out of iraq are sanitized white washed images of war designed for mainstream media outlets who focus on making money not on the quality and truth in what they report
130499 im not worried about my own safety im here to do my job im here to document
130500 well theres nothing in the embed rules that say you cant show someone whos identifiable as a marine it says no identifiable features you know to identify that person from you know another person but actually showing an injured soldier or a dead soldier is not something that is barred in the embed rules
130501 by posting the images and your commentary you violated 14 h and o of the news media agreement you signed
130502 by providing detailed information of the effectiveness of the attack and response of us forces to it you have put all us forces in iraq at greater risk for harm
130503 the marines have not been able to prove anything that they have claimed against you

130512 interpreting after the largest ice raid in us history a personal account
130513 then began the saddest procession i have ever witnessed which the public would never see because cameras were not allowed past the perimeter of the compound driven single file in groups of 10 shackled at the wrists waist and ankles chains dragging as they shuffled through the slaughterhouse workers were brought in for arraignment sat and listened through headsets to the interpreted initial appearance before marching out again to be bused to different county jails only to make room for the next row of 10 they appeared to be uniformly no more than 5 ft tall mostly illiterate guatemalan peasants with mayan last names some in tears others with faces of worry fear and embarrassment
130514 i walked for a month and ten days until i crossed the river
130515 please dont tell anybody because ill be placed in quarantine and i wont be able to support my family

130518 well im old enough to remember my grandparents talking about the fall and the great depression of 1929 so i was concerned about the bank totally closing not being able to get the money that was the main concern because my wife and i are both retirees and this is you know savings that we depend on monthly
130519 i cant move my arms i requested medical care a long time ago you havent done anything about it
130520 no i mean they look theyre healing well to me you know im not a doctor but i think youre getting good medical care
130521 no im not youre not here i lost my eyes i lost my feet everything
130522 no you still have your eyes and your feet are still at the end of your legs you know
130523 now we know who martyred our two sisters we know who martyred the people of deh rawod and we know who martyred the people in kabul now this has become clear and we have told the government of pakistan that the killings of people in afghanistan the destruction of bridges in afghanistan are carried out by pakistans intelligence and pakistans military departments
130524 the bush oil policy is an attempt at mass deception by a white house that has for the last seven and a half years pursued big oils agenda of drill drill drill
130525 i just submitted an application requesting to the pre trial chamber number three to issue an arrest warrant against omar hassan ahmad al bashir for genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes
130526 lets not be naive its not going to happen in the next couple of days thats clear to us but its not the first time that a head of state sitting head of state has been indicted you will remember the examples of slobodan milosevic in 99 or taylor in 2001 who was also the sitting president of liberia at the time they were not arrested immediately but eventually when the international community threw its weight behind these arrest warrants
130527 to have the federal government disappear your marriage im sure will be painful and upsetting it really is something out of orwell its shameful

130532 alright you know what we wont come in there at the high rates we dont want to get on the radar screen in that respect well just come right under and well start to look for ways to make loans with lots of bells and whistles and lots of fees attached to them where we can come under the radar screen and start to create this kind of market of potential problems
130533 you know what if lenders go outside of their responsibilities they can be sued they can have to pay out they can lose certain amounts of money that they have counted on
130534 we dont like that we dont like to be accountable for what were doing
130535 we were able to do this because of these unregulated swaps
130536 you know what heres 300 billion to the federal housing association and they will be able to effectively insure those mortgages to the lenders
130537 you know were going to help you the banking system get through the mess you created and you know what we want more power to basically regulate you in the future because we didnt do it enough to begin with during the last few years while all of these problems were brewing
130538 i believe the man we need to meet the mortal need today is here he is experienced but has not lost his common sense or his ability to be outraged his conservatism is not the result of a studied philosophy but of common sense and personal observation his name is john mccain he might not be the right president for all times but he is the right president for these times
130539 well we cant let bear stearns fail because then all these people will lose their jobs and well have a domino effect
130540 ok well were going to help you out but were going to demand that you act more responsibly and were going to demand that you let us see what youre doing
130541 you know were not just going to help a few homeowners right now we need to change the entire system we need to make it transparent we need to make the legislation enforceable and we need to bring some control into whats going on and understanding of what we need to be looking for

130548 the goal is to end the presence of foreign troops
130549 rather than a breakthrough the g8s announcement on 2050 is another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now
130550 the world faces three simultaneous crises a food crisis a climate crisis and a development crisis the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such
130551 now the bush administrations new policy is to wait another ten years
130552 he loved the picture dont get me wrong but he just couldnt get over the war he wasnt joseph anymore joseph never came home
130553 i just feel this war has become so sanitized that it was important to show
130554 provided the enemy with specific information on the effectiveness of the attack
130555 france is one of the ten countries in the world with the highest number of endangered species mainly due to what has happened in its overseas territories and once again the risk of these numbers increasing in the european overseas territories is likely to increase with the growing threat of climate change
130556 the ticket was for trespassing he said if i came back into the plaza i would be arrested and taken to jail the sign says mccain bush now in a republican event why is that offensive why would republicans who voted for bush find it offensive that a sign says bush mccain or mccain bush

130559 with todays vote the government has been given a green light to expand its power to spy on americans and run roughshod over the constitution
130560 the fact is theyve just tested a missile that has a pretty extended range so my view in the first instance is weve been saying as weve talked about missile defense in europe that there is a real threat and it seems to me that the test this morning underscores that
130561 are we any closer to a military confrontation with iran
130562 but in terms of the missile test i see it as evidence that the missile threat is not an imaginary one and that those who say that there is no iranian missile threat against which we should be building missile defenses perhaps ought to talk to the iranians about their claims even about the distance and the range of the missiles that they test fired
130563 part of what we have to do is get the europeans the chinese the russians all to recognize that its in nobodys interests including irans i believe to have a nuclear weapon that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region and thats something that i intend to make a number one priority when im in the white house making sure they dont have that nuclear capability
130564 its time for action and its time to make the iranians understand that this kind of violation of international treaties this kind of threatening of their neighbors this kind of continued military activity is not without cost
130565 see barack been talking down to black people on this faith based i wanna cut his beep off
130566 if anything ive said in a hot mic statement thats attributed as distraction i offer apology for that because i dont want harm or hurt to come to this campaign it represents too much of the dreams of so many who have paid such great prices and im very sensitive to what that means
130567 my appeal was for the moral content of his message to not only deal with the personal and moral responsibility of black males but to deal with the collective moral responsibility of government and the public policy
130568 i simply do not feel it is appropriate to honor a person whose epitaph of government service was to have voted against or blocked every civil rights issue that came before the us congress his doctrine of negativity hate and prejudice cost north carolina and our nation much that we may never regain
130569 on the agenda is the necessity of a general pay increase salaries and pensions to compensate not only the constantly increasing cost of living but also inflation

130572 as you know fannie mae and freddie mac play a central role in our housing finance system and must continue to do so in their current form as shareholder owned companies their support for the housing market is particularly important as we work through the current housing correction
130573 we need more troops more helicopters better intelligence gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there
130574 john mccain and george bush both said that if iraq as a sovereign government stated that it was time for us to start withdrawing our troops then they would respect the wishes of that sovereign government and given that i think its also in our strategic interests it certainly strikes me that we shouldnt be writing a status of forces agreement for example that locks in a long term occupation
130575 its 7 00 in the morning its time for him to get up smell the coffee and know the american people are sick and tired of war were already in one quagmire in iraq we dont want another one in iran
130576 and when i got to washington i saw that public policy is really made in a room at a table there were real seats at the table well imagine what has happened to public policymaking now there is a real room with a window and a door and theres two seats at the table the window is for us to look through while our representatives make policy for us so we can see what theyre doing at the table one seat is for the democrats one seat is for the republicans now we dont know who did it but one of them put a lock on the door and slipped a key to the corporate lobbyists who can come and go at will and whisper what they want to democrats and republicans and the result is that we the people who pay for those seats and determine who sits in them want one thing but because the corporate lobbyists can come and go at will our values get overridden and our representatives give us something else thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre against the war and occupation but war and occupation still gets funding thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre against illegal spying on innocent people yet end up with a telecom immunity bill being signed into law thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre in favor of universal access to healthcare and no one supporting what the physicians nurses and healthcare really want and thats a single payer healthcare system in this country

130581 sometimes during campaigns rhetoric gets overheated and amplified my core position has never changed ive always been a proponent of free trade
130582 senator obama unequivocally opposes giving retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies and has cosponsored senator dodds efforts to remove that provision from the fisa bill granting such immunity undermines the constitutional protections americans trust the congress to protect senator obama supports a filibuster of this bill and strongly urges others to do the same
130583 you know progressives and liberals dont know how to play poker there has to be somewhere to go
130584 oh well well give you aid but we want you to privatize your water your electricity system hand the coastline over to resorts

130588 us presidential candidate barack obama talks about sixteen months that we think would be the right time frame for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
130589 artificially prolonging the tenure of us troops in iraq would cause problems
130590 sen obama conveyed that he is committed to supporting afghanistan and to continue the war against terrorism with vigor
130591 to see young people like this who are doing such excellent work with so much dedication and pride just makes me feel good about the country and i want to make sure that everybody back home understands how much pride people take in their work here and how much sacrifice people are making its outstanding
130592 the situation is getting worse here even worse than iraq if the us government sends more troops here the violence will increase for example when we see a group of us soldiers walking here it doesnt make us feel safe our afghan forces are capable enough to ensure the security of afghanistan the us government should focus on other needs of afghans not the military
130593 there have not been any changes to the lives of ordinary afghans the visits and presence of foreigners has not changed the lives of poor afghans i returned from iran after twenty years there i had the best life when i was in iran now i have work like an animal in my country in order to feed my family my life is worse now what is the benefit of these western officials coming and going
130594 you said he was the most extreme member of the senate i think is the quote
130595 you mean you really think hes an extremist i mean hes clearly liberal
130596 oh i dont know all i know is his voting record and thats what people usually judge their elected representatives by
130597 btselem received this morning footage filmed in the village of nilin approximately two weeks ago showing an israeli soldier firing a rubber coated steal bullet at a palestinian the palestinian has his hands tied behind his back and his eyes covered and the soldier is firing at him from very close range from approximately a meter and a half away this whole event happens in the presence of a high ranking officer a lieutenant colonel

130603 so today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within ten years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
130604 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

130614 its an eternal summer always set outdoors with archetypal characters and it looks like the missing link between tank girl and gorillaz
130615 it was the final thing we did together before we all ran away screaming after the tank girl film
130616 the 16s was a name that id had kicking around for a long time taken from glam band the sweets single the six teens it had nothing to do with the strip or characters but seemed to fit nicely
130617 despite minimalist art style and subtle humour it has been well received and has a number of loyal fans
130618 its part of a series ive been making sometimes they are topical like this one
130619 in one case a man inadvertently put his lock through another bikes frame
130620 when he came back his bike had been vandalised the other bike owner had bashed it up by trying to destroy the lock
130621 make sure the front wheel is secure and does not get in the way otherwise people might kick the wheel in or drive over it
130622 the fire brigade say there is nothing worse than falling into a bike because the wheels are so tangly
130623 cyclists use all sorts of neat design solutions and clever techniques such as pulley racks which can wheel bikes to the ceiling or suspend them above ground
130624 i wouldnt take a bike on a train you never know which ones you can take a bike on and getting stuck in an area where you couldnt would be a nightmare
130625 but it would be very useful if there was a section where they could be taken on the tube
130626 we need longer trains and longer platforms and designated carriages for bicycles like they do in germany and switzerland
130627 at the moment new office blocks cater for bike storage space for one in 20 employees but this is an old fashioned standard

130635 this decision means the president can pick up any person in the country citizen or legal resident and lock them up for years without the most basic safeguard in the constitution the right to a criminal trial
130636 contrary to everything the canadian public has been told about omar khadr the tapes do not show a dangerous terrorist but instead a frightened wounded canadian boy pleading for help from canadian officials instead of helping they casually dismiss his claims of abuse and mistreatment and tell him that they will do nothing for him
130637 we are hoping that the canadian public will recognize that you put aside any concerns of guilt or innocence that has to be determined in a properly constituted court which of course is not guantanamo bay and look at compassion as we feel the children have a special significance in society this kid has suffered enough this kid needs to come home this kid is not a terrorist
130638 i heard somebody say well its going to take seven years well if wed have done it seven years ago wed be having a different conversation today im not suggesting wed have completely created a you know changed the dynamics in the world but it certainly would have been wed have been using more of our own oil and sending less money overseas

130647 the reality is in africa every single day 6 000 people die from hiv aids alone another 7 000 people die from malaria another 2 000 3 000 die from tuberculosis if those numbers of deaths were happening in europe or north america we are convinced the g8 would long time ago have found the money to address these issues so we want to see the same kind of urgency

130677 as part of the war on terror for the first time in its history the united states has sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment american held captives making torture the official law of the land in all but name
130678 bad news the reason were not getting better intelligence part of the reasoning anyway is that about a third of the people are innocent
130679 do you know anything about islamic radicals do you speak arabic have you got any background in this area
130680 the allegation that i provided assistance in the process of torture is completely false
130681 i gave a three hour lecture sponsored by sere the survival evasion resistance escape branch of the american armed forces at the san diego naval base in may 2002
130682 i have not worked under government contract or any other contract on any aspect of interrogation or any aspect of torture
130683 i have had no contact at all with the american psychological association about their relevant policies most importantly i strongly disapprove of torture and have never and would never provide assistance in its process
130684 if psychologists have to be there in order to keep detainees from being killed then those conditions are so horrendous that the only moral and ethical thing to do is to protest by leaving
130685 i am ashamed we are even having this conversation of course waterboarding is torture
130686 if it was done to me i would think it was torture

130731 i kept playing the movie over in my head many times had i been pressured had i been stubborn today with the perspective of years behind me i feel it was my destiny i feel that i had to live through what i lived through that i had to find out what i found out i have a ph d in the farc that i hope will be useful to those of us who want to help with all this i think there are moments in life in which one is at a crossroads between what one wants to do and what one has to do
130732 i dont want to answer that question from an emotional perspective because this is such a big blow to the farc that it would be easy to say that the farc is destroyed i simply want to give you testimony of what i lived through since a year ago it has been hard for supplies to arrive we have had little to eat very little variety in the food no fruit no greens thats a signal that the logistics could be going through difficulty
130733 mindless u s support of a regime that tacitly allowed paramilitary groups to function should not be applauded nor should the hundreds of trade union leaders that have been murdered during the uribe presidency be forgotten

130735 i have always said that all options are on the table but the first option for the united states is to solve this problem diplomatically ive also made it clear that you cant solve a problem diplomatically unless there are other people at the table with you and that is why we have been pursuing multilateral diplomacy when it comes to convincing the iranians that the free world is sincere about you know insisting that they not have the technologies necessary to develop a nuclear weapon and were making progress along those lines

130756 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that

130759 as you know weve got a proposed policy change for homebuilts its come to our attention that some companies may be skirting the letter of the law by selling a kit that requires nothing more than two turns of a screwdriver for safetys sake we just cant allow that its not right and it circumvents the very safeguards that are put in place to protect everyone in the system when we say that 51 percent of the plane has to be put together by the builder and not the kit maker we mean it in my opinion 51 percent is appropriate the aim here of the policy change isnt to punish its for your safety and for the integrity of the system
130760 terry brings professionalism and an uncompromising passion for aviation to the x air team
130761 terrys success in running high profile and high performance aircraft training speaks for itself but an added bonus is the relationships he has developed within the insurance industry and their subsequent recognition of the benefit of standardized factory training
130762 we recognize that within the lsa category there is a great need for a standard to be applied to the training environment both at an oem level and at the general flight school level

130767 his vital organs are not functioning well and he has developed pneumonia
130768 he played a pivotal role in bringing together different political parties and changing the political scenario

130777 last time he did this he said he had travelled through southall with the new baharat coach company on his way to birmingham we think he may well have followed a similar route this time the last confirmed sighting we have of him is in croydon so we think he might have done the same thing again
130778 he was left at a temple in southall and so he might have been there asking questions about his parents now that his english is better as he is clearly desperate to find them
130779 he is a very appealing child and is very intelligent we believe when he was found he was being looked after in the community and were not ruling out that has happened again because he appears to be on his own they might be thinking they are helping
130780 he left quite a sad note for his foster parents and from that it is clear he is very distressed about not being able to see his parents

130902 whoever believes that liberating shebaa farms would put an end to the resistance is deluded this enemy would not leave us alone
130903 look at the way they treated the people who signed treaties with them look at what they did to former palestinian president yasser arafat
130904 the resistance would persist after liberating shebaa farms and after and after that
130905 from palestine to iraq to lebanon the resistance is victorious

130940 this legislation makes common sense changes to strengthen the equal pay act so that it will be a more effective tool in combating gender based pay discrimination
130941 equal pay is an issue of fundamental fairness but as families grapple with difficult economic times equal pay for equal work is often about daily survival for millions of families
130942 meanwhile the unemployment rate for women has increased more rapidly than for men
130943 women are more likely to have subprime mortgages and be affected by the foreclosure crisis many low wage women workers are single mothers with no other source of support for their families and closing the pay disparity could strengthen their households
130944 equal pay for equal work is a long standing principle of this country just as workplace discrimination is something that no one who values freedom fairness and justice can or should abide
130945 thankfully weve already got plenty of laws on the books to ensure the former and punish the latter laws that are clearly defined with safeguards in place to protect
130946 but the bill we voted on tonight sets out to intentionally blur those lines assigning the question of intent a lower priority than the number of lawsuits filed the amount in damages sought and how high the take will be for lawyers
130947 ambiguity in the law breeds litigation in the courts litigation as an end in itself not as a tool for acquiring justice its precisely this sort of ambiguity the bill we voted on tonight attempts to create broaden and institutionalize and those attempting to defend themselves against actual discrimination will have their justice delayed or denied because of it

130953 by rebranding to zain we are bringing together our african and middle east operations under a single strong and unique identity we believe the zain brand provides an optimal platform upon which we can build a top 100 global brand with the ultimate goal of better serving our customers it builds upon the success of our african operations and will propel the zain group towards becoming one of the top ten global mobile telecommunications companies by 2011
130954 we are confident that our african customers will embrace the vibrant and colourful zain identity as one brand we will be better positioned to offer customers more innovative products and services alongside the best network coverage on the continent
130955 it is really disappointing but what i wanted to do and what i know are right are two different things

130961 im really pleased to get rangi he is very quick has good skills is a hard worker and a strong defender
130962 we intend to be strong in the pivotal positions next year and while we see rangi playing primarily in the halves he can also do a job at hooker
130963 andrei is ready to move to tottenham now it just depends on zenit
130964 arshavin changed his decision about joining spurs due to excellent interest from spurs
130965 they are the one team that fully agreed his contract demands and ready to pay almost the full price that zenit wants
130966 juande ramos called andrei and described his vision of football and his vision of andreis future in the team
130967 ramos said that arshavin will be a key player of his team and he is highly interested in this deal
130968 spurs had the money for andrei all the time and their interest isnt new but zenit doesnt want to say that they have an official offer from tottenham but they have it
130969 i dont think the deal can be delayed until the super cup against manchester united because im unsure that todays arshavin can be useful for zenit
130970 i hope that zenit will collect themselves i know the high level of professionalism of zenits new president alexander dukov and his great personality
130971 we have certain contacts with tottenham but when they will conclude i still do not know
130972 tottenham have an interest in the player and i understand that the player has an interest in the club too

130987 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
130988 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
130989 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
130990 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
130991 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
130992 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
130993 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
130994 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like

131024 in yet another powerful showcase of twitters potential power as a disseminator of information today several people received the first information via the micro me
131025 hello hello hello beirut please dear get me beirut and hurry up please
131026 hello hello hello palestine please dear get me palestine and hurry up please
131027 i am thrilled with the news but i cannot help feeling bad about all the years i spent in beirut without being able to contact my family and relatives who are still in palestine
131028 i am not really sure of the reasons why the decision has been delayed for so long
131029 there is no security or political justification for keeping the phones lines with palestine dead resuming international calls has been one of the major demands discussed as part of the lebanese palestinian dialogue committee and was it was discussed with prime minister siniora repeatedly
131030 all palestinian requests take their time when discussed at the lebanese political table it seems every issue has to wait for the right circumstances to be solved
131031 the 970 code has existed for 15 years and it used by every other country in the world
131032 you have to refer to the lebanese government for this answer israel did not wait for the lines to reopen in order to hack into lebanese land lines and mobile phones
131033 after careful consideration the australian government has formed the view that the safeguards agreement is a positive step which will strengthen nuclear non proliferation efforts and is consistent with the non proliferation objectives of the nuclear non proliferation treaty
131034 the australian governments position remains very firmly that it will not supply uranium to countries that are not a party to the npt
131035 we will certainly have non proliferation considerations uppermost in mind
131036 we will also take into account the strategic importance of the arrangement to both india and the united states

131049 i want to thank my family for all their support under very very stressful conditions
131050 i need to try and get over this ordeal with my family
131051 we expected this to be a long legal battle but we didnt expect this date to come so soon
131052 these press conferences have to stop they got the wrong man hes not guilty
131053 there was not a reasonable prospect of conviction at this time
131054 i personally have not seen that much heroin in one location
131055 whether or not its something that has been going on for some time is unknown to us but it is definitely a significant heroin seizure one that isnt typically done at this level
131056 its our belief it was just the driver who was involved
131057 the streets have dried up substantially of cocaine but you can see from our investigation we got just about every type of drug involved from heroin to marijuana so its like a drug store here
131058 there was just not that much the quality really did diminish and the prices did skyrocket
131059 people were responsible to report to the person above them so they were quite sophisticated
131060 we did have from street level right up to high level
131061 we did see the process where the drugs would come in and then filter down through to the street level
131062 i am fairly satisfied but there are like in any negotiations sticking points that need to be unravelled
131063 two weeks may appear too short but it is not inflexible and i am sure that the facilitation will adjust as progress moves forward
131064 this national inspection campaign is also aimed at improving compliance in industries with high incident rates as well as the sectoral determination that regulates the basic conditions of employment for the sector
131065 inspectors are among other things checking for compliance with health and safety measures availability of risk assessment plans where required training of workers on health and safety issues and the provision of protective wear for workers
131066 aligning the departments are necessary because when we give people the land they need to be supported in terms of agricultural production
131067 if you approve the purchase of a citrus farm you may find that you are going to lose three years of harvesting because of a year delay for providing agricultural products
131068 this is not only negatively effects government but causes a delay in agricultural production
131069 it is our view that this move will iron out a lot of challenges that were hindering the pace of land redistribution
131070 we havent seen this kind of a demand for wood pellet and electric fireplaces since the winter of 2005
131071 we are filling orders as fast as we possibly can
131072 this time three years ago we had over 150 stoves and inserts in stock now i cant keep enough on hand what is shocking is how early our season has started
131073 our manufacturers are already reporting an increase in delivery times which is very rare for this time of year the consumer looking to put off purchasing these types of products until the fall will run into extremely long wait times for product delivery
131074 im just hoping the manufacturers can supply to meet the consumers demand
131075 at one stage lightning was coming from all directions and we lost all of our electrics and had the option of turning to shore or forging ahead we chose the latter and proved that theres a lot to be said for hanging in there when the elements get tough this is the perfect example of what can happen when you dont give up
131076 they worked hard and proved up to the test im proud of their efforts particularly as this was the first race for some of them we were so happy to cross that finish line and this is a good start to krakatoa iis blue water point score campaign
131077 the impact of geforce gpus on protein folding simulations was immediate and dramatic
131078 teams that are folding with geforce gpus are seeing their production skyrocket applying that kind of processing power to folding home changes the whole dynamic of the project and could significantly reduce the time it takes to carry out our biomedical research
131079 we saw the completed work double for our pc games hardware folding team as a result of many team members installing the nvidia folding client
131080 we are passing many teams every day and we have finally reached our goal of being one of the top 100 folding teams in the world

131082 as a worldwide leader in developing innovative products and solutions for its customers hcl recognized the need for and value of implementing industrys best change management software
131083 serena bridges the gap between the developers vision and managements perspective to provide visibility across the organization
131084 microsofts recognition of salesworks our proprietary solution for the retail industry is a tacit acknowledgement of its innovativeness world class technical sophistication and outstanding ability to deliver greater business value to our clients around the globe

131089 david has always been a huge fan of the show when he was a kid he watched it like a lot of people and knew all the characters he was more than happy to go on
131090 he loves dealing with kids and thought it would be a great way to get through to them he had a great time filming it a real laugh
131091 well i can play in the centre on the right and occasionally on the left side
131092 its a silly person with a butt like an egg
131093 mom what do you mean when you say i sound like a broken record
131094 you cannot amputate a toe fasten it back on with a bit of cloth and re attach bones tendons muscles and all this is the kind of hearsay that goes down well in a bar
131095 het is vervelend dat een dispensatiespeler op de bank belandt want je denkt dat hij ons juist sterker maakt toen ik hem selecteerde wist ik nog niet hoe het met babel zou gaan ryan zou aanvankelijk ook het ek spelen maar voor het toernooi raakte hij geblesseerd ik heb er ook niet op gewacht want ik wilde snel vastigheid nu volg ik meer mijn gevoel dan verstand je moet doen wat je vindt dat je moet doen
131096 hij stond na de wedstrijd ook met zijn ploeggenoot michael bradley van sc heerenveen in de lift en die vertelde dat hij net zijn eerste wedstrijd sinds vijf weken had gespeeld sibon reageerde gevat dat dit wel eens zijn laatste in vijf weken zou kunnen zijn hij is een grote realist
131097 in de praktijk kan ik het toch anders doen want je weet niet hoe het allemaal gaat uitpakken over het middenveld ben ik nog niet helemaal uit dat ontloopt elkaar niet veel
131098 nobody really asks them how theyre doing or if there is been a change in how theyre doing
131099 physicians seeing them for other medical problems seldom ask them directly have you thought your life isnt worth living
131100 people who are becoming more dependent on others or more limited in the things they can do cant always adjust to that
131101 if someones life has changed significantly look for a notable change in that persons approach to life
131102 its sometimes hard to distinguish their depression from their medical burden
131103 older males wont talk about it they think it shows weak character and they arent given license to talk about their feelings
131104 with the world war ii generation there is almost a masked depression they may tell everyone things are ok and theyve already made up their minds to kill themselves
131105 the biggest warning sign is when there is a change in function and somebody isnt doing the activities they used to enjoy doing
131106 you can see this either in a pretty short time frame or in a general decline
131107 its easy for a caregiver to empathize with those feelings and to normalize them
131108 sure we can understand why someone gets depressed but just like we treat a broken leg or open wound because we understand something doesnt mean we dont go ahead and treat it
131109 you dont have to ask are you going to kill yourself
131110 dont expect that the physician is going to pick up on it
131111 as a caregiver you can go in with the patient and help articulate the issues you want to talk about so walk in prepared
131112 i always want to pick up the phone and advise brittany spears
131113 the paparazzi is looking to bring down todays stars instead of encouraging them when i was divorcing eddie fisher i couldnt leave the house or take my kids to the park the paparazzi were in my front yard
131114 i have a lot of colorful tales because ive led a colorful life fortunately my fans are getting older with me im the one person that they know in 60 years i have never missed a show
131115 i wasnt sure what carrie was going to say in the tribute and some of what she said surprised me
131116 you dont script carrie you dont script me we just talk from our hearts i thought the tribute was quite wonderful
131117 the director richard brooks didnt want me because he thought i was miss hollywood and couldnt act
131118 bette davis supported me she said pay no attention to him ernest borgnine told me to pull back and give a quiet performance and thats what i did
131119 it was at a happy time in show business when they made movies for pleasure and entertainment
131120 it was just a very productive time in hollywood we were like one big family
131121 i love the warmth of dinner theater and the pulse of a live audience
131122 i keep adding new songs i can keep changing it any way i want to it never stays the same thats the way i try to live my life too i just dont quit
131123 hes not exactly romantic hes thinking about the opera while hes kissing you
131124 i was in this very obscure murder mystery musical whats the matter with helen even though it was a weird picture i loved making it i worked very hard and i think i was very good in it
131125 she was unsinkable she had great courage she was confrontational and she was controversial
131126 try not to be a member of the pack or a groupie if you can be proud of being an individual
131127 he didnt have any more money to spend on legal fees he was much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned
131128 ill tell you we made great progress in the investigation
131129 i was questioned by the feds and i sung like a canary
131130 nothing can bring back a loving wife and mother but legal action is something they are mulling over
131131 the family wants to fully digest what was said at the inquest before making a decision
131132 she had been receiving treatment from the partnership trust just before her untimely death
131133 sarah had been ill for some time before her death and it had been hoped that she would make a full recovery with the assistance from the medical practitioners at the trust
131134 the inquest heard evidence that as a result disciplinary proceedings have already been taken against staff that have been found guilty of gross negligence in the performance of their duties
131135 furthermore the family are aware that in a recent healthcare commission report avon and wiltshire mental health partnership trust received one of the lowest rankings available and was required to improve in 10 areas
131136 one is particularly relevant in case of sarah walsh the trust was criticised for failing sufficiently to involve patients or carers the family express the hope that avon and wiltshire mental health partnership learn hard lessons from these events
131137 to ensure that all lessons from this tragic case are fully learned for the future
131138 regrettably aspects of the care provided to sarah fell below the standards we as a trust expect from our staff
131139 it is quite clear that he was having difficulties in his life and suffering from depression and he had an alcohol and medication problem it is an extremely difficult matter for all those involved for every reason the image of something like this is extremely difficult for someone to carry
131140 i have to take the view it was self inflicted he set fire to himself while in a depressed state
131141 i ran back into the cab and dialled 999 he was still standing up and i could hear him screaming he made a short distance to the car park and fell down
131142 it said there was a man on fire at an address outside the police station i ran out with a first aid kit and a fire blanket and i saw a man on fire on the ground
131143 i ran back to get more blankets and then another firefighter arrived there was no sign of life from the body it was not a windy day so when i looked out the window there was no smoke
131144 we know that environmental cues are significant in many addictions including tobacco and alcohol and contribute to relapses
131145 this study identifies the specific neuronal process involved and helps explain relapse even after rehabilitative therapy or long term abstinence
131146 these potentiated synapses are persistent regardless of what your new behavior is and because the memory is still maintained it could trigger relapse when the conditions are repeated
131147 this is a clear validation that drug addiction is a life long disease three months for a rat could equal several years in a human although drug taking behaviors may be absent the memory makes relapse not only possible but likely
131148 it has been some time since i wrote to investors directly but feel that recent events require some comment
131149 south canterbury finance ltd was incorporated in 1926 and apart from two years in the early nineteen thirties has traded profitably over these 82 years a feat that no other finance company in new zealand has achieved
131150 south canterbury finance ltds business is mainly concentrated on provincial lending
131151 i can think of lots of words to describe whats going on in say china and india as well as what happened previously to countries that adopted the neoliberal global order but honestly do we really yearn to send a billion chinese back to their local economies trying to eke a meager living out of a quarter acre of rice paddy under the iron grip of some local bureaucrat
131152 makes extravagant claims of success for neoliberal policies which on closer analysis are almost entirely dependent on economic growth in china
131153 we should not be on the list we are not going to close long live broadwey
131154 owen chose to give up his birthday party to save the post office hes too young to be a paperboy but goes to the shop for me when im not very well janet and her husband peter are brilliant with him
131155 i suffer from manic depression and some days i cant leave the house but its a safe distance for my children to go on their own
131156 theres no way in this world id allow them to walk to littlemoor or lodmoor hill aged eight and 10 on their own
131157 we have to save broadwey post office because once its gone theres no going back
131158 i can just about walk to the post office and i use it three times a week
131159 its no use them talking about hopping on a bus to the town centre post office if youve got two sticks its very difficult

131161 i can with assurance say that before the closing ceremony on aug 24 all events will be finished

131185 i think this next step training with a club is a big one getting back into a club environment and back into a full routine
131186 it will be nice to get back to training and to get back to grass roots and see how the body feels it will be an important part of assessing where im at
131187 i dont talk to ben about football for his future i talk to him about how hes going and if he needs to talk to me or needs any advice from me he knows im there to talk to him
131188 it will just be good to see this group thrive
131189 weve worked hard at it weve made some great strides it would be good to get that confirmation that we have made progress tomorrow night
131190 but if were sitting here tomorrow night having come second then youll probably suggest that weve made no progress whatsoever
131191 the sheer weight of numbers 1986 its an indicator of what it takes and obviously what weve brought in the past hasnt been enough and were conscious of that but really keen about that as well
131192 you hate missing any games but certainly i was really buoyed by the way the team played last week
131193 in sport you tend to find that those sort of hoodoos or a string of matches either won or lost but they always get broken eventually
131194 i suspect this weekend could be a grind it could be ugly but it will be intense and there will be drama
131195 we monitor and manage our weeks according to our state and i think these guys are probably in better shape now for this challenge than they would have been in week one or week two
131196 these guys will be up for this theyve got a challenge its very clear how significant that challenge is its obvious for all to see but theyre excited
131197 theyre standing at the foot of the hill and theyre ready to climb theyre just waiting for the whistle

131214 he was coming towards me aggressively and i was worried that if i turned to run away he would have attacked me from behind
131215 he accepts full responsibility for what he has done and the implications of proliferating abuse for children
131216 taken substantial steps towards putting his life back on track
131217 rather than a still image where it appears that a child is being abused it is quite that what one views on a video is the most repulsive thing actually being done to a child
131218 robert kilgour was my fathers brother and i was not even a baby when he was killed
131219 i didnt know too much about uncle bobby but thanks to mr lawson i have found out so much about his short life
131220 im extremely grateful i can now come to tranent and look at the war memorial and theres a special plaque with his name on it
131221 im very pleased to see pte kilgours name finally recognised there has been a lot of hard work put into making today so special
131222 it was quite a moving occasion because he was truly a tranent lad and it was lovely to see so many people here to see his name remembered
131223 it means a great deal to the family as they still feel bitter he was slain at the command of general haig
131224 it was a truly appalling battle that robert kilgour died in and im just pleased he has finally been honoured today in this way
131225 last november i received a letter requesting pte kilgours name be put on the towns memorial
131226 i contacted council officials and arranged for his name to be rightfully placed on the memorial today
131227 the council were extremely glad to help in the familys cause

131240 we are firmly convinced and we act on that conviction that with nations as with individuals our interests soundly calculated will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties and history bears witness to
131241 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing

131247 the article takes several not so subtle shots at the prime minister
131248 more likely however is that it simply betrays an appalling lack of good judgment
131249 even the language must remain the same the better to reinforce a stifling orthodoxy
131250 if a prime ministers best hope of staying in office is putting it about that his foreign secretary is not up to the job he really is in trouble
131251 it was clear he was far from well yet he treated us to his usual incisive analyses of the current political situation as well as his sardonic wit during the 30 odd years that i knew him it was his humour that i most savoured
131252 one of the sad aspects of being in the lords where the average age is 68 is that you lose friends and colleagues on a regular basis its something you never quite get used to

131254 i predict that when i come back on this programme in six months time or a year people will be saying wouldnt it be great to have that blair back because we cant stand that gordon brown

131256 the past few years now we havent been getting the results that we wanted
131257 we havent played the best football and we have not selected the best players that this country has
131258 its more about who you play for or who you are rather than your form when the national team is selected
131259 i think that if you play for certain teams then you get selected even though youre not good enough or not on form
131260 its a massive shame its a big embarrassment for the players and the country but things never seem to change
131261 south africa dont select their best players if you play for kaizer chiefs and orlando pirates then you get selected regardless of whether you are good enough or not but hey thats good enough for us right
131262 with the right player selection based on merit on what you are doing at your club where it doesnt matter if youre from cape town or anywhere else in the country and it doesnt matter whether you cant speak zulu or xhosa or any other language where all that counts is that you have a south african passport and are willing to play then yes i think we can become a force

131277 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
131278 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
131279 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
131280 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns

131285 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products

131294 rather the tobacco free initiative is a concrete way we can demonstrate our ongoing commitment to healthy living
131295 this is testimony to the headwinds facing the manufacturing sector
131296 the recent weakness in the sector is consistent with the ber manufacturing business confidence index which declined to a seven and a half year low during the second quarter
131297 this does not bode well for activity in the manufacturing sector over the near term pointing to a further reduction in demand consistent with weaker purchasing manager expectations of business conditions in six months
131298 while the recent oil price decline coupled with some appreciation of the currency will bring some relief rising transport and energy costs continue to threaten a recovery in the sector
131299 the combined effect of weak demand and high cost pressures is severely constraining manufacturing sector activity while the deterioration in the outlook for both domestic and global demand implies at best a slow and protracted recovery of the sector

131326 china has been experiencing similar problems during its industrial revolution that western nations saw during their period of rapid growth pollution environmental damage and resource depletion
131327 domestically we are being constrained in many ways we do not have that many natural resources anymore
131328 we have to rely on the international markets so there is a big security concern there
131329 in order to really drive towards a low carbon economy policy incentives are crucial but it is not always the case
131330 the wind sectors fast growth was mainly a result of domestic policies because the government offered incentives to developments so that private and public sector entrepreneurs would jump on it
131331 but the solar pv sector benefitted mainly from the international market such as demand from the us and eu
131332 even today the policy incentives are still not there yet it still has grown to the level it is now
131333 in terms of total emissions china is already the worlds biggest emitter
131334 thats publicly available information even the government is not denying it anymore
131335 but if you look at emissions on a per capita basis we are not the biggest emitters because we have 1 3bn people
131336 but just looking at numbers does not help tackle global climate change
131337 in china we are concerned about the speed of growth in emissions it is really scary
131338 if they are not able to do it with the technology available to them then is it reasonable to expect china and india to do it
131339 china does not commit itself to a number and then not deliver

131366 im going there to gratify myself by playing and to show off what the music hall has in the way of an organ
131367 we dont print exactly whats being played we announce it we talk in between the songs make little jokes otherwise it gets kind of boring watching the back of somebody

131383 some colleagues are good chums start acting up and the relationship will change
131384 someone previously a peer is technically now a subordinate its important that the deputy acting up doesnt get delusions of grandeur
131385 that can be difficult the relationship has to change somewhat and quite quickly but then you have to rejoin the team afterwards so you have limit any damage to the relationship
131386 you hear about people becoming hitler type figures but that makes it difficult to rejoin the team when the boss returns
131387 the guiding principle is do the job as if its your job for the rest of your life

131390 if hes a controlling boss with a top down style but your style is democratic then think about shifting your style downwards towards your bosss direction
131391 dont impose your own style because its only a brief window to demonstrate your credibility as a leader so you need to consider flexing your own style to meet your team halfway and meet the needs of your own boss
131392 you want that kind of look where people say you look right in that job obama in berlin looked humble but confident he was a little self effacing but looked the part
131393 its a good idea to subtly add what your boss doesnt have you can afford to look like the relaxed alpha because your boss was probably looking like the stressed alpha before the holiday but never look like you are trying desperately to wedge yourself into the job
131394 if youre taking over the bosss office make your own mark its called spraying the territory like putting a small vase on the desk or your own family photograph
131395 dont do everything like repainting the office in your signature colour one small gesture will do

131397 according to the selected literature the relative genetic risk calculated from your genotype for males of european ancestry is 0 90

131476 it is very unlikely that drinking more sugary drinks alone increases the risk of developing diabetes
131477 however consuming them could lead to weight gain and we know that being over weight is a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes other factors include a lack of physical activity and a family history of diabetes

131484 olympic travelers need to be aware of this risk and avoid petting stray animals while in china
131485 if they are bitten they need to seek medical treatment immediately

131489 we know that environmental cues are significant in many addictions including tobacco and alcohol and contribute to relapses
131490 this study identifies the specific neuronal process involved and helps explain relapse even after rehabilitative therapy or long term abstinence
131491 these potentiated synapses are persistent regardless of what your new behavior is and because the memory is still maintained it could trigger relapse when the conditions are repeated
131492 this is a clear validation that drug addiction is a life long disease three months for a rat could equal several years in a human although drug taking behaviors may be absent the memory makes relapse not only possible but likely

131496 the australian psychological society will continue to work with the department to ensure that those people who are placed in detention as a last resort receive humane treatment and support for the time that they are detained
131497 we showed we could block behavior in mice that resembles this increased euphoria even after the animals had been given a lot of alcohol
131498 thats what you want in a treatment because we dont get to people until after they become addicted to alcohol

131500 within our health care system health plans often serve to identify and address emerging issues of patient safety and cost and they set out to devise solutions to these problems
131501 the gao report is a good illustration that the private sector is serving as an early warning system on critical quality safety and cost issues in the u s health care system
131502 we welcome the findings of the inquiry this is yet more evidence that in too many cases people with learning disabilities dont get the health services they need
131503 we know that people with learning disabilities are more likely to suffer from serious health problems yet they often lack access to healthcare services
131504 we must make sure that the findings of the inquiry engender real change
131505 strategic health authorities and monitor should check up on trusts and take an active role in making sure that the nhs is meeting the health needs of people with learning disabilities

131519 this survey shows the high regard that many patients have for the services at their gp surgeries that is really good news not least because the nhs sees the vast majority of its patients in gps surgeries and health centres rather than in hospitals
131520 however people clearly do want to be able to see a gp more easily and at more convenient times
131521 access to nhs dental care is also a continuing concern and this survey shows where people are most worried about this around the country
131522 publication of this survey with comparative information will help trusts and gps to address patients concerns in assessing the performance of primary care trusts we at the commission will take account of patients views and ask questions about the issues raised we recognise the national concerns about dental care and we will be highlighting gaps where they occur
131523 our new study shows that subjects with a mother with alzheimers show similarities with alzheimers patients
131524 they have metabolic reductions in the brain regions that are typically affected by ad which worsen over time
131525 although many of us have these changes in our genetic material they are about 15 percent more frequent in people with schizophrenia
131526 we also discovered two large areas of chromosomal deletions that confer a great deal of risk for schizophrenia and confirm involvement of a third previously reported area
131527 by implicating two previously unknown sites this study triples the number of genomic areas definitely linked to schizophrenia
131528 it also confirms in a large sample that unraveling the secrets of rare structural genetic variation may hold promise for improved diagnosis treatment and prevention of such neuro developmental disorders
131529 this tells us that variations in both of these areas are very potent risk factors for schizophrenia
131530 the idea was to measure which levels of weight support and speeds give us the best combination of aerobic workout while reducing the impact on joints
131531 we showed that a person can run faster in the g trainer at a lower weight and still get substantial aerobic benefits while maintaining good neuromuscular coordination
131532 if you can decrease the intensity of these peak forces during running then you probably will decrease the risk of injury to the runner
131533 this is an important milestone for lani we congratulate our partner daiichi sankyo for a timely completion of phase ii
131534 lots more work needs to be done but what these discoveries will do is help us start to classify the sub types of the illness so that individualised targeted medicine is possible in the future
131535 at the moment a broad range of anti psychotic drugs are used to treat schizophrenia but because people respond to drugs in different ways treatments are largely trial and error and often involve unpleasant side effects
131536 it is well recognized that schizophrenia has a variety of causes and several different factors can trigger episodes but mutations deletions and other variation in genes are probably the largest contributors
131537 these are exciting new findings because the chromosomal abnormalities that have been described will be signposts to other genes involved in illness and hopefully lead on to new drug discoveries and novel treatment approaches this is good news for all the patients and their families throughout scotland who have given tremendous support to these genetic studies over several years
131538 the field of schizophrenia genetics has been quite controversial for the last 20 years and some people would argue that no genes have really been found
131539 but that era has now effectively drawn to a close because it is very difficult to dispute these new findings these discoveries consolidate the field and make psychiatric genetics after many false starts one of the most exciting areas in the biological sciences
131540 much more work will need to be done before these discoveries impact on clinical practice diagnosis and treatment but the field is moving very rapidly moreover the uk and especially scotland is well placed to continue to play a leading role in continuing to reveal the complex genetics behind psychiatric disorders
131541 we are pleased that the andes trial met the primary endpoint and showed a dose response in reducing a1c based on the results of this successful trial atherogenics intends to rapidly move forward with development of agi 1067
131542 we believe that agi 1067 through its unique mechanism of action could become the first diabetes treatment with demonstrated cardiovascular safety and with the potential to reduce cardiovascular hard events including cardiovascular death heart attack and stroke as reported from the 6 144 patient phase 3 arise trial which concluded in 2007
131543 we are excited about the advances we have made to date with the patient identification tool for agi 1067
131544 we plan to incorporate this tool into the next agi 1067 phase 3 trial
131545 we kind of brushed it under the carpet we try to ignore it really to try to get on with our life and hopefully she will stop doing it
131546 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
131547 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
131548 addiction shouldnt be an unsolvable problem if methadone is ever used as an anti cancer therapy

131551 unfortunately fuji gave in to the megapixel race on the finepix f100fd which pretty much did away with the high sensitivity advantage that made earlier models such a success the f100fd performs slightly better than other compact cameras up to a point iso 800 but above that images become a noisy mess the camera is marred by other flaws as well including a slow lens difficult to access menu system and poor battery life the finepix f100fd certainly isnt a bad just an average one which is a disappointment considering its heritage
131552 the fujifilm finepix z20fd is small and fun and offers good capability for its tiny size the 10 megapixel ccd picks up a lot of fine detail and both color and exposure performance are generally good noise handling isnt great at the highest sensitivity settings but results are fine at the normal isos blurring in the corners of the frame will definitely detract from compositions with a lot of fine detail in these areas but for average day to day snapshots the z20fds performance should be just fine

131701 the beauty of edf from the governments perspective was that it had both the expertise and the balance sheet to begin work straight away

131716 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
131717 i feel quite glad the deals fallen through in a way because theres been a huge concentration of electricity generation in the hands on one supplier over a quarter of the market in one supplier that would have been very bad
131718 i cant think of any short term implications over the next couple of years from this the market remains unchanged because no deal is happening
131719 but in the long run it is very serious the government does have to get on with creating the climate in which these new nuclear power stations are built
131720 it would have been very convenient because edf have the resources they have the access to the technology and british energy have the sites
131721 the timing suggests to me that there might still be life in it because clearly its about terms rather than about principles so maybe they can go back and bring it together
131722 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight i think it would have been a good fit
131723 edf are as people know the worlds largest nuclear operator i think it would have been a very sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
131724 but the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular deal
131725 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged but i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations
131726 so its disappointing but its certainly something that we need to focus on as we make sure that britain develops the new nuclear power plants that it needs
131727 i hope that they can i do remain convinced this is the right deal but its got to be acceptable to the shareholders and those are the discussions that are going on today

131939 he recibido garant as incondicionales del presidente del coi jacques rogge y del presidente de la comisi n de coordinaci n hein verbruggen de que nosotros no hemos cambiado de postura
131940 hemos formado un equipo en el coi para que trabaje con el bocog para comenzar a abrir las web que nosotros creemos que son absolutamente necesarias para cumplir con la informaci n no censurada de los juegos
131941 estamos en el proceso de desbloquear las web que previamente hab an sido bloqueadas
131942 habr p ginas bloqueadas relacionadas con pornograf a o que en opini n del gobierno son subversivas o contrarias al inter s nacional y eso es normal en la mayor a de los pa ses del mundo
131943 creo que si gano ma ana por hoy viernes ser n mero 1 si no gano ma ana ser el n mero uno en dos semanas as que no importa si caigo en la primera ronda de los juegos ol mpicos y roger gana no el partido de ma ana ser muy importante
131944 s que estoy en una buena posici n y no s lo porque roger tenga que ganar todo a partir de aqu los juegos ol mpicos y el abierto de estados unidos

131950 the recent poll showing that 71 of irish people are opposed to a second referendum on the lisbon treaty has not had much impact in european capitals since the wording of the question indicated that the vote would be on the same text there is no question of that either the irish will be asked to adopt the lisbon treaty with ad hoc declarations responding to their concerns like in 2002 for nice or they will be asked if they want to continue to be part of a union that is governed by the lisbon treaty this second possibility would clarify things either you stay or you go but you do not block europe as a whole
131951 im willing and ready to admit that im in pain every day its pretty terrible to be honest with you

132010 skin cells from an elderly patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als have been reprogrammed to generate motor neurons the type of nerve cells that die as the disease progresses it is the first time that an induced pluripotent stem ips cell line has been created from a patient with a genetic illness j t dimos et al science doi 10 1126 science 1158799 2008 like embryonic stem cells ips cells have the potential to develop into almost any of the bodys cell types and offer new disease insights the researchers led by kevin eggan of the harvard stem cell institute in cambridge massachusetts and christopher henderson of columbia universitys center for motor neuron biology and disease in new york made the ips cells using viral vectors to introduce four genes into skin cells taken from two elderly patients with a mild form of als also known as lou gehrigs disease
132011 after nearly a decade of setbacks and false starts stem cell science finally seems to be hitting its stride just a year after japanese scientists first reported that they had generated stem cells by reprogramming adult skin cells without using embryos american researchers have managed to use that groundbreaking technique to achieve another scientific milestone they created the first nerve cells from reprogrammed stem cells an important demonstration of the potential power of stem cell based treatments to cure disease
132012 scientists turn skin cells into motor neurons in als patients
132013 scientists have turned skin cells from patients with lou gehrigs disease into motor neurons that are genetically identical to the patients own neurons an unlimited number of these neurons can now be created and studied in the laboratory a capability which should result in a better understanding of the disease and one day lead to new treatments or even the production of healthy cells that can replace the diseased ones
132014 scientists have succeeded in transforming skin cells from two sisters with motor neurone disease into the same kind of nerve cells being destroyed by their illness raising the possibility that the new cells can be transplanted back into them to offset the degenerative condition
132015 scientists have created the first personalized stem cells for patients with a genetic disease by rewinding their skin cells to an embryonic state according to a study published today in the online edition of science the researchers then converted some of those stem cells into the two kinds of brain cells that cause their crippling disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis commonly known as lou gehrigs disease
132016 researchers are one step closer to reprogramming skin cells into tailor made healthy replacements for diseased cells applying the technique first developed by james thomson of the university of wisconsin madison and shinya yamanaka of kyoto university scientists at harvard and columbia universities reported online today in the journal science that they had turned skin cells from two elderly patients with the neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als into motor neurons the nerve cells that become damaged in als this is the first time that scientists have coaxed embryonic like cells from adult patients suffering from a genetic based disease then induced the cells to form the specific cell types that would be needed to study and treat the disease
132017 using a new technique to reprogram cells scientists are growing neurons from people with lou gehrigs disease a possible first step in understanding how the deadly illness develops
132018 what we now have in the culture dish is cells that have the same genetic makeup as the als patient and they are the same cells that are affected by the disease said dr chris henderson co director of the center for motor neuron biology and disease at columbia university that means that for the first time scientists hope to be able to observe the development of the disease in the cells and from that possibly begin studies of treatments
132019 for the first time scientists have proven that embryonic like stem cells that are specific to both a person and to a disease can be manufactured using adult human cells researchers from harvard and columbia universities used skin cells from two patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als also known as lou gehrigs disease to create stem cells and then reprogrammed them to morph into replacement motor neurons
132020 ordinary skin cells taken from patients with a fatal and incurable nerve disease have been transformed into nerve cells in a first step toward treating them u s researchers reported on thursday they transformed the cells from two patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or lou gehrigs disease into motor neurons the cells that waste away and die in als there is no immediate medical use for the cells taken from two sisters aged 82 and 89 the researchers reported in the journal science
132021 andrei is ready to move to tottenham now it just depends on zenit
132022 arshavin changed his decision about joining spurs due to excellent interest from spurs
132023 they are the one team that fully agreed his contract demands and ready to pay almost the full price that zenit wants
132024 juande ramos called andrei and described his vision of football and his vision of andreis future in the team
132025 ramos said that arshavin will be a key player of his team and he is highly interested in this deal
132026 spurs had the money for andrei all the time and their interest isnt new but zenit doesnt want to say that they have official offer from tottenham but they have it
132027 i dont think the deal can be delayed until the super cup against manchester united because im unsure that todays arshavin can be useful for zenit
132028 i hope that zenit will collect themselves i know the high level of professionalism of zenits new president alexander dukov and his great personality
132029 we have certain contacts with tottenham but when they will conclude i still do not know
132030 kaspars knows we intend to play good attractive football and he wants to be a part of it

132033 mereka akan memberikan penjelasan tapi kami menyesalkan ini bisa terjadi
132034 tadinya mereka maybank sudah mendapatkan izin dari regulator mereka terus sekarang mendadak nggak dikasih izin tentu yang sangat dirugikan investor indonesia yang tadinya sudah ambil posisi
132035 setelah keputusan bi keluar mereka membatalkan alasannya karena aturan bapepam yang baru saya rasa itu tidak beralasan kalau menyalahkan aturan bapepam karena aturan baru itu hanya tambahan harus mengeluarkan sahamnya 20 tapi itu kan kita kasih waktu sampai 2 tahun
132036 jadi bukan tidak mungkin hal itu bisa terjadi ini artinya masalah pesimis atau optimis nah kalau pertimbangan pesimisme itu kemudian membuat mereka akan rugi itu kan pertimbangan spekulasi nah perhitungan spekulatif itu tidak boleh menjadi dasar keputusan tersebut yang sangat merugikan investor indonesia

132084 vdi staat nog in de kinderschoenen en is zeker nog in ontwikkeling sinds kort zijn twee grote namen in de virtualisatiewereld vmware en citrix ingestapt in vdi met deze toetreding zal er in ieder geval een versnelling komen in de r evolutie van het product vdi de virtualisatie van het werkstation zou nog een stap verder kunnen door het te verplaatsen naar de hardware van het werkstation zelf hiermee bedoel ik de virtualisatie van de lokale hardware met een synchronisatie naar het datacenter indien de mogelijkheid zich voordoet hiermee komt er ook een mogelijkheid voor laptops om gebruik te maken van de voordelen van vdi er is nog een lange weg te gaan maar ik ben ervan overtuigd dat met vdi een eerste stap is gezet naar een flexibele en dynamische werkstationinfrastructuur
132085 virtualisatie op de desktop is een volgende stap in de virtualisatiemarkt de vraag is of iedereen hier al aan toe is op dit moment is iedereen zich aan het richten op de virtualisatie van de servers enerzijds omdat de servers steeds krachtiger worden anderzijds vanwege milieuredenen zal de vdi techniek echt doordringen tot de desktop voorwaarde is denk ik dat de applicatie geschikt is om hiermee om te gaan de huidige technieken citrix en rdp hebben voor een aantal applicaties beperkingen waardoor ze eigenlijk niet gebruikt worden indien deze beperkingen uit de weg worden genomen is er zeker een kans van slagen verschillende bedrijven zijn inmiddels betrokken bij de ontwikkeling van vdi vooral voor het versnellen en beperken van het verkeer
132086 ik denk dat er twee verschillende technologie n op een hoop worden gegooid aan de ene kant de nieuwe incarnatie van de domme terminal aan de andere kant het gebruik van virtualisatie voor de dekstop het ene is prima zonder het andere te gebruiken een terminal in combinatie met een broker en windows server levert minder problemen op dan de hier beschreven oplossing wat ook niet vergeten moet worden is dat met vdi de desktop effects en film een probleem vormen een terminal zonder geavanceerde grafische weergave doet gemiddeld 100 kb per seconde piekbelastingen boven de 1 mb per seconde zijn normaal printen maar bijvoorbeeld ook usb sticks vormen een uitdaging printopdrachten van 100 mb zijn niet ongewoon maar wel lastig als je in een pand zit dat bijvoorbeeld met een sdsl verbinding aan het centrale netwerk hangt ik denk wel dat deze technologie de toekomst heeft maar hij is zeker nog niet uitontwikkeld
132087 hoewel het steeds meer komt is vdi nog niet doorgebroken hoewel hiermee een goede stap gezet kan worden in de richting van working anywhere zie ik bedrijven het niet snel doen omdat het een grote investering is vdi biedt een ge soleerd systeem waarbij je er dus voor zou kunnen kiezen om de eindgebruiker alles op zijn eigen desktop te laten instaleren zonder dat anderen er last van hebben de vraag is dan of het niet een andere vorm van beheer vereist want ten opzichte van het reguliere beheer geeft het een grotere vorm van centralisatie van systemen steeds meer en meer zal er remote gewerkt worden en steeds meer wordt de systeembeheerder verwijderd van het persoonlijke contact met de klant al met al ben ik een beetje in dubio vdi is in potentie een goed product of het slaagt ligt aan de manier waarop het toegepast gaat worden
132088 vdi is meer dan een hype ondanks dat het nog niet echt is doorgebroken de grote bedrijven als microsoft vmware en citrix leveren goede oplossingen en een speler als 2x levert een goede prijsbewuste oplossing die zeker de moeite waard is voor klanten levert het enerzijds een besparing op maar veel belangrijker het levert een continu beschikbare client op de client is bijna monkeyproof voor gebruikers levert het een heel flexibele omgeving op mits goed ge mplementeerd juist in de implementatiefase gaat het vaak mis onjuist ge mplementeerd wordt het al snel een bottleneck in je omgeving ik heb zelf de vdi training van vmware gehad en was erg verbaasd wat er allemaal nog bij komt kijken om het goed te doen voor de klant is het een goed concept waar zeker geld mee te besparen is maar zorg voor een goede implementatiedienstverlener
132089 vdi is zeker een groeimarkt voor komende tijd ik zie dat de interesse vanuit de markt er zeker is maar dat er te veel naar de kostenbesparende aspecten gekeken wordt ik denk dat dit een verkeerd uitgangspunt is om te kijken naar vdi en het zal zeker ook niet de doorslag geven om vdi te implementeren het is meer een oplossing die gaat samenwerken met de traditionele omgevingen en dus naast de bestaande infrastructuur zijn sterke punten zijn de voordelen van centraal beheer en het snel uitrollen van nieuwe werkplekken ik denk dat vdi een product is dat we de komende tijd veel gaan tegenkomen
132090 op dit moment is vdi als concept meer een tussenoplossing voor veel bedrijven zal het complementair zijn aan hun server based computing omgeving en niet per se concurrerend waar de meeste ict managers maar zeker ook de business managers van dromen is een homogene omgeving die off en online kan werken en daarmee overal beschikbaar is of beschikbaar gemaakt kan worden perfecte uniforme ontsluiting tot alle applicaties die de eindgebruiker nodig heeft tot die tijd moeten we het doen met de beschikbare infrastructuurproducten en die zijn zeker niet slecht er ontbreekt echter hier en daar nog wel voldoende integratie om acceptatie door het bedrijfsleven vanzelfsprekend te maken een implementatie van een virtuele desktop waarbij al deze producten ingezet worden moet ik echter nog tegenkomen kostentechnisch gezien is dat namelijk een slechte oplossing
132091 vdi wordt steeds vaker genoemd als oplossing en komt steeds vaker op de roadmap te staan de voordelen van vdi zijn onder andere security beter in staat compliant te zijn en een betere manageability ook zaken als een thuiswerkplek zijn makkelijker te realiseren en de migratie naar vdi is relatief eenvoudig om de kostenbesparingen te halen die vaak worden genoemd zijn er diverse randvoorwaarden het betekent dat de infrastructuur aan de juiste eisen moet voldoen qua bandbreedte storage en tooling het betekent dat de kwaliteit van beheer op een hoog niveau moet staan het vraagt om meer kennis dan standaardbeheer in sommige gevallen is een groot voorbereidend traject nodig voordat er kan worden begonnen met implementatie een goede architectuur is hierbij nodig de toekomst van vdi ziet er heel goed uit en zal binnenkort ook niet meer weg te denken zijn
132092 vdi is mijns inziens zeker geen hype sterker nog ik denk dat het op dit moment de enige manier is om de uitdagingen die alle bedrijven hebben op het gebied van beheer stroomverbruik ruimtegebrek in het datacenter koelingsproblemen etc op een effectieve manier te lijf te gaan belangrijk bij elke vdi oplossing is dat deze zo min mogelijk moet ingrijpen op de bestaande infrastructuur applicatie onafhankelijk moet zijn en naadloos met bestaande applicaties moet kunnen integreren het artikel refereert aan oplossingen van citrix en vmware op ons kantoor gebruiken wij al zon acht jaar de sunray als desktop en onze vdi oplossing wordt regelmatig ge mplementeerd bij klanten vdi heeft dus zeker een toekomst

132116 maar wordt overgemaakt aan instituten en organisaties die zelf in het bestuur zitten

132119 if its not saturday but next week well not make a big fuss about it what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the very coming days
132120 we are continuing our double approach of dialogue and pressure if dialogue does not work we could continue with additional pressure at the u n or eu level
132121 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
132122 market players actively closed their dollar and other currency positions on signs that economic conditions worldwide are deteriorating
132123 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the u s
132124 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that
132125 prices will likely correct over the next six months to the 100 to 110 range
132126 there arent enough fundamental factors right now pushing prices higher
132127 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
132128 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
132129 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
132130 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
132131 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
132132 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
132133 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
132134 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
132135 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
132136 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
132137 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
132138 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
132139 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
132140 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
132141 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
132142 im willing and ready to admit that im in pain every day its pretty terrible to be honest with you
132143 but i am here i am speaking with you im very fortunate and there are some that arent as fortunate as i and others that had no fortune that day
132144 its the type of thing we spend our careers trying to make sure does not occur
132145 that is not something you would want to leave to somebody else to have to pick up
132146 the bridge did collapse while i was the state bridge engineer so i feel i need to deal with it
132147 daily we spend time dealing with the aftermath of i 35w im not complaining
132148 im not going to tell you that weve never seen a political investigation here before
132149 but this one did have a good deal of political interest and outcry why this was a very highly visible event of incredible magnitude bridges dont fall in the united rare that they do very rare
132150 but we do not engage in politics we are not influenced by politics
132151 we are not protecting the governors butt any longer this has got to be done
132152 you can only fiddle with this stuff so long people dont like increases in taxes i dont but i dont know how else to pay for that
132153 he is a player that schuster and the coaching staff like a lot and the deal is close we are waiting to reach a definitive agreement with hamburg but it shouldnt be difficult
132154 we give the planet the benefit of the doubt and support action on climate change
132155 we received a third party allegation at 12 09am on wednesday that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street
132156 officers established the incident had occurred at around 10 20pm on tuesday
132157 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
132158 he was not arrested and did not attend a police station inquiries continue
132159 you gotta do something you cant just oil up like a canolad snapper and expect nothing but being catered to like amy winehouse minus the crack pipe

132162 it helps them with time in terms of seeing when they were babies and growing and getting bigger they think its just hilarious to see some of the things they did as babies
132163 its not even the prizes so much its the hunt
132164 if i can get 10 minutes to hide things then that will occupy them for a long time
132165 furthermore softening labor market conditions do not portend acceleration in wage growth any time soon
132166 its something that weve been waiting quite a while for
132167 we expected to find water in this landing site thats why we came here
132168 but were very pleased to see that we landed right on top of water ice this is a wonderful thing for us because the water could have been all around us and not within reach of our robot arm
132169 so were moving toward understanding whether or not there are places on mars that could have been or might still be habitable
132170 but gneo coming in with the bases loaded and them not scoring that was huge
132171 we had two games when we came back in the seventh inning to win earlier this week so our pitching was shot
132172 we were told that the reason they would go to eminent domain is because then everybody would come out with a fair amount of money and everybody would benefit that it was not being done other than to establish value and we did that and the judge did that
132173 i certainly would not have been astounded if the decision had been closer to our figure if he had decided to appeal
132174 we have three displays in the store that weve had to restock daily
132175 our staff has started reading them in the past month or two
132176 were really excited and hope people come to the party on friday night
132177 the turtle island quartet has the chops the guts the soul the spirit and the taste to take on the musical legacy of john coltrane
132178 there is a lot of anger and discontent among shareholders it will be lively friday
132179 the meeting will be an opportunity for us to speak up and make our voices heard if youre in the bay area i encourage you to come out hopefully well have a lively set of questions posed to the yahoo board in a true direct fashion
132180 i dont think theyll be able to execute on all of them
132181 its a cool bold visionary project but it will be hard to do
132182 im willing and ready to admit that im in pain every day its pretty terrible to be honest with you
132183 but i am here i am speaking with you im very fortunate and there are some that arent as fortunate as i and others that had no fortune that day

132194 its an animal study and its a relatively small sample
132195 its very interesting but putting genetic type research like this into context is quite difficult at the early stage it can offer up great potential but when you then go to humans and when you then go to trained humans the potential may not be there
132196 its not so much convincing people who have walked away from us
132197 its engaging people who dont think of ford as a car brand
132198 given where we were and where we needed to get to i felt someone from outside would break some molds
132199 ford has to change a lot for a maverick approach like farleys to take hold
132200 saving ford has to appeal to ones ego rather than playing it relatively safe at toyota
132201 but helping toyota rack up another 12 billion in profits isnt much of a legacy
132202 rather we are blessed with having an incredibly supportive record label in wichita and they are as excited about such freedom frivolities and spontaneity in releases as we are

132208 we have always maintained since the curtain closed in athens that we wanted to achieve a top five finish in the overall medal tally in beijing
132209 the belief that natural talent would rise but the rest of the world got more professional got commercial and the gdr german democratic republic had a lot of drugs australia just couldnt keep up
132210 was a very important reason for the improvement in australian performances in the 1980s 1990s and 2000s
132211 people realised that australian athletes unless they had better coaching better training better travel arrangements just couldnt compete and people actually voted to spend the money on elite athletes
132212 youve got to have the money first of all to invest in sport
132213 theyre going to have to find some more money if they want us to be there in the top five
132214 one key reason is a long tradition of olympic success

132225 we started out in paris where collaborator jon brion inspired us to create first and think later
132226 we took the night train to berlin where everything came together in an avalanche of experimentation that took us all by surprise where we made a pact with producer stuart price to ignore the rules of good taste where we were hypnotised by marlene dietrich and spent many a long night throwing ideas around in the crumbling cabaret esque glamour of our favourite bar
132227 weve hidden ourselves away in the depths of the english countryside recorded a new track in london at the last possible moment and now were in los angeles tying up the loose ends

132230 he was just so excited to be going on the trip i shook his hand and said have a good time and take care you dont think those words are going to haunt you
132231 he was a lovely kid a happy go lucky kid he was well respected and he had everything in front of him
132232 they left a club they were walking down the road and four guys pulled up in a car they were big guys and presented themselves as police
132233 they were told to get up against the wall cameron said this isnt good they are not police and when they went to go they started bashing them
132234 he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time
132235 put it this way our parents brought us up very well he had been with all my cousins he loved it so much he thought about not leaving malta to go to greece he wanted to stay there and talked about how much he liked it
132236 they cried when they were leaving one of the cousins said to him i dont want you to go

132322 surface potentials and layer charge distributions in few layer graphene films
132323 looking at a spectrum you cant tell if its the result of a small number of molecules in hot spots or a large number of molecules in cold spots
132324 two materials could have the same average spectrum but behave quite differently
132325 if a molecule is in a very hot spot on the substrate where the electric field enhancement is really big it takes only a weak pulse to kill it
132326 if the molecule is in a very cold spot then it takes a really big laser pulse to kill it
132327 we found the hottest spots comprised just 63 molecules per million but contributed 24 percent of the overall raman intensity
132328 we also found the coldest spots contained 61 percent of the molecules but contributed only 4 percent of the overall intensity
132329 now when evaluating a new surface enhanced raman material instead of knowing just the average intensity we know the highest the lowest and everything in between
132330 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease
132331 theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
132332 if a patient is scheduled for a physical he or she may tune up by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results causing doctors to miss the patients usual pattern of high blood sugar
132333 could greatly enhance how well were able to identify people with diabetes
132334 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation into the origins of life and planets
132335 the abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated
132336 and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe so when you think about it all of the elements in our bodies originally formed from nuclear reactions in the centers of stars long ago
132337 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point towards our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
132338 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star but here the physics become much more complicated and even more computational resources are needed
132339 we know that environmental cues are significant in many addictions including tobacco and alcohol and contribute to relapses
132340 this study identifies the specific neuronal process involved and helps explain relapse even after rehabilitative therapy or long term abstinence
132341 these potentiated synapses are persistent regardless of what your new behavior is and because the memory is still maintained it could trigger relapse when the conditions are repeated
132342 this is a clear validation that drug addiction is a life long disease three months for a rat could equal several years in a human although drug taking behaviors may be absent the memory makes relapse not only possible but likely
132343 when one of these rare genetic variations is present in a person the result is a moderate to large increase in disease risk in a study lead by dr michael odonovan from cardiff university we also found other relatively frequent variations that slightly increase a persons risk our results could make a significant contribution to the further research concerning the causes of schizophrenia as well as the development of diagnostic tests and possibly treatment
132344 persons affected with the illness however may exhibit changes in thought and behavior
132345 hallucinations or delusions are only a few of the potential symptoms of this severe mental illness
132346 there are presumably several genetic factors working together each of which only has a very small effect on disease risk or which occur very rarely and have a moderate to strong effect
132347 for this reason the field of schizophrenia genetics should be concerned with identifying these so called risk genes we have certainly made an important leap in the search for genetic factors yet there is not a single schizophrenia gene but rather only genetic variations that can increase or decrease ones susceptibility to the illness
132348 altogether a great number of institutes took part in both studies
132349 we would never have been able to achieve the enormous sample size otherwise and were therefore able to find associations between the genetic variations and the illness without regional or national differences what is also particularly interesting here is that there are clearly different mechanisms that come into play for example we have found rare genetic variations that have a major influence but we have also found frequent genetic variations that have only a minor effect on the disease risk
132350 wants to pursue policies that focus on peoples daily lives
132351 this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
132352 even some ldp members have been saying that its better to hold snap elections as early as possible because they dont think they can win elections with fukuda in the prime ministers post
132353 the secretary general operates the entire party its an attractive position for mr aso
132354 the flip side of that is he cannot turn down the offer to take the position
132355 building on the first half performance the previously anticipated growth outlook for 2008 as a whole is expected to benefit further from the current high demand for armoured wheeled vehicles to meet operational requirements
132356 continues to benefit from operational requirements in iraq and afghanistan especially in the wheeled vehicle market
132357 lack of time prevented us from being able to address the outstanding concerns of one delegation
132358 no position has been taken by the security council on the question of whether to take any action in the light of the moreno ocampo proposal to indict president beshir
132359 the united states abstained in the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president beshir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
132360 i want to give high marks to the british delegation
132361 they discussed in good faith with everybody they were very cooperative they tried to accommodate the concerns of major parties
132362 to pledge and contribute the helicopter aerial reconnaissance ground transport engineering and logistical units and other force enablers required
132363 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
132364 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues
132365 it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
132366 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
132367 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations
132368 we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
132369 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 percent on the same period last year
132370 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
132371 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
132372 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
132373 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
132374 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
132375 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardising the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods

132377 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter
132378 the price level of pre owned cars in the usa and hence the level of revenues that can be generated on vehicles returned at the end of leases remained under further pressure
132379 this situation has made it necessary for the bmw group to increase its risk provision

132385 we have seen the reports in western media for lenovo as an olympic sponsor this will not have any effect on us
132386 weve seen significant improvement in the past three or four years in recognition of lenovos brand abroad
132387 of course this is closely related to our acquisition of ibms global pc business as well as our global marketing activities such as the olympic sponsorship i hope that with this global marketing campaign during the olympics we will make more progress in this
132388 we are absolutely delighted with this sponsorship deal because it gets scottish league teams back on the television it is an important step in the right direction as we wanted to raise the profile of the challenge cup and get more people to come along and support it by rescheduling most of the rounds to saturdays or sundays on international weekends we are giving the competition its own unique place in the calendar
132389 our position is that the ioc has always encouraged the beijing 2008 organisers to provide media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games including access to the internet
132390 in light of internet access problems which were experienced this week by media in the olympic games main press centre in beijing the ioc namely chairman of the beijing 2008 ioc coordination commission hein verbruggen and olympic games executive director gilbert felli held meetings and discussions today with games organisers bocog and chinese authorities
132391 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them
132392 richards experience encompasses the full range of sports rights exploitation tv and new media operations and sports sponsorship he has proven leadership skills and understands the importance of managing the full range of stakeholder interests

132394 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
132395 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
132396 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
132397 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
132398 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
132399 the scientific community is really going to run with this
132400 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
132401 to the beijing olympic games the biggest threat comes from the east turkistan terrorist organization
132402 the second biggest threat to the olympic games comes from the separatist forces including the tibetan independent activists these forces are trying all means to sabotage the beijing olympic games
132403 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
132404 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
132405 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
132406 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
132407 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
132408 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
132409 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
132410 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
132411 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
132412 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
132413 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
132414 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
132415 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
132416 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
132417 there is a community of people who arent watching cnn or reading the huffington post
132418 ich glaube es kann so gro werden wie world of warcraft werden wir die richigen entscheidungen treffen ich glaube nicht dass wir mit dem n chsten mmo garantiert den gleichen erfolg erzielen nur weil wir world of warcraft gemacht haben
132419 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the us
132420 growth and oil demand is slowing in the us europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that
132421 prices will likely correct over the next six months to the 100 to 110 range
132422 there arent enough fundamental factors right now pushing prices higher
132423 when did you get the idea that you would like to make money online and can you describe to me how you have come to be a blogger rather than a traditional web site creator
132424 i did not originally set out to make money from my website i began the blog on a free blogspot as a hobby and outlet to say what was on my mind at first i wrote about anything and everything while peppering in a few posts on lawns and landscapes my first post was on 6 11 07 and was just me spewing about lawn chemicals and other gripes that i had related to common misunderstandings in our industry
132425 i migrated to a self hosted wordpress blog in sept 07 because i wanted more functionality and because i wanted to earn respect in my niche i have since learned to tone it down and use my blog as a platform to educate rather than bash peoples mistakes i started to see my blog as a way to generate revenue in about march 2008 when i noticed people were actually finding the blog through google and were staying and reading and sending me emails with questions
132426 at that point i instituted adsense thinking id use it to pay for hosting i also began reading various blends of make money online blogs such as gcdc as my knowledge of seo grew and pageviews increased my revenue grew right along with them so far this year ive made enough to pay for upgraded hosting for the next year and also take my wife on a nice trip to cancun my goal now is to continue to learn to convert my traffic into money to see if i can eventually make enough to expand into video posting and eventually internet tv like an hgtv online kinda thing
132427 of all the different topics that you could have chosen to write about as a blogger why did you choose the topic of lawns and landscaping did you know at that time when you launched the blog that your content could be monetized or at the time did you have other intentions in mind
132428 i truly love gardening landscaping and grass im the nut who is always out in his lawn or landscape looking over everything and making sure it is perfect if my lawn is not striped like a baseball field i aint happy im not totally creepy though i dont go so far as to talk to my plants but i do drink a lot of beer with them i figured if i was going to start a blog i should enjoy the topic or it wouldnt last long i had no idea that you could make money from writing about lawns and lawn tips i just started the blog as a hobby i also enjoy writing and got an ego trip when strangers would leave comments or send me email
132429 reflecting back from the day you started your blog all the way to current what are three things that you would recommend to others would who would like to create a blog and make a passive income from it i dont mean get rich but having a little extra money to cover a bill or two each month would be nice
132430 if you are set on a niche topic start it on your own hosted wordpress i tell friends of mine to get a free blog from wordpress com and write unimportant stuff about whatever just to get a feel for blogging and how the wysiwyg works etc but i tell them to put their true niche blog on their own hosting from the beginning
132431 a second thing i would suggest would be to establish strict guidelines for your niche and stay within them you dont want to confuse readers with a bunch of topics that dont relate to the keywords they are searching for i still have a few old posts on my blog that i just cant part with yet but need to because they are not a part of my niche and only serve as a distraction or exit point
132432 the third piece of advice i would offer would be to care about your content more than making money if you do that the money will soon follow good content sells i am actually too strict on this and have lost missed out on money because i did not want to put adsense inside of my post content for fear it would stunt the readership garry i recently took the advice you left for me in your recent comment and made my adsense units larger in the posts and my ctr has tripled while average page views and time on page stayed static
132433 did your job as a public affairs specialist in the u s air force have any influence on allowing you build and maintain a successful niche blog what can other people who dont have experience in journalism and writing do to improve their writing skills so that they too can produce content that is entertaining informative and or useful for others
132434 stephen levitt and stephen dubner they take a super dry topic and dumb it down to my level and keep me glued in that is talent
132435 if you were to create a second blog what are things that you would do differently compared to some things that you may have learned the hard way on your lawn care and landscaping blog
132436 i have lost 50 pounds in the last 12 months i am 35 yrs old and started working out again i see lots of weight loss type blogs but the people behind them mostly complain about their struggles and failures id like to start one and speak pointedly to people that it can be done things i will do differently i will pay for a custom template for the new blog because i can i will write 20 posts before launching and time them to publish every 3 days or so i will get more involved with stumbleupon and digg my current niche is not really suited for those imo i will secure advertisers from my contacts in the real world prior to launch i now know what i can do and am able to forecast and set expectations for results that they will see and charge accordingly i would love to have monthly predictable advertising revenue from clients that i know face to face
132437 in 1997 in eastern parts of nepal there were about 67 nests
132438 and in four or five years in 2001 there was zero
132439 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
132440 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
132441 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
132442 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
132443 when she made it clear she didnt want to have anything to do with him he became enraged
132444 after they made a deal they were following her to another motel room when they were approached by three males from behind and forced into a room at gunpoint

132446 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
132447 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
132448 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
132449 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
132450 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
132451 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
132452 you have value on the ground more than you spent
132453 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
132454 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
132455 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
132456 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
132457 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
132458 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
132459 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
132460 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
132461 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
132462 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
132463 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
132464 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
132465 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
132466 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
132467 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
132468 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
132469 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
132470 evoras dynamically sculptured form and dramatic proportions communicate visual drama speed and agility even when the car is standing still sportscars are primarily an emotional rather than a rational purchase and so the design must seduce with its beauty and distinctive character however the modern customer also demands that the product offers real world usability as well as exotic imagery therefore every element of the cars exterior and interior has been carefully designed to create a product that offers comfort and convenience as well as traditional performance car attributes
132471 we recognise that touch not only assists with driving enjoyment but also conveys messages about quality and therefore great attention has been paid to all the areas where the driver interfaces with the car
132472 the fundamental purpose of the joint venture is to marry what cctv does in china and what img does all over the world

132474 we are pleased to sign a deal with mp amp silva for serie a which will transform us into the market leader of sports broadcasting in switzerland geographically culturally and commercially italian serie a attracts a huge core audience and is one of the most important sporting events for switzerland winning the television rights is going to help us strengthen our market position tremendously

132480 no liquor i came back from the army and came home to the farm one night all liquored up bobby put me out of the house and told me not to come back until i put the bottle down for good i was young and dumb and figured i didnt need this farm packed up my gear and headed out west

132493 i think you better take a look you can tell the other kids what you saw and they wont want to come here anymore either might teach you boys a lesson too
132494 when we moved to that ranch and had those little girls i felt like i finally had something of my own
132495 i didnt own the house but i worked six days a week and saved my money another year and wed have had our own house another five years and wed have had our own ranch after the fire i didnt have anything left there just this box of pictures that the ranch owners wife had taken she gave it to me the day i left
132496 i worked hard six days and we went to church every sunday but on saturdays me and the boys from the ranch would go into town i was falling off a bar stool while my family burned up
132497 youd best i think maybe ive told you boys a little too much about myself

132525 he was a very important person for me i began working with an american theatre company which was actually four of us living in paris we knew becketts work and he was alive and living amongst us the thing that was most interesting about beckett was that he along with the other literary people of that time people like genet people like brecht for that matter what they were involved with and what we have come to see as a classic post modernist approach to literature they were interested in changing the role of the narrative in a story in other words how we tell a story normally weve been telling stories with main characters and events happen to them and the adventures of their lives become a story whether its shakespeare or cocteau thats what it is beckett was one of those people who had a tremendous insight into the ability of drama to exist apart from a normal narrative process especially a work like comedie play which is a story of three people a man his wife and his mistress and they each had a monologue which they talked about their lives together and he cut up the monologue into numerous sections and he recombined them and by doing that he began to tell the story in a radically different way so this idea that we can tell a story but in a different way became the basis of a lot of modern work and became for me a great influence on what i began to do i probably wrote ten scores to plays of his music for endgame comedie all kinds of things the current people who run the beckett estate are in denial that this ever happened by the way they say that beckett did not like music in his pieces that its not allowed in fact i had specific instructions from him about where to put the music and how it should go this very often happens with estates where the authors no longer alive and the people who run the estates are sincerely trying to protect the work actually by protecting the work theyre limiting the work and limiting the possibility of reinterpretation of the work thats already begun to happen to me with my work and ive done it quite differently i think the happy destiny of a theatre work or a literary work is when its allowed to develop and to evolve through the interpretations of another artist

132561 wenn die molterer pl ne eine echte entlastung f r die familien sein sollen dann sind die derzeitigen spritpreise eine echte wohltat f r die autofahrer
132562 es ist zutiefst abzulehnen dass vp chef molterer familien mit kleinkindern eine erh hung der familienbeihilfe schlichtweg verweigert hier soll nicht einmal die inflation abgegolten werden nach den kindergeld r ckforderungen der n chste vp schlag gegen familien mit kleinen kindern
132563 als familienpartei hat sich die vp damit jedenfalls endg ltig disqualifiziert
132564 hat sich ein pflegefall der dringend betreuung braucht aber eben nicht rund um die uhr keine inflationsabgeltung seines pflegegeldes keine erh hung um sich seine existenz leisten zu k nnen und keine absicherung im alter verdient wenn die vp heute sozialkompetenz zeigen wollte dann war das ein kompletter schuss in den ofen
132565 die soziale k ltewelle bei schwarz geht weiter und die sterreicherinnen und sterreicher erhalten weiterhin keinen echten teuerungsausgleich
132566 das gestern pr sentierte ma nahmenpaket des vizekanzlers sehe ich als weiteren wichtigen schritt in richtung entlastung f r die menschen
132567 eine familie mit zwei kleinkindern erh lt zuk nftig rund 240 euro mehr im jahr
132568 ich fordere alle auf sich auch zuk nftig gedanken dar ber zu machen wie der anhaltenden teuerung entgegengewirkt werden kann nicht nur der bund auch die l nder sind gefordert den menschen in dieser schwierigen zeit zu helfen
132569 die tatsache dass wir seit jahren das bundesland mit den niedrigsten energiepreisen sind wurde durch das einfrieren des strompreises f r die zukunft gesichert
132570 die wirtschaftliche entwicklung in sterreich wird im n chsten jahr von einer wachstumsschw che gezeichnet sein
132571 die inflation und die galoppierenden preise werden also ihre spuren auf dem arbeitsmarkt hinterlassen daher ist es jetzt an der zeit gegensteuernde ma nahmen zu ergreifen es ist erfreulich dass die zahl der arbeit suchenden auch im juli zur ckgegangen ist aber man darf den tag nicht vor dem abend loben
132572 z hlt man die registrierten arbeitslosen und die in schulungsma nahmen des arbeitmarktservice befindliche personen zusammen liegen wir noch immer ber den zahlen von 2000
132573 mehr aufmerksamkeit und hilfe durch die arbeitsmarkpolitik gewidmet wird die besch ftigungspakete der sozialpartner f r jugendliche und ltere m ssen umgesetzt werden
132574 frauen in ihrem beruflichen werdegang zu unterst tzen und zu f rdern sowie die vereinbarkeit von familie und beruf durch flexible und qualitative kinderbetreuungsangebote zu erleichtern das sind die grundpfeiler einer verantwortungsvollen frauenpolitik die in wien seit jahren umgesetzt wird denn unser wichtigstes ziel ist es frauen ein selbstst ndiges und unabh ngiges leben erm glichen zu k nnen
132575 die frauenerwerbsquote in wien betr gt 75 8 prozent und liegt damit mit der m nnererwerbsquote von 76 5 prozent beinahe gleichauf im sterreichdurchschnitt liegt die frauenerwerbsquote nur bei 63 prozent dieses erfreuliche hohe quote ist das resultat einer starken frauenpolitik f r wien die sich an 365 tagen im jahr f r die gleichberechtigung der frauen einsetzt
132576 diese einzigartige institution bietet allen wienerinnen hilfe an um sich fortzubilden und so ein eigenst ndiges und unabh ngiges leben verwirklichen zu k nnen
132577 diese hohe zahl beweist den erfolg und die beliebtheit der angebote des waff daher stellt der waff heuer 6 millionen euro speziell f r frauenprogramme zur verf gung
132578 die hohe wiener frauenbesch ftigungsquote beweist dass hier die vereinbarkeit von familie und beruf bereits realit t ist und gelebt wird dazu leisten die flexiblen kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen einen gro en beitrag denn wien hat nicht nur die h chste kindergartendichte und die meisten ganztageskinderg rten von allen bundesl ndern sondern bietet auch die l ngsten ffnungszeiten und die wenigsten schlie tage im jahr 93 prozent aller kinder von drei bis sechs jahren besuchen hier einen kindergarten und durch die soziale staffelung der beitr ge zahlt ein drittel der eltern nichts weitere 40 prozent einen erm igten beitrag und nur ein viertel den vollen betreuungsbetrag
132579 diese bilanz nach 18 monaten kann sich durchaus sehen lassen vor allem sind au erdem f r wichtige projekte wie disability flexicurity leiharbeit von behinderten menschen oder die verbesserungen der gleichstellungsrechte die vorbereitungsarbeiten praktisch abgeschlossen das kann rasch umgesetzt werden
132580 die aktuellen arbeitsmarktdaten in wien geben anlass zur freude minus 7 6 prozent sind ein sensationelles ergebnis besonders erfreulich ist auch der deutliche r ckgang der lehrstellensuchenden jugendlichen mit minus 12 7 prozent berhaupt ist der gesamt sterreichische r ckgang bei den arbeitslosenzahlen zu einem gutteil wien zu verdanken dieses positive ergebnis best tigt den arbeitsmarktpolitischen kurs der stadtregierung und straft all jene l gen die behaupten arbeitslosigkeit w re ein naturgesetz das sich nicht angehen lie e
132581 hier werden erfolgreich neue jobs geschaffen f r die gesamte ostregion schon heute arbeiten in der bundeshauptstadt 208 000 personen aus den bundesl ndern wohingegen lediglich 80 000 wienerinnen au erhalb wiens erwerbst tig sind in wien finden die menschen chancen und m glichkeiten die sie anderswo missen
132582 abgesehen von investitionen in den arbeitsmarkt und wirtschaftsf rderung stehen wir auf dem standpunkt dass qualifikation jobs und m glichkeiten schafft und mit dem wiener arbeitnehmerf rderungsfonds waff und dessen ma geschneiderten programmen verf gen wir in wien ber eine sterreichweit einzigartige institution hierf r
132583 besch ftigung und chancen sind f r die menschen absolut zentrale themen von der vp gibt es dazu rein gar nichts arbeitsminister bartenstein tut das was er am besten kann die h nde fest verschr nkt halten und finanzminister molterer verweigert sich immer noch einer raschen steuerreform umso besser f r die sp am 28 september
132584 damit hat wien zum vierten mal in folge die h chste reduktion aller bundesl nder geschafft
132585 jede kr ftige konjunktureintr bung wirkt sich auf den arbeitsmarkt aus ich freue mich dass bei uns der positive trend noch anh lt
132586 seit nunmehr 29 monaten in folge sinken die arbeitslosenzahlen in sterreich auch bei der frauen und jugendarbeitslosigkeit hat sich dieser positive trend im juli fortgesetzt
132587 die zahlreichen arbeitsmarktpolitischen ma nahmen der vergangenen jahre wie beispielsweise das programm jobs4you th oder der 2005 eingef hrten blum bonus zeigen wirkung aber auch das neue bereits in kraft getretene jugendbesch ftigungspaket wird diesen positiven trend auch in zukunft unterst tzen
132588 an diesem tag k nnen sich sch ler innen lehrer innen und eltern sterreichweit auf zahlreichen events ber die umfangreichen berufschancen durch eine lehre informieren gemeinsam mit unseren partnern aus der wirtschaft werden wir ein starkes signal f r die qualit t in der lehre setzen denn schlie lich sind die lehrling von heute die nachgefragten facharbeitskr fte von morgen
132589 eine stark wachsende zahl an ausgewiesenen bildungsexpertinnen zeigt sich ber den vorsto von wiens b rgermeister dr michael h upl nach einf hrung einer verpflichtenden vorschule ab dem 5 lebensjahr der kinder erfreut und unterst tzt dieses anliegen
132590 man k nnte sogar schon mit vier jahren beginnen die kinder p dagogisch zu f rdern im internationalen vergleich hat sterreich hier aufholbedarf die argumentation der opposition h upl raube den f nfj hrigen ihre kindheit ist eine falsche alte ideologie der vorschlag h upls soll jetzt frei diskutiert werden
132591 der ehemalige steirische vp landesschulratspr sident bernd schilcher ist bekanntlich nicht irgendjemand sondern einer der profiliertesten bildungsexperten sterreichs seine beurteilungen haben argumentationsgewicht
132592 eine meinung die die wiener sp voll und ganz teilt
132593 vor dem hintergrund dieser situation w re die wiener vp vor allem deren bildungssprecherin cortolezis schlager gut beraten sich die meinung der ausgewiesenen bildungsexpertinnen im interesse des wohles der kinder zu herzen zu nehmen und endlich dazu aufzuraffen eine seri se diskussion ber den vorsto von b rgermeister h upl zu f hren mit begriffen aus der bildungspolitischen mottenkiste und verbalen untergriffen sowie wahlkampf kraftmeiereien ist dem ziel mehr chancen f r die j ngsten der gesellschaft egal ihrer sozialen herkunft zu schaffen jedenfalls nicht gedient
132594 die nachlassende konjunktur bekommen die ganz jungen und die lteren zuerst zu sp ren
132595 h tte bartenstein nicht monatelang die umsetzung blockiert k nnte das paket jetzt schon in kraft sein rechtzeitig vor dem prognostizierten einbrechen der konjunktur
132596 daf r braucht es eine dauerhafte aufstockung der mittel f r aktive arbeitsmarktpolitik zus tzlich muss das personal des ams zur besseren betreuung der arbeit suchenden aufgestockt werden
132597 der arbeitsmarkt ist in vielen bereichen l ngst offen klar ist aber dass die qualifizierung der in sterreich lebenden in und ausl nderinnen vorrang haben muss vor dem unbeschr nkten hereinholen neuer kr fte ich erwarte mir hier mehr sensibilit t und auch wirtschaftspolitische vernunft
132598 die arbeitsbedingungen liegen in vielen betrieben im argen statt auf qualit t und qualifizierung zu setzen und damit die fluktuation zu verringern schreien die arbeitgeber aber stets nach neuen billigen und willige kr ften aus dem ausland
132599 von den rund 68 000 neuen jobs die es im ersten quartal 2008 mehr gab als im ersten quartal 2007 sind laut mikrozensus 53 000 teilzeitarbeitspl tze aktuell arbeiten bereits 935 000 frauen teilzeit von einem teilzeitjob leben zu k nnen geht sich angesichts der teuerung aber oft nicht aus
132600 der heute bekannt gewordene fall geballter krimineller energie und gewalt von jugendlichen zeigt einmal mehr welche bedeutung und welche aufmerksamkeit dem bereich der kinder und jugendkriminalit t gegeben werden muss
132601 die entwicklung der letzten monate und jahre darf nicht bersehen werden dieser fall ist beispielhaft
132602 gerade dieser fall zeigt dass es weder gerechtfertigt noch sinnvoll ist dass unter 14 j hrige ungeschoren und ohne konsequenzen davonkommen auch f r unter 14 j hrige m ssen diversionelle ma nahmen wie gemeinn tzige arbeit schadensgutmachung oder t ter opferausgleich m glich sein das ist durchaus zumutbar und zur st rkung und bildung des unrechtsbewusstseins notwendig
132603 mir geht es keinesfalls darum unsere gesamte jugend oder unsere kinder schlecht zu reden aber die entwicklungen darf man nicht sch nreden man darf nicht wegsehen sondern muss das problem aktiv angehen und gegenwirken
132604 ein wesentlicher faktor ist und bleibt nat rlich das elternhaus die erziehungsberechtigten diese verantwortung kann man ihnen nicht nehmen ganz im gegenteil
132605 das unrechtsbewusstsein insbesondere bei kindern ist wesentlich genau das fehlt oft vollkommen genau deshalb m ssen auch konsequenzen gesetzt werden
132606 ich habe diese entwicklung bereits beim antritt meines amtes als innenministerin zu einem schwerpunkt meiner arbeit erkl rt und die entwicklung von strategien und erarbeitung von ma nahmen in auftrag zu geben um dem problemfeld wirksam zu begegnen
132607 die beralterung der gesellschaft und die abwanderung aus den l ndlichen regionen sind ernsthafte probleme denen wir uns alle stellen m ssen wir haben aber die ideen das wissen und die fachkompetenz um die folgen dieser entwicklung zu bew ltigen
132608 wir m ssen die arbeit zu den menschen bringen damit die menschen nicht der arbeit in die ballungsr ume nachziehen m ssen jemand der jeden tag 30 kilometer pendeln muss der wird irgendwann dort hinziehen wo die arbeit ist
132609 der aktuelle finanzausgleich ist zwar besser als der bisherige da gibt es aber schon noch viel zu tun damit hier chancengleichheit zwischen den ballungsr umen und den kleinen gemeinden herrscht
132610 infrastruktur ist ein standortfaktor wir brauchen sie damit auch mehrere gemeinden gemeinsam wirtschaftsstandorte schaffen k nnen
132611 wir m ssen auch endlich verstehen dass gewisse regionen die geographisch benachteiligt sind h here wirtschaftsf rderungen bekommen m ssen analog zu den ziel 1 gebieten der eu sollte man auch national definieren welche regionen besonderer f rderungen und unterst tzungen bed rfen
132612 dieser entwicklung werden wir in sterreich entgegen arbeiten wir haben die ideen und die rezepte daf r
132613 in der zwischenzeit ist es selbstverst ndlich und f r uns nicht verhandelbar dass die pendlerpauschale erh ht werden muss damit die menschen es sich berhaupt noch leisten k nnen in die arbeit zu fahren
132614 diese initiative steht derzeit das ist f r uns nicht akzeptabel weil die versorgung mit breitband verbindungen eine standortfrage ist
132615 das ist der falsche weg damit unterst tzen wir wohlhabende st dter die in die umlandgemeinden hinaus ziehen die zielrichtung der wohnbauf rderung geh rt umgedreht damit es wieder attraktiver wird auch in l ndlichen gemeinden einen wohnsitz zu errichten
132616 das w rde den sofortigen tod vieler kleinschulen in l ndlichen gemeinden bedeuten davon halte ich naturgem nicht das geringste
132617 allein f r die kinderbetreuung sind insgesamt drei ministerien zust ndig bei der pflege sind es zwei das versteht in den gemeinden kein mensch wir sind gewohnt dass die dinge effizient und klar zuordenbar abgewickelt werden hier h tte der bund berdies gewaltige einsparungsm glichkeiten
132618 kinderbetreuung muss sache der gemeinden sein die k nnen das einfach am besten nat rlich muss dann auch das daf r vorgesehene geld mitgehen um die gesundheit sollen sich die l nder k mmern
132619 es w re wichtig dass wir gemeinsame ziele definieren benchmarks setzen und damit auch gemeinsam die qualit t der versorgung sichern es bringt niemandem etwas wenn es hier in neun bundesl ndern neun verschiedene modelle gibt
132620 das kinderbetreuungsangebot in nieder sterreich gibt nur wenigen eltern die chance einer vollbesch ftigung nachzugehen
132621 in unserem land sind nur 2 55 prozent der kinder so untergebracht dass den eltern ein full time job m glich w re mit dieser quote liegt unser bundesland sterreichweit an vorletzter stelle
132622 nieder sterreich sollte sich ein beispiel an der sp gef hrten steiermark nehmen wo erst gestern gemeinsam mit der vp die gratis ganztagesbetreuung beschlossen wurde
132623 au erdem scheint die vp eine selektive wahrnehmung zu haben denn der rechnungshofbericht streut n keineswegs nur rosen sondern kritisiert ganz klar die ffnungszeiten der kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen und best tigt die notwendigkeit zus tzlicher betreuungspl tze
132624 die vp n schwimmt in ihrer suppensch ssel dahin und wehrt sich dagegen auch einmal ber den tellerrand hinauszusehen die negativen konsequenzen tragen wieder einmal die nieder sterreicherinnen und hier vor allem die frauen
132625 die volkspartei sollte sich endlich einmal durchringen nicht nur durch die parteipolitische brille zu sehen sondern konstruktiv f r die menschen und f r nieder sterreich zusammenarbeiten

132655 the eu has come under a lot of criticism for the fact that it is rather reluctant and slow in the negotiations with turkey having in a sense contributed to the crisis

132722 there is a big difference between being anti american and being critical of the united states
132723 the fundamental role of anti americanism in europe in general and particularly among those on the left is to absolve themselves of their own moral failings and intellectual errors by heaping them onto the monster scapegoat the united states of america the u s is charged with all the evils real or imagined that afflict humanity from the falling price of beef in france to aids in africa and global warming everywhere the result is a widespread refusal to accept responsibility for ones own actions
132724 anti americanism is hypocrisy at its finest you can spend your evening catching the latest episode of
132725 it all boils down to the fact that knowledge and intelligence are two different issues rote memorization of world capitals does not equate intelligence
132726 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
132727 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
132728 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
132729 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
132730 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
132731 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
132732 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
132733 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
132734 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
132735 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
132736 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
132737 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
132738 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
132739 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
132740 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
132741 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
132742 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
132743 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
132744 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage
132745 with a military that has become a laughing stock and her increasing irrelevance in the world around her i believe that the canada i know and loved is gone
132746 recently we met and we agreed that each geo political zone should identify projects considered priorities to the tune of n10 billion we want to ensure geo political spread of projects
132747 as the president and father of the nation he is in the best position to right wrongs redress injustices and give a sense of belonging to ndigbo as a whole
132748 south eastern governors have decided to demand for an additional state to match all other geo political zones in the country following the decision that states should be the federating units it was agreed that the south east being the only zone with five states should have an additional one state to be at par with others that have six states with the exception of north west zone which has seven states
132749 our people have in the interest of political parity and even economic development always demanded that an additional state be created in the south east our understanding and conviction is that your excellency is well disposed to this request for an additional state in the south east our collective request therefore is that you give a reaffirmation of this support for the creation of this additional state after which our people will sit on our own and decide from which states of the south east the proposed new state will be carved out
132750 cluster of industries which have all collapsed due to energy crisis
132751 to now exclude the south east in the national gas policy shows a deliberate ploy calculated not just to ruin the ailing industries but to ensure that the area does not recover economically
132752 short changed in the new power infrastructure planned to be put in place to resuscitate the sector least infrastructure has been planned for the region in spite of vibrant socio economic activities the area is known for
132753 even the present planned concept of industrial cluster arrangement by your government can be most suitable for this region which already has existing industrial clusters the federal government can conveniently use as basis for the take off of that concept we appeal to mr president to declare these clusters eligible for electricity clusters

132755 with this initiative investment plans will be freed up and we will promote a larger participation of photovoltaic investments in electricity generation
132756 this initiative is aimed at boosting the share of renewable energy sources in total energy output to 20 percent by 2020

132758 knapp drei monate nach dem zyklon nargis brauchen die berlebenden noch immer hilfe
132759 mehr noch die bev lkerung myanmars hat sich bereits vor dem sturm in einer dramatischen situation befunden von der man aber nur wenig erfahren hat
132760 zu einer chronischen krise kam mit nargis eine akute katastrophe dazu
132761 die menschen leiden weiter und wir d rfen sie nicht allein lassen
132762 es gibt weiter viel zu tun und daf r ist die hilfe von vielen organisationen notwendig
132763 in den vergangenen monaten hat sich die situation aber noch einmal drastisch verschlimmert gleichzeitig erleben wir wie die menschen immer weniger hilfe erhalten
132764 wir wissen nicht wie lang die projekte ohne internationale experten auskommen k nnen
132765 obwohl alle tsunamispenden bereits bis ende 2006 vollst ndig eingesetzt wurden verblieb eine hohe freie r cklage f r die mehrausgaben
132766 das internationale gase und anlagenbaugesch ft l uft weiterhin stabil wir haben allen grund zuversichtlich in die zukunft zu blicken
132767 die zahlen sind gut vor allem der anlagenbau hat positiv berrascht
132768 wenn man wei dass es im vergleich zum vorjahr ein verkaufstag weniger war sind wir von diesen zahlen nicht entt uscht
132769 wir gehen insgesamt davon aus dass wir im sommer eine durststrecke zu berstehen haben
132770 wir gehen im laufenden gesch ftsjahr im konzern von einer umsatzrendite vor steuern von mindestens 4 aus

132776 basically he was trying to stand up for the area where he had lived for more than 20 years it must have been the stress from the incident that caused it frank would help anyone that was his nature he would always stick up for people especially those who needed help
132777 frank successfully engages young people from disadvantaged backgrounds often for little reward
132778 the whole idea of starting the football team was to help children i have known him since i was 19 and he could not have been a better person
132779 he loved helping other people out he was a genuine man and there are not enough of those today
132780 there was a row and the boy was swearing at him then he just keeled over he collapsed on the stairs back up to the door of his flat
132781 a post mortem found that the man died from heart failure there are not believed to be suspicious circumstances and the case has been passed to the coroner
132782 he told police he should have known better at his age
132783 we all know of streakers and people like that at football and cricket matches but i think this was a streak with a difference
132784 in his police interview he said i did it for a laugh i showed my maggot to make my mates laugh
132785 that was his intention he didnt intend to offend anyone obviously some people may have taken offence but he really didnt intend anything of that nature
132786 in wisconsin we have a combination of events that are all coming together
132787 this is a long term issue thats going to have long term effects unless we can find a way to address it
132788 it is a concern and right now the biggest concern is we have a growing list of bridge needs that is growing faster than the available funding
132789 in terms of national average wisconsins bridges generally rate very good and are on a very high scale in terms of their rating
132790 wisconsin has always been very aggressive in its bridge program
132791 you make sure they are in good condition to make sure they are evaluated biannually every two years
132792 theres some maintenance work that needs to be done on a lot of them
132793 its not that they are going to fall down when you drive over them
132794 its like anything else there are things that wear out you have to balance the need of maintaining it with replacement
132795 wisconsin has always been very good about prioritizing bridge work
132796 we take repairing and having good bridges very seriously ideally we would have money to have zero deficient bridges but we are doing a good job with the dollars that we have
132797 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes paris is out of town and not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
132798 they act like a pack of wolves stalking their prey
132799 what were trying to do is prevent a tragedy from happening
132800 i am just absolutely shocked at his obstinacy we are trying to do something positive
132801 i have lost a bit of confidence in the laws
132802 you can either name the law after what it prevents or you can name it after the first person who is killed
132803 you got a rock star out of bed at 8 oclock in the morning so this must be important

132829 anguished cries will ring out from cubicles around north america today
132830 but we will learn to love again mwai kibaki and the december 2007 elections in kenya
132831 she swims with sean hutchison too and she just broke the world record in the 200 back
132832 man sentenced to 10 years in prison for firearms conviction
132833 rodriguez being with the team gives us the opportunity to be a contender its great
132834 we have to do the job with what we have i think the guys have done a tremendous job veras ramirez robertson all those three kids have been outstanding for us
132835 a tremendous catcher one of the best catchers there is
132836 this is a very good team and we know we have to play at a high level to beat them
132837 we worked the count and we got pettitte one of the nastiest lefties in the game
132838 ive got one responsibility and thats to try to give this team a chance to win
132839 i didnt do it tonight against a good team its pretty embarrassing
132840 one pitch one mistake thats too much the ball didnt hit him
132841 i just feel happy about the job ive been doing here
132842 im proud of myself for giving this team what they need at the time jorgie went down
132843 hes a free agent at the end of the year we have a catcher signed
132844 they got good jumps and stole their bases we knew they were a running team it was a long day but im ready for tomorrow
132845 it might take a few days to learn the pitchers
132846 i still have to watch and see a lot of stuff it doesnt happen right away it will get better
132847 love to keep wearing the yankees uniform for a long time
132848 well try our best to cut the running game out
132849 nady is starting to swing the bat so were excited about him and marte is not a comfortable at bat for left handers
132850 then you get pudge rodriguez one of the best catchers of all time
132851 i have seen sidney and ras throw the ball really well its important for sidney to get his sinker working and we have seen him do that for ras its changing speeds and i have seen him do that
132852 i believe in those guys this is what we are going to win with
132853 n early half of cbss online audience is composed of viewers who only or mostly watch episodes online which opens the door to a net gain of 21 percent of web only viewers who are now more likely to watch tv because they connected with the show online
132854 short form video is an emerging entertainment genre distinct from online tv that consistently proves popular with people of widely varying backgrounds and tastes as demonstrated yet again by the magid survey
132855 online video has quickly become not only a mainstream cultural phenomena but also a powerful marketing vehicle for brands that want to reach consumers who no longer watch as much television and even fewer tv commercials
132856 for the first time we have been able to demonstrate that the pattern of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere through decomposition is governed by the same properties everywhere from the arctic circle to tropical rain forests
132857 this provides a mathematical way of describing a critical natural process
132858 one of the key findings of this study is that microbes can adapt and do fairly well in a nutrient poor environment
132859 when their diet is lacking in nitrogen microbes tend to react by releasing more carbon dioxide into the air and taking in less mineral nitrogen from the soil so plants can get the much needed mineralized nitrogen earlier in the decomposition process from the fallen organic matter
132860 for this reason if more carbon is added to the soil in the form of plant residues the microbes would then just pump out more carbon in response
132861 it only takes one idiot to lash out and someone could be seriously injured
132862 some people get really aggressive after a few drinks lecturing them and handing out sticks will just make things worse
132863 it is a bit tongue in cheek but it is a serious message be responsible for your actions its not nice after they have left their mess behind
132864 the global energy market comprehensive strategies to meet geopolitical and financial risks the g 8 energy security and global climate issues
132865 sharp changes in energy prices are having dramatic effects on the stability of the global economy
132866 threats to the global energy market could have dangerous corresponding impacts on the world financial system
132867 petrodollar flows play a major role in the current credit bubble dilemma
132868 countries with dollar denominated assets need to cooperate to find a transition path that weans the united states from foreign credit and foreign oil while at the same time moves emerging economies away from excessive export oriented dependence on us consumption
132869 it also will require expanded effort to find additional options to increase the capacities of middle east energy exporting countries to absorb petrodollar inflows through investment in appropriate forms of human and physical capital
132870 it is our belief be it material belief or spiritual belief we believe that these rituals are for the benefit of the mankind these rituals are not just for the benefit of the individual this will be beneficial for the entire world
132871 we pray to lord shiva during eclipse we consider that eclipse means a bad omen that is why people from across the country come here on the day of solar eclipse
132872 the one way that we can keep our hand in the fight is that we transition to a future weapons system and thats the mq 9 weapons system
132873 the airplane is a very symbolic thing because you can go out there you can touch it you can see it you can watch it
132874 when we move from the f 16 to the mq 9 theres really going to be a generational change in mentalities there wont be mq 9s flying out of syracuse international airport every day so there wont be the noise there wont be the visual or physical presence of the aircraft anymore
132875 the skills are transferable in the sense that you have to lean forward and you need to have an open mind
132876 thats an enlisted position and theres no equivalent job in the 174th fw today that clearly realigns to that mission
132877 once this mq 9 package is up and running well be doing deployed operations
132878 there will still be a subset of people who go down range to launch and maintain this system but its a significant footprint shrinkage
132879 it will be a sad day when the last f 16 departs hancock field because with it will be many memories and some top notch maintainers
132880 but in the air national guard our survival dictates that we remain flexible and open to change so if it requires us to take on a uas mission for the unit to flourish and provide a future for the next generation of 174th fw members then lets roll
132881 most everybody has other jobs that theyre leaving at home being in the guard
132882 everybody wants to contribute to the cause so its pretty exciting for us to come out here as our final f 16 deployment and to really be at the tip of the spear
132883 i would be nowhere else in the world than right here right now this is the place this is where we have to be this is what we need to be here to do
132884 the same way as waste vapour is drawn out of this material to make hikers more comfortable to less prone to hypothermia so it is able to breathe oxygen into our fuel cell and into contact with the conductive plastic
132885 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
132886 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable
132887 the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
132888 the small amounts of carbon monoxide that are always present in exhausts from petrol engines are a real problem for fuel cells because the platinum catalyst is slowly poisoned eventually destroying the cell
132889 the important point to stress is that the team has come up with an alternative fuel cell design that is more economical more easily sourced outlasts platinum cells and is just as effective
132890 there has been a proposal submitted and its a very interesting one
132891 he is not going to be a junior officer he will be there in a visiting role to observe

132933 although discussions are progressing well we are not in a position to make an announcement before or during the regatta
132934 cowes week is a superb event that has a huge amount to offer and of course it is important to remember the regatta has run very successfully for more than 180 years going from strength to strength
132935 dont just sit there and waste your precious time when you want to do something do it right away do it when you can its the only way to live a life without regrets
132936 i accept the involvement of the palliative care team may have been more appropriate in this case at an earlier stage and this will be discussed further with the clinical staff involved
132937 however i do not believe the care mr waddington received prior to the teams involvement was detrimental to his condition
132938 to my immense shock and deep distress he did squeeze my hand and he repeated this with a nurse present to her shock suddenly my dad was treated like a human being again and was given more pain relief
132939 had we not been there he would have been left to die without adequate pain control he had suffered for almost 18 hours before he got it thankfully in the end he was peaceful and comfortable which is how we all wanted it to be
132940 it is a bit over the top they had consulted cowes town council and we knew nothing about it what are you going to do about children wanting to go to the loo if they are penned in i just believe the whole situation is ridiculous
132941 it will create more problems than it solves it is excessive and demeaning to pen mums dads and their children in is just outrageous
132942 people are going to be put off by the fences it is going to halt passing trade it is completely unnecessary

132944 he was forced to remain entangled in the undergrowth throughout the whole of tuesday shouting for help but due to the remoteness of his location his calls were in vain
132945 i was at the top of the cliff and could hear calling at first i thought it was an animal but the calls were too regular and human sounding i called to see if i could get a response but there was nothing
132946 im just so relieved it was not a false alarm and that it all had such a happy outcome
132947 he got himself into a situation he couldnt really get out of he had lost his water and he had no signal on his mobile phone it was a nightmare situation
132948 he got very cut up by the branches and slowly but surely he just got weaker and weaker had the dog walker not heard his calls then he may not have been found
132949 its position to the west of the existing school will also maximise the use of natural light and provide inspirational views across the solent

132977 newsblues regularly reports on each of the television stations corresponding to domain names i purchased
132978 station call letters are decreasingly part of a web domain
132979 today u s tv stations rarely refer to themselves by their station call letters the value of a dot tv domain is reduced to little more than a domain forward and as a result the value is extremely diminished
132980 we have over 600 brands to protect including our callsigns and stations may end up using their call letters more and more instead of their channel numbers
132981 we cant afford to let these domains fall into the wrong hands
132982 the power of the tv extension is in part that tv means the same thing to people in china as it does to people in spain or the united states
132983 you turn it on and overnight it downloads television programs from the tv station

133001 our photo prints pure photo albums and photo posters are all printed on fuji archival quality photo paper which makes the quality un matched in addition he went on to say our philosophy is to offer customers innovative services outstanding quality and sensational service at affordable prices
133002 after making the decision to create the tattoo sourcebook i immediately began researching studios and websites that had access to different tattoo designs
133003 i spoke to tattoofinder com owner lou bardach and he thought the sourcebook concept as i presented it was a fantastic idea but it wasnt enough he wanted to give an authoritative and informative introduction to the tattoo process and he couldnt have been more right nearly 2 000 designs and 40 different artists later the tattoo sourcebook was born
133004 we approach these collaborative efforts first and foremost by focusing on our customers needs
133005 we then look for innovative ways to leverage our assets and build mutually beneficial relationships with other companies oftentimes valuing our long term goals over short term monetary gains
133006 our decision to work with tattoofinder was based on the incredible volume of traffic their site generates
133007 as well as their solid ethical reputation as the leading source for high quality tattoo designs it takes time for a newer company to build a strong presence on the web and doing so generally requires a huge advertising budget we felt working with tattoofinder com in co branded content distribution was a good move for both parties we look forward to finding other creative ways to work together to enhance each others brand extend our reach and increase industry authority
133008 the secret to our success is giving our visitors exactly what they want in the most clear direct way possible
133009 what our customers want is great tattoo artwork and reliable information and my mission is to make this experience as easy and effective as possible its not some kind of seo trick or backroom dealings with search engines like google in fact its the exact opposite philosophy thats made us successful honesty tattoofinder com has become synonymous with top quality tattoo artwork and authoritative information about the tattoo process simply because thats what we offer nothing more nothing less

133011 our artwork is a powerhouse resource not only as tattoo friendly reference to get inked but also for merchandise friendly advertising friendly and promotion friendly tattoo images while people fanatically tattoo their skin businesses are equally enthusiastic about tattooing clothing electronic devices advertising campaigns and sometimes their company identity
133012 our customers are interested in fashion sports music and entertainment all industries with very strong ties historically and socially to the tattooed and tattoo culture in general from a marketing perspective its in our interest to build integrated long term business relationships with companies having good tattoo synergy we develop and foster these strategic partnerships through trust over time and with each party looking for new and creative ways to support and collaboratively promote each other
133013 we could have simply licensed artwork to harpercollins for the tattoo sourcebook
133014 but we saw an opportunity to work with them more closely to produce and promote a truly epic book we could have simply sold advertising space to inked magazine on our website but saw opportunity in the magazines high end print market we took a creative approach in both cases toward building solid long term business relationships that have benefited us benefited our partners and most importantly benefited our customers

133025 raffles st lucia offers a legendary opportunity to create a legacy for buyers from europe and asia as well as north america the escalating demand from markets like the uk is quite remarkable especially for offerings like this one where scarcity is such a driving factor
133026 there really werent many opportunities for people to redeem themselves we wanted to see success stories but we faced overcrowded courtrooms budget crisis staff shortages as well as skepticism from judges and attorneys to give persons charged with crimes a second chance
133027 someone needed to inspire a change to wake the system up and really focus on developing alternatives for the court system
133028 the success of one of my clients has the effect of giving the next client more consideration for an alternative program by the court and prosecutor this is something i try to emphasize to each client that someone else in the future may get that second chance based on their success in this program

133033 the launch of world of kung fu into western markets represents the culmination of many months of strenuous effort and is a real milestone for vestgame its very satisfying to see so many new players enjoying the fruits of our labor
133034 its unusual to find a game that succeeds so well in combining different styles of gameplay together in such a huge well balanced and ultimately enjoyable package it has been a great pleasure to oversee the production of this outstanding game
133035 we do not view modern as a trend with a set style one moment angular the next soft and rounded it is more a state of mind which exploits the unique and elegant character imparted by a flowing and purposeful sheer line and receives and translates it into the various other lines and shapes which create the deckhouses and the total yacht
133036 too many people in our community are being stretched by the economic environment and we sought a company that would be willing to sit down discuss the subject and come to a resolution that would benefit our community
133037 pls check cashers was willing to do this and together we formed a plan to meet the needs of the community in these difficult times

133043 our data suggests that wheelchair restriction definitely impairs functional recovery in rats and logically it would seem to apply also to humans
133044 russia and the european space agency have heavy commitments so we have teamed up with some emerging space nations
133045 i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
133046 prior to this study the gravity tractor deflection technique had been proven in only a conceptual way
133047 although there were few if any substantive criticisms of these concepts some of us had the feeling that the ideas were viewed as quaint but not ready for prime time
133048 the jpl study gives it the solid engineering underpinnings that we never really doubted but now are there for anyone to see
133049 the gravity tractor is a wimp but its a precise wimp
133050 it can make very small precise changes in orbit and thats what you need to avoid a keyhole
133051 we have a little bitty spacecraft with this monster swinging its butt at it
133052 born of a single quantum event the universe is at some basic level a single interconnected quantum system there are no truly independent pieces of this system and therefore no random and uncontrollable interactions to impose a classical solidity on the quantum maelstrom once a quantum system always a quantum system
133053 rotation of a superfluid is not uniform but takes place via a lattice of quantized vortices virtual planckian black holes
133054 a more fundamental property than the disappearance of viscosity becomes visible if superfluid is placed in a rotating container
133055 there could be a way to feel the ether more directly theory predicts that the quantum vacuum behaves in some ways like a viscous fluid according to general relativity a gravitational field is just a distortion of the geometry of space time and it turns out that bending space puts a strain on the quantum ether if this strain changes with time you get friction leonard parker discovered in the late 1960s that an expanding or contracting universe would create particles out of a pure vacuum in effect the stretching of space jiggles up some of the virtual particles and turns them into real particles
133056 rotation of a superfluid is not uniform but takes place via a lattice of quantized vortices
133057 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the us dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker us economy
133058 we assume that 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
133059 we had expected an additional risk provisioning in q2 and a profit warning for the full year 2008 but not to this extent
133060 measures aimed at improving residual values and reducing bad debts will be pursued more intensely
133061 what we like is that the residual value risks are now covering not only the maturities for 2008 but also the years 2009 and 2010
133062 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
133063 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
133064 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
133065 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
133066 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
133067 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
133068 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
133069 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
133070 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
133071 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
133072 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
133073 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
133074 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
133075 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
133076 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
133077 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
133078 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
133079 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
133080 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
133081 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
133082 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
133083 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
133084 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
133085 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
133086 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
133087 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
133088 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen

133093 peralihan kuasa wanita kena tunggu dulu kita tidak bincang dalam mesyuarat kali ini
133094 hari ini kita bincang perkembangan terkini yang berlaku termasuk dalam bidang ekonomi

133100 it just didnt happen for us at stafford that said i would rather have a poor game there than when the season starts on the whole we have done very well in pre season and one game will not change that
133101 i let the boys get on with it at stafford i knew they would be a physical side and it was up to us to break through to do that you need to play clever football which we did not do it was still a good test for us because we need to know how to break down physical sides
133102 we are likely to face the same sort of challlenge against certain teams in the blue square premier thats for sure
133103 we actually looked into spending a week in bath and using team baths facilities at the university before the trip to devon came up i was still eager to get this game into the schedule
133104 i know their head coach andy tilson and know that they will be a test we will be putting a strong side out and taking this game very seriously hopefully we can get 70 80 minutes under the belts of a few players as well

133110 cest ironique de voir le pr sident hu renverser la chose en disant que ce sont les trangers qui essayent de politiser les jeux
133111 nous continuerons fournir des moyens pour que les journalistes trangers puissent travailler

133114 the revised order directs the intelligence community to produce timely accurate and insightful intelligence with special emphasis on the threats posed by international terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction
133115 todays actions will help create a more effective intelligence community capable of providing the president and his advisers with information necessary to defend our national and homeland security

133118 not continue to walk around on eggshells for fear of upsetting a possible post election partner
133119 i urge all those involved to stop the name calling the muckraking and the silly games and address the issues so that the public can make its judgment
133120 i wanted to do good i just wanted to do something

133134 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
133135 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
133136 i believe we are now on the way to getting there
133137 i just got the message early this morning that everything had opened up and im very happy about that
133138 and were keeping our promises when bidding for the games to provide good environment and a quality service for reporters using the internet to cover the olympic games and we administer the internet by law
133139 we thought it was a good deal we were ready to accept the deal
133140 i confirm our ambition to be a major actor of the nuclear rebirth in britain we have been working on that for three years and we have taken measures to reach this target
133141 the conditions notably financial ones allowing a major development of edf in britain are not there

133146 the challenges at hand are tough enough they have been made severe by the fact that there is no government in at the moment parliament does not function coalition partners are threatening each other and even within ppp there seems to be rebellion in the making these are not good signs for any government let alone a government in crisis the frustration is even more amusing as their entire investment is now threatened we have no hesitation in saying that the present regime under zardari and ppp with anp and mqm as the coalition partners are the most incompetent corrupt and perhaps dangerous group of suspects to lead the country at this juncture already the seeds of a violent social disintegration are being planted rapidly as if the handlers of this government know that they have only a few more weeks to complete the job and are in a hurry the previous government led by pml q under the guidance of musharraf and premiership of shaukat was perhaps considered as the worst in 60 years history of despite its completion of five years in terms of internal security economic corruption and social division and unrest this present government led by zardari is already on way to surpassing that record in a short span of 3 months
133147 we started to receive reports of flooding about 0750 this morning
133148 we have 35 firefighters on location who are dealing with the affected areas
133149 a zodiac rescue boat is being used in the town and the scottish ambulance service is also in attendance
133150 the water in the worst affected areas is more than one metre deep
133151 were eating this same produce in mexico and we havent had any problems
133152 the farm unit in question ended its harvest more than a month ago so the sample they say they have lacks scientific validity because the sample was taken recently from a tank holding rain water that was not used in production
133153 the government reiterates its call for the fda to use information responsibly and above all to base it on scientific evidence
133154 we are surprised and disappointed by the statements of the mexican government we are confident of our findings
133155 we now have a prototype that delivers a high level of performance
133156 we firmly believe that breastlight will make a huge difference in providing women with an extra level of confidence and reassurance when they carry out their breast awareness routines
133157 what encourages me about this product is that by a combination of invention in scotland and some support from the scottish government we are able to bring to the global market place a very exciting product for the health care of women
133158 it has been developed by the quality and talent of engineers and inventors in scotland thats something we should be very proud of it gives us great foundations for the future of our economy
133159 it opens doors to making patient specific stem cell lines
133160 you can use these cells to make the actual cell type for that persons disease
133161 the current system of classification comes from a time when videogames were in their infancy
133162 we have also seen a big growth in games aimed at a grown up market
133163 which invariably include scenes unsuitable for young people the games market has simply outgrown the classification system so today we are consulting on options that will make games classification useful and relevant again
133164 for this to work best the bbfc and pegi would need to agree to harmonise their logos and age classifications so there is no further potential for confusion
133165 two independent reviews the byron review and the cms select committee report have both come out categorically in favour of a much greater role for the bbfc in games classification we are very happy and able to take on an increased role

133190 es k nnte m glicherweise sein dass er in einer unterschriften liste eine solidarit tsbekundung unterschrieben hat mehr ist mir nicht bekannt
133191 deshalb w ge und w hle genau wer verantwortung f r das land zu vergeben hat wem er sie anvertrauen kann und wem nicht

133218 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease

133244 id like to think we can finish higher than our fourth spot at the end of last season
133245 st johnstone dunfermline partick thistle theyve all been bringing in fresh players strengthening their teams
133246 i dont think the first division will have been stronger
133247 you are always a bit nervous about making predictions on the back of pre season but i honestly think this is the strongest squad we have had at queen of the south in the last seven years and thats no disrespect to past managers
133248 we have a really professional team in gordon chisholm kenny brannigan peter latchford and billy dodds and i think the decision to go full time made a huge difference
133249 with our new signings i really feel we are looking good
133250 the scottish cup uefa or cis it doesnt matter they are the competitions where you can make some money i would hope that we can have another run like last season
133251 i think most people realise we cannot run the club on the income from home gates alone
133252 so we are hoping we can find someone to take over the old tesco site but its a big building and so far we have not been able to find anyone the council doesnt have any use for it
133253 we will keep trying but it might mean we have to look at alternative uses i would think it would have to be something that would be of benefit to the community
133254 whatever we decide it will have to be something that will be sustainable beyond a year or 18 months
133255 when i picked up last weeks paper and read the story about the couple from georgetown who spend 500 per month visiting their premature baby at an edinburgh hospital it brought back memories

133268 you just cant do a 50 box game thats that pure its sad that you have to do everything and the kitchen sink just because its expected

133270 its not about challenging the players its about letting them have fun
133271 if it seems like its doing the job acceptably then its good enough
133272 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
133273 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
133274 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
133275 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
133276 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
133277 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
133278 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase

133281 its the type of thing we spend our careers trying to make sure does not occur
133282 that is not something you would want to leave to somebody else to have to pick up
133283 the bridge did collapse while i was the state bridge engineer so i feel i need to deal with it
133284 daily we spend time dealing with the aftermath of i 35w im not complaining
133285 im not going to tell you that weve never seen a political investigation here before
133286 but this one did have a good deal of political interest and outcry why this was a very highly visible event of incredible magnitude bridges dont fall in the united states its rare that they do very rare
133287 but we do not engage in politics we are not influenced by politics
133288 we are not protecting the governors butt any longer this has got to be done
133289 you can only fiddle with this stuff so long people dont like increases in taxes i dont but i dont know how else to pay for that

133363 ordenanza municipal sobre protecci n de la convivencia ciudadana y prevenci n de actuaciones antisociales
133364 el psoe tiene inter s en evitar que los ciudadanos se organicen desde la base
133365 ordenanza municipal sobre protecci n de la convivencia ciudadana y prevenci n de actuaciones antisociales
133366 esta ordenanza es desproporcionada injusta y represiva la prohibici n de acciones informativas como el reparto de d pticos en la calle o las pegadas de carteles suponen cercenar el nico medio del que dispone el movimiento ciudadano para expresarse y organizarse
133367 el silencio c mplice del psoe seg n interpreta el pce indica que el partido socialista de salamanca tiene un alto inter s en evitar que los ciudadanos se organicen desde la base para no tener cr ticas desde la izquierda
133368 pretendemos que salamanca tenga una ordenanza que asegure la limpieza y seguridad de los bienes p blicos no una ley del silencio contra sindicatos movimientos vecinales y asociaciones ciudadanas
133369 a lo mejor el pp pretende que los ciudadanos participemos mediante mensajes de m vil
133370 a lo mejor el concejal pretende que los ciudadanos participemos escribiendo a su correo personal o que le mandemos mensajes de m vil
133371 restringe al m ximo las posibilidades de participaci n del ciudadano pretende controlar la vida interna de las asociaciones y busca que la participaci n est abierta tan s lo a sectores econ micos privados
133372 es decir el ayuntamiento de salamanca pierde un considerable valor patrimonial de terreno p blico a cambio de un terreno de f tbol de hierba artificial y unos vestuarios
133373 el pleno del ayuntamiento es decir los grupos municipales del psoe y del pp se han comportando hoy como si el terreno municipal fuera de su propiedad para salvar la situaci n econ mica de tres individuos concretos que se cubren en primer lugar tras los dos grupos municipales del ayuntamiento y ahora una vez concedida la permuta tras una sociedad o testaferro denominado inversiones y desarrollos
133374 tanto el psoe como el pp a los que tanto les preocupa la pol tica deportiva deber an preocuparse de dotar de recursos e infraestructuras suficientes para promocionar el deporte en los j venes y su promoci n a los equipos profesionales realizar convenios con los colegios e institutos de la ciudad para poder aprovechar sus instalaciones con la finalidad de que los ni os ni as y j venes salamantinos puedan practicar deporte fuera de los horarios escolares de modo que la uds por ejemplo logre tener en un futuro inmediato una buena cantera de futbolistas de la ciudad esto s que es una competencia pol tica del ayuntamiento y no especular con el terreno municipal que es de todos los salmantinos
133375 el principal foco de atenci n de los equipos de msf ha sido intentar salvar la vida de los ni os con malnutrici n severa el grupo que corre un mayor riesgo

133410 its too early for him to depart from us perhaps he could have done better had he continued to play in the middle order
133411 he was a perfect team man who kept the team members in good humour in the dressing room wadekar said
133412 he was a wonderful middle order batsman who was not allowed to fulfil his potential in his test career because he was converted into an opening batsman for which he was not well equipped
133413 as a middle order batsman he was solid on the lines of polly umrigar and chandu borde but he got converted into an opener and succeeded too initially but i always thought he did not have it in him to be an opener

133435 eu i am spus lui mircea sandu ca vreau sa candidez iar el mi a spus ca nu mai intentioneaza sa faca acest lucru eu inca ma gandeam inainte sa am aceasta discutie cu el pentru ca stiam care sunt sansele mele intr o lupta cu mircea sandu stiam de parghiile pentru lobby pe care le avea dar el a spus ca vrea sa ma sustina si ca ma vrea in fruntea frf trebuia sa stabilim organigrama iar el urma sa ramana doar presedinte onorific
133436 nu stiu cine a venit cu ideea sandu sau giovani insa eu am fost impotriva acestui lucru
133437 oameni care erau contra mea si au dat seama ca au gresit
133438 domnul condescu mi a spus ca vrea sa ma sustina dar a trecut de partea lui mircea sandu daca cele 50 de voturi care au influentat alegerile erau dirijate catre mine acum eram presedinte
133439 acum cativa ani oameni care erau impotriva mea si au dat seama ca au gresit cand m am vazut de exemplu cu gheorghe stefan el mi a spus clar ca e de partea lui mircea sandu
133440 nu am vorbit niciodata cu mircea sandu despre acea suma chiar daca si ieri am zburat cu dansul in acelasi avion

133494 what this means is that in the case of a 20 year loan a 25 bps basis points hike will mean the emi going up by rs 17 for every rs 1 lakh rs 100 000 loan amount in case of a 50 bps hike it will be rs 34 and in case of 75 bps the emi will rise by rs 51
133495 similarly if it is a 15 year loan a 25 bps hike will push up emi by rs 16 a month a 50 bps hike by rs 33 and a 75 bps hike by rs 50
133496 my monthly budget is in a mess i am already paying rs 1 500 more emi from last month and another hike will make situation very difficult for me
133497 for instance in the case of state bank of india the interest rate reset happens at the end of every two years from the date the loan has been disbursed for bank of india the reset is at the end of every five years
133498 after interest rates were hiked i wanted to increase the payment tenure rather than paying higher emi but my bank said the tenure cannot be increased endlessly and asked me to increase the emi as the tenure is crossing my retirement age
133499 we ask customers to change emis rather than opting for increasing the tenure as they may end up paying a whole lot more so the best possible option in this condition for an individual is to opt for an increased emi and maintain the same tenure
133500 jan bought this the first time we went to new york at least 8 or 9 years ago she never wore it she was saving it for a special occasion well i guess this is the occasion

133503 the unemployment rate is giving you a misleading impression of some of the adjustments that are taking place
133504 hours cut is a big deal people still have a job but they are losing income

133508 you may not love me you may not even like me but you will respect me why thanks for introducing me to kelliss bossy songs that remind me of ms murphy amp the strokes which i never thought i liked and no doubts bathwater which is an awesome song
133509 indeed i did have a relationship with miss lewinsky that was not appropriate
133510 in fact it was wrong it constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which i am solely and completely responsible
133511 first of all we have assumed that a majority of americans basically agrees with our point of view that has been the premise upon which we have tried to build any number of institutions and indeed our whole strategy the second premise has been that if we could just elect enough conservatives we could get our people in as congressional leaders and they would fight to implement our agenda
133512 did not result in the adoption of our agenda the reason i think is that politics itself has failed and politics has failed because of the collapse of the culture the culture we are living in becomes an ever wider sewer in truth i think we are caught up in a cultural collapse of historic proportions a collapse so great that it simply overwhelms politics
133513 it is impossible to ignore the fact that the united states is becoming an ideological state the ideology of political correctness which openly calls for the destruction of our traditional culture has so gripped the body politic has so gripped our institutions that it is even affecting the church it has completely taken over the academic community it is now pervasive in the entertainment industry and it threatens to control literally every aspect of our lives let me be perfectly frank about it if there really were a moral majority out there bill clinton would have been driven out of office months ago it is not only the lack of political will on the part of republicans although that is part of the problem more powerful is the fact that what americans would have found absolutely intolerable only a few years ago a majority now not only tolerates but celebrates americans have adopted in large measure the mtv culture that we so valiantly opposed just a few years ago and it has permeated the thinking of all but those who have separated themselves from the contemporary culture i believe that we probably have lost the culture war that doesnt mean the war is not going to continue and that it isnt going to be fought on other fronts but in terms of society in general we have lost this is why even when we win in politics our victories fail to translate into the kind of policies we believe are important
133514 just because we have a new structure that doesnt mean all is well
133515 what people really want is a fundamental political change a change in policies something more substantial
133516 wants to pursue policies that focus on peoples daily lives
133517 this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
133518 even some ldp members have been saying that its better to hold snap elections as early as possible because they dont think they can win elections with fukuda in the prime ministers post
133519 the secretary general operates the entire party its an attractive position for mr aso

133523 marker relies on pattern matching sort of like regular expressions
133524 i most definitely want kids but ill probably adopt kids
133525 theres no formula to this its basically carte blanche as far as extreme metals concerned you can do whatever you want and still keep it within something thats pretty aggressive because thats always the factor in cryptopsy s music but its always a work in progress i dont wanna do another none so vile theres no reason for it
133526 throughout the recording period i couldnt sleep i would stay up lying in bed rethinking all of the parts i had tracked and was wondering if i was actually good enough to be in this band with two of the most influential death metal singers in the band as my predecessors i was extremely worried that i would simply not be up to par but by the time we entered the mixing process i saw the entire band singing along to my vocals so i finally felt that i must have done something right
133527 i dont see how it would be selling out if theres no money involved but everyones entitled to their opinion bottom line is if you dont like it dont listen to it and youve heard the album its very brutal its very fast there are a lot of changes speed wise and power its definitely the most intense so far clean vocals and keyboards are each about eight percent of the album its just more mature as far as songwriting and that was intended
133528 they were fed up with the storylines and murder epics no offense to lord worm s lyrics because i and the band truly believe that this was his strongest point as a frontman but as the music was diversifying the band also wanted the lyrics to reach outside of death metal tradition

133542 we should also protect the player and if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found

133630 the koker was scheduled to be repaired as part of a rehabilitation programme by guysuco and it is unfortunate that before those works were completed a section of the sluice was damaged leading water back into the canal
133631 the minister has ordered an investigation to determine whether there was negligence on the part of guysuco the minister noted that he went on site to ensure that urgent action was taken to repair the door and prevent further intrusion of water

133638 i am really glad that i can go out there and see the best athletes in the world and i think that that will only make me want to participate in the olympics even more
133639 i want to try to learn as much as i can from the other athletes and persons that i meet there so that i can come back and train hard to participate in the next olympics
133640 i know i have to train hard because it will not be easy but i know that i will get there

133650 lack of any real discourse between the state and the business sectors
133651 it may well have been a missed opportunity in a way since the seminar brought together the top state administrators in the privatization investment and taxation sectors and some of the countrys leading businessmen
133652 despite a succession of privatization and local and overseas investment initiatives we have still been unable to provide sufficient better paying jobs to cope with the rising cost of living one of the consequences of our failure to satisfy the need to find jobs for qualified people is that guyana is now listed as being among the highest in the world as far as the brain drain is concerned

133659 the most hideous and barbaric system of human exploitation was abolished
133660 the historical account of slavery is burdened by unspeakable atrocities and adversity it is a history of genocide it is a history of the african holocaust which every conceivable device was employed to reduce a proud and powerful people to commodities
133661 it is an account of the manner in which the african people consistently refused to be broken and resolutely resisted attempts to be reduced to less than human
133662 and as the developed world has determined it practical to proffer fulsome apologies for the atrocities committed during slavery our government must ensure that they respect their obligation promise and commitment

133726 the olympic governing body is full of whites and indians who dont understand transformation and who lack vision
133727 i was not misquoted in the media the portfolio committee and i remain very concerned about transformation in sport
133728 after our meeting we have agreed that we need to deal with the issue of funding and the development of sport first as there is a huge gap
133729 we are both dedicated to working even more vigorously together to accelerate the development of sport and in particular to prioritise the issues of transformation and funding
133730 we differ with the view that constant public battering of sport leadership will yield the outcomes we all desire our view in a nutshell is that we need a national strategy inclusive of all key stakeholders that will address a number of key challenges in a comprehensive and inclusive manner
133731 further not only do we need more resources for effective development of sport we also need to optimise those we already have for instance the national lottery distributes over r500 million a year for sport however it is common cause that the current distribution mechanism is spread too thin and also that the system is inefficient and needs a total overhaul all these issues have been dealt with in our vision 2014 document
133732 when we come back from beijing we will be preparing for the new term which is from 2009 to 2012 we will elect our new board later in the year and address the issues raised accordingly as we will be preparing for the next olympics
133733 we know that transformation is an urgent matter that needs to be dealt with but in order for us to address that we need to look at issues of funding areas that are neglected and provision of facilities so we can nurture talent that will be selected on merit and reflect the demography of our society we are confident that this will be achieved
133734 its the start of a hard court season of eight or nine months so i hope i can start well
133735 but at the same time you know you are on a winning streak at this tournament
133736 i dont know if there is more pressure than wimbledon
133737 when i go out there i expect to win the match win the tournament its not anything new that the number one position looks in more danger than in the past i have to focus look at the big picture prepare well and not go crazy over it
133738 we have the feeling it will happen another 20 times we are right in the prime of the rivalry
133739 this is testimony to the headwinds facing the manufacturing sector
133740 this lower sales business activity does not bode well for activity in the manufacturing sector over the near term pointing to a further reduction in demand consistent with weaker purchasing manager expectations of business conditions in six months
133741 while the recent oil price decline coupled with some appreciation of the currency will bring some relief going forward rising transport and energy costs continue to threaten a recovery in the sector
133742 i dont believe there is anyone who doesnt know im in the tribunals detention unit

133744 you planned ordered committed or otherwise aided and abetted persecution and terror tactics to force non serbs out of parts of bosnia herzegovina that had been proclaimed parts of the bosnian serbian republic it is alleged many of those non serbs were either forcibly deported or killed
133745 i have an invisible adviser but i have decided to represent myself
133746 once again we are in the exact same position that we were before athens
133747 no one really believes we can win a medal and once again we are going in there wanting to win a medal the competition this year is going to be far harder than before but once again anything can happen on any given day at this point in time if we win a medal we dont care what the colour is
133748 im really happy with the way in which training has been going ive tried a couple of things differently since olympic trials and i must admit i am pretty happy with the results so far
133749 the important thing is that things come together at the games its what we spent four years working for
133750 right now i am firmly focused on swimming a great lead off leg in the relay i have a point to prove there and im focused on swimming a great 50m freestyle
133751 aside from that im just looking forward to enjoying the experience im going to take more time to enjoy the olympic experience its a different country and city and the experience will be completely different

134000 a state supreme court justice has dismissed a state lawmakers lawsuit seeking to force the collection of taxes on cigarettes sold by indian retailers the legal victory for the retailers as well as the administration of gov david a paterson means the state department of taxation and finance can continue not to enforce the 2005 law overwhelmingly passed the state legislature that required the state to begin collecting the excise taxes on tobacco sales to non indians lawmakers say the state loses at least 400 million a year by failing to collect the taxes
134001 patersons victory however could be mixed like eliot l pataki the states two previous governors paterson has indicated he wants to collect the taxes but has backed away from any attempt to go after the revenue still the governor has agreed to a budget for the current fiscal year that assumes the state will receive 120 million from such taxes just how remains uncertain
134002 the 2005 law which took effect march 1 2006 requires collecting the taxes at the wholesale level it directed the tax department to print coupons and distribute them to indians who are legally exempted from taxes on cigarettes but the department never sent out the coupons thereby rendering the law unenforceable

134004 the judicial branch just granted the executive branch the power to disregard an act of the legislative branch after its signed into law

134146 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
134147 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
134148 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
134149 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
134150 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
134151 they reacted swiftly calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
134152 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law

134362 weve taken the premise of relocating the oconnells from egypt and putting them in china which is as we all know another archaeologically rich nation a long time ago rob was a harvard major in archeology with a special interest in chinese studies so this was a passion piece for him
134363 we have an idea of what he does how he does it

134367 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
134368 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
134369 i forget the exact terminology but the comment was made in terms of her activities now seem to be that shes calmed down and shes in a relationship thats quieted her down and as such she seems to be attracting less attention and theres less activity that the paparazzi all of you are focusing on
134370 just for personal reasons and you know because its miley and theyre gonna do good were gonna do good too the audience is gonna vote so well see
134371 were not gonna see it until its live so i have no idea
134372 yeah i was surprised it got so big that we had to do it somewhere like this
134373 the tension is building up and people are getting nervous were gonna smoke the audience
134374 what do you expect i mean were real people i have nothing bad to say about anybody
134375 on december 1st of 1981 where were emmett and rosalie that night at dinner
134376 there was understandable disappointment among harry potter fans when only one copy of the tales of beedle the bard was offered to the public last december
134377 i am therefore delighted to announce that thanks to the generous support of bloomsbury scholastic and amazon and with the blessing of all the wonderful people who own the other six original books the tales of beedle the bard will now be widely available to all harry potter fans
134378 notes by professor albus dumbledore which appear by generous permission of the hogwarts headmasters archive
134379 dumbledores commentary on the tales which was discovered among his papers after his death includes some historical notes personal reminiscences and insights into that most mysterious branch of magic wandlore
134380 i very much hope that readers coming to these classic wizarding fables for the first time will find his commentary both entertaining and helpful

134421 given the worlds reliance on coal we need to find ways to make it a cleaner energy source were delighted to be working with our partners in china to help find solutions to this global challenge
134422 in a recent visit to china prime minister kevin rudd said that china was the largest consumer of coal in the world and australia was the worlds largest exporter of coal as such australia and china should work together develop low emissions coal technologies
134423 it will allow pcc technology to be progressed in the chinese energy sector which will have a much greater impact than operating in australia alone

134444 china has become a notable factor in the scientific landscape usually scientific development in nations does not show such a strong acceleration as we have seen in china so it will be interesting to see how it responds and develops in the future
134445 the same way as waste vapour is drawn out of this material to make hikers more comfortable to less prone to hypothermia so it is able to breathe oxygen into our fuel cell and into contact with the conductive plastic
134446 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
134447 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable
134448 the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
134449 the small amounts of carbon monoxide that are always present in exhausts from petrol engines are a real problem for fuel cells because the platinum catalyst is slowly poisoned eventually destroying the cell
134450 this growth model has never been experimentally observed because the whole reaction might be highly energetically unfavorable
134451 one of the most important approaches is the inner growth of swcnts which has been realized based on so called peapod structures
134452 the fullerene cages are incorporated in whole not in isolated carbon atoms and clusters besides this it is rather difficult to investigate the dynamical transformation process since this experiment is hard to monitor partially due to the short time scale for sw transformations in the range of nanoseconds or even faster
134453 by well controlling the supply of carbon feedstock through a thermally activated evaporation process we were able to observe the evolution of a growing swcnt with particular attention paid to the following question how does the cap of a carbon nanotube evolve during the growing process
134454 how does a carbon nanotube grow an in situ investigation on the cap evolution
134455 the cap of a swcnt is surprisingly found to be kept closed during the growing process because it was long believed that the cap should be open during the growth of swcnt
134456 the closed cap should be specific for non catalytic growth of swcnt we also found the cap shape evolves inhomogeneously with a few particular sites growing faster during the growth
134457 in our recent work in the case of catalyst free inner growth our results clearly indicate that swcnts prefer to grow with a closed cap especially for those with small diameters

134460 the smallest pore size is the key to the strength of porous materials and what they can do
134461 seeing inside bulk porous materials has never been done before at this resolution making this one of the first applications of x ray diffractive microscopy to a real problem
134462 three dimensional coherent x ray diffraction imaging of a ceramic nanofoam determination of structural deformation mechanisms
134463 the strength and stiffness of foam like structures are expected to scale with their density relating the density of individual elements like beams and nodes to the overall density
134464 but below about 10 percent density the strength of aerogels like the ones we tested on the order of 1 percent density is orders of magnitude less than expected
134465 the high resolution we achieved allowed us to see which of these models more accurately described the actual observed structure
134466 the structure was far more complex than anything wed seen in earlier images obtained using this technique
134467 wed like to use x ray diffraction to study a range of porous materials and nanostructures in general for example porous polymers developed at the molecular foundry for storing hydrogen as fuel and at even higher resolutions
134468 to do so david shapiro who built the end station we used for this work is working with us to overcome some obstacles
134469 and after all this you can find out the sample was no good so you have to start over
134470 we are also collaborating with berkeley labs computational research division to develop efficient and robust algorithms to speed up the time needed to construct the 3 d image from the individual rotated views
134471 this will open an entire spectrum of possibilities for new ways of seeing the very small not just aerogels but virtually any unknown object from nanostructures to biological cells

134546 as a freshman we used him as a forward last season as a sophomore we utilized his athleticism and converted him into a defensive central midfielder
134547 while he took some time to adjust and learn the position by the end of the season in my opinion he had become one of the best in his position in all of new england
134548 he has great size and strength which give him the versatility to play just about anywhere for us
134549 this season he will likely play in the midfield again for us and i expect him to be one of the most dominant players on the field in each game we play

134586 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
134587 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
134588 it is absolutely unavoidable that as hedging unwinds we will have to reflect the significant increase in the price of oil in our fares
134589 anything we raise from the fair is money we can use to spend on equipment
134590 we spend it on anything we didnt foresee in the budget
134591 we also continuously save money from the fair to make larger purchases
134592 the fire department association has participated in the purchase of trucks and safety equipment
134593 weve put approximately 80 000 into the truck that is going to be purchased next year
134594 the fire department has never considered itself two different associations
134595 you should not be jumping to conclusions about this case
134596 i guarantee this case is nothing like what has been reported so far
134597 she wants to resolve the charges that were brought against her as quickly as possible because she is innocent
134598 ladies in the past have had to do with small mens shirts
134599 the mens cut is boxier not flattering to the female form
134600 these are classic designs and people just love them i get to hear a good story every time someone buys them
134601 bob marley is going to put my kids through college
134602 you could put bob marley on a dead battery and it would sell
134603 sometimes it can be butterflies and blooms animals and lighthouses
134604 id have to say seashell decor is probably the no 1 category and its not just because we are at the beach you can tell its more of a trend
134605 the perception is theres a lot of land here fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it were down to 60 acres
134606 testing the waters a guide to water quality at vacation beaches
134607 the branding of hampton beach is that its a great beach and a whole lot more and that is exactly what it is and now everyone will know it
134608 i told my staff the other day the good news that we got this recognition i then told them the other news is that we have to work even harder to ensure that we retain our five star rating and that hampton beach continues to be one of the best beaches around
134609 its great to have a beach where people can come and recreate and enjoy beautiful clean water
134610 with all the stories you hear about beaches being closed for poor water quality down in massachusetts this news is fantastic
134611 hampton beach is one of the cleanest beaches right up there with laguna beach and ones in hawaii
134612 the day the ban was lifted we had an increase of 400 000 gallons
134613 i dont think we can count on that for august
134614 in five years now the sky has not fallen the earth has not opened to swallow us all up and more to the point thousands and thousands of good people contributing members of our society are able to make free decisions about their personal future and we ought to seek to affirm that every chance we can
134615 its extremely important if something happened to one of us shed always be taken care of
134616 now new yorkers can drive across the border to a neighboring state and get a marriage license that will be recognized as fully legal and valid here at home
134617 this is a clarion call for the rest of the nation on the dangers of this radical social experiment and also the essential need for a federal marriage amendment to clearly define marriage as the union of one man and one woman
134618 same sex marriage is a social experiment and it certainly will have an impact on the culture particularly the children where we already see that in massachusetts children are being educated on the efficacy of same sex marriage and the irrelevance of fatherhood and motherhood
134619 preservation is recycling on a large scale and we can reduce our impact on the environment and save energy by adaptively reusing buildings and their durable historic materials rather than carting them to the landfill
134620 let our hair down and have some fun prior to deployment
134621 this was a chance for them to relax a little but also get the families involved
134622 it has brought our family a little bit closer together
134623 shes the kind of lady that will help out some of the other wives
134624 but ive been trying to stay normal for him its hard but ive been trying
134625 its really nice because they offer so much to us and it helps just to know i have someone to call
134626 they are heading over with about 25 people from another unit
134627 they are going with the 128th air refueling wing out of wisconsin about a week or so ago they retuned from fort bliss in texas where they received training for our group this is the first time that any of them have been to afghanistan
134628 weve received a tremendous amount of interest from potential tenants
134629 i just want to make sure we have the right mix
134630 the guys got some work to do about the current state of the economy and the situation in iraq he shouldnt be on vacation
134631 depends its great that americans will be able to see him and be around him but the heightened security will make a few things difficult
134632 vacationers get excited to see their president and i think its great that people get to see air force one at the airport
134633 its a good thing because the president gets to spend some time with his family and enjoy whats around him
134634 the president will draw crowds and it will be good for business
134635 dogs arent allowed on this one hampton beach but wherever i can take her i let her go and play
134636 cigarette butts are a huge problem no way to argue that
134637 people consider them easy to throw down because they are small and likely seem harmless
134638 they are a huge problem and add up to enormous quantities of waste on public and private beaches
134639 the majority of people dont even associate it with trash
134640 cigarette smokers no matter where they are think that they can just flick it
134641 dogs arent allowed on this one hampton beach but wherever i can take her i let her go and play
134642 id say 99 5 percent of the people here are great
134643 i just met him yesterday but i told him id come back to say goodbye
134644 we planned this trip together but she didnt make it
134645 then i will come back here fix anything that needs fixing and replenish my supplies then im heading south providing there are no hurricanes heading up the east coast if there are im going down the st lawrence river
134646 i am going to be sending e mails to people to let them know about my trip
134647 by doing that it allowed me to get an unlimited license we didnt have radar back then no radios and thats when you had to be a real pilot you needed to know every rock and reef we had the last steam tug in the harbor
134648 its history a historic bridge of course in the winter you earn your money here
134649 when they rebuild the bridge in 2010 im coming back to watch
134650 i hope they ask eileen foley to cut the ribbon again
134651 ive seen so much change on this river mostly good sunrises and sunsets are spectacular here i see arctic fog where you cant even see the river
134652 i dont move unless i know i have a five day window
134653 i am a devout coward i have been in some truly dangerous conditions
134654 we lost the electricity an hour an a half before the storm hit
134655 all of a sudden it got real black and thunder and lightning
134656 as it was coming through it threw pine cones against the windows it sounded like a freight train the house tremored all of a sudden we heard a big bang within 30 seconds it was over
134657 if it had gone 50 feet further towards the lake we would have been wiped out
134658 my biggest accomplishment was the replacement of the box culvert on woodland road
134659 i thought that was a great accomplishment with four people
134660 i was hired in the old shed and ill retire in the old shed
134661 we can work so good together the hedge ill be mowing on one side shes on the other
134662 anything we raise from the fairs is money we can use to spend on equipment
134663 we spend it on anything we didnt foresee in the budget
134664 we also continuously save money from the fair to make larger purchases
134665 the fire department association has participated in the purchase of trucks and safety equipment
134666 weve put approximately 80 000 into the truck that is going to be purchased next year
134667 the fire department has never considered itself two different associations
134668 it takes a tremendous amount of money to run the fire department
134669 when verizon pulled out for whatever reason this private cell tower siting company said
134670 verizon has already contacted me about the status of this tower
134671 we just found out it is not up to ada standards
134672 i dont think we can wait to replace it until next year
134673 i want it to be cost effective but i want it to be functional
134674 were going to have to compromise with the higher price
134675 ive enjoyed my time here and ive been able to make a lot of accomplishments
134676 its time to move on to another direction and another chapter in life
134677 i think there was a certain pressure on him here and i wish him well
134678 i know he was trying hard to make it work its been very hard for him
134679 he had tough shoes to fill when skip sullivan left
134680 its tough to replace someone like that but he did it
134681 its with most of his information that well go forward
134682 its too bad he wont be here to see those buildings done
134683 obviously ive very much enjoyed working under the leadership of chief lipe
134684 testing the waters a guide to water quality at vacation beaches
134685 the very troubling granting of a treasury ofac license to a little league team to travel to cuba
134686 its added a large number to our population and also costs
134687 there is no medicare subsidy for somebody who is incarcerated
134688 we pay 100 percent of the bill as a result the prison system costs 50 billion per year to incarcerate people in the united states which is four times what it cost 20 years ago in the next five years it is projected to increase by 25 billion
134689 we have to forget about being tough or soft on crime we have to be smart on crime in the future because it costs too much money
134690 there are one million more beds across the country than 20 years ago yet the average length of stay has only extended by six months that equates to a lot of non violent low level offenders
134691 for a lot of years it was lock them up and throw away the key thats not going to make that person a better person when they come out and are your neighbor
134692 some welcome us with open arms as a system we have not done a good job of getting out there and talking to businesses so we are doing that better now
134693 every person released has a parole officer attached to them
134694 so if they are showing up late the business calls the parole officer its something a regular employee doesnt come with
134695 its not one size fits all in the court system anymore
134696 when we talk about crimes and new legislation comes through we have to think about the sentencing of that crime and what impact it might have on our system
134697 it went so smooth to me it was amazing ive never seen this type of work done before
134698 well have the actual connection of the steel sphere to water piping final work and ultimately demolition of the existing tank
134699 tales to go brings an interactive storytime filled with arts activities healthy snacks and free books of their very own for children to keep
134700 they are heading over with about 25 people from another unit
134701 they are going with the 128th air refueling wing they are out of wisconsin about a week or so ago they retuned from fort bliss in texas where they received training for our group this is the first time that any of them have been to afghanistan

134706 but ive been trying to stay normal for him its hard but ive been trying
134707 its really nice because they offer so much to us and it helps just to know i have someone to call
134708 tommy southwick will be a strong representative for the granite state college student body
134709 he is committed to bringing granite state colleges unique voice to the board tommy will work effectively with representatives from keene state college plymouth state university and the university of new hampshire in representing student interests i look forward to working with tommy over the next year in his capacity as a student leader
134710 while we have many family households that are tightening the spending watching their budget i feel the statehouse has been on a tax borrow and spending spree for the last two years
134711 thats a 17 percent increase of our money that we are paying in the form of new hampshire state taxes and fees and i find that unbelievable
134712 my understanding is that despite the criticism there is really no fat in the budget
134713 theres been a lot of complaining about the increase but i havent heard any constructive ideas of what could have been cut further that wasnt cut the current legislature went into office and faced a lot of outstanding problems including our retirement system and bridges and roads badly in need of repair i think there really was a responsible job by the current legislature and i would hope to continue to advance the progress
134714 so to say that the democratic legislature has gone overboard in spending is a great stretch of the truth because we havent done that and if one looks at the services that are expected by the population thats what we are trying to give especially in these times of stress these are just services that are expected
134715 if the government cant provide these services then theres no need for government and to provide these services taxes need to be what they are
134716 theyve nickeled and dimed everything they could find if you add all this up its a huge increase and burden on the people
134717 i believe that most parents care deeply about the emotional and physical health of their children and they should rightfully be included in these decisions
134718 those in the legislature that believe the state knows what is best i disagree with and i dont stand with them the house majority doesnt share the values i believe in and those in my community
134719 i think there is an undercurrent of democrats that really want to have an income or broad based sales tax and that is something i am against i think that is not going to solve problems it is going to create a whole different kind of state
134720 if you put a lot of money in a big pot of government they are going to spend it in order to maintain our way of life we have to be income and sales tax free we need government for certain things but i want to keep it limited to what we need it for
134721 seymour goes from a humble nerdy not very popular not lucky guy to being extremely popular having everything he wants and getting the girl
134722 it gives a message that what you have isnt nearly as bad as what you thought

134724 its an opportunity to see kids out of the school community and to see students in a way they can flourish

134726 i cant learn as well at home as when i am on stage and it just comes out
134727 shes very confined and then she reveals herself to someone once she finds out shes in love with them i think it is very romantic
134728 im generally not evil so its been a little difficult
134729 at the beginning i didnt know how i was going to do it but its fun to play someone whos evil when in other places its shunned upon
134730 you have to really throw yourself into it have to put personality into it you have to think about what you want to do and put it in there and not just making sure your voice is heard but your personality is heard
134731 i am looking forward to that good feeling when you are up on stage
134732 after we saw the police we looked around thinking maybe hed thrown his sweatshirt or the money over the fence but we didnt see anything

134735 ive enjoyed my time here and ive been able to make a lot of accomplishments
134736 its time to move on to another direction and another chapter in life

134739 he had tough shoes to fill when skip sullivan left

134757 disgust based and fear based campaigns are more likely to be forwarded by male recipients than female recipients
134758 lost in the rocky remote australian outback a former pest exterminator faced dehydration and death desperate for food he turned to what he knew best bugs he said wednesday theo rosmulder 52 managed to survive for four days by feasting on termites and other insects before local aborigines happened upon him tuesday and brought him back to civilization
134759 in this article we identify that successful viral marketing campaigns trigger an emotional response in recipients working under this premise we examine the effects of viral messages containing the six primary emotions surprise joy sadness anger fear and disgust on recipients emotional responses to viral marketing campaigns and subsequent forwarding behavior according to our findings in order to be effective viral messages need to contain the element of surprise by itself however surprise is not enough to guarantee message success therefore it must be combined with other emotions the effectiveness of the viral message is also moderated by gender with disgust based and fear based campaigns being more likely to be forwarded by male recipients than female recipients to ensure forwarding behavior the message must capture the imagination of the recipient as well as be clearly targeted moreover achieving fit between a campaign and the featured emotions is important as this ensures an increased chance of forwarding in addition to relaying these and other findings we share and discuss the managerial implications of using different emotions in viral marketing campaigns finally culture is recognized as an influencer
134760 the literature still does not empirically identify the impact if any of gender on referral behavior our findings contributed on this important topic by identifying empirically the impact of gender on referral behavior
134761 six primary emotions surprise joy sadness anger fear and disgust
134762 all my business contacts literally threw away my business card

134764 we welcome the commissions report on the election and will continue our fruitful relationship in working with them on the 2012 election
134765 it is essential that the public can have confidence in all aspects of the electoral process and we still have significant concerns about the use of electronic counting for elections in the uk
134766 we continue to press the government for a national strategy on the use of electronic counting and we also want to see the greater london returning officer carry out a comparison of the costs and benefits of both electronic and manual options for counting ballot papers before the next gla elections in 2012
134767 we know that many patients choose not to complete their course of medication but this study reveals a different type of problem patients who for whatever reason take their medicines incorrectly
134768 our pharmacists have reported many instances where patients have been confused by their medicines
134769 one patient set out a range of medicines and described the frequency and dosage for each
134770 it turns out that for several months she had been taking a sleeping pill first thing in the morning
134771 when the pharmacist asked him to demonstrate the problem became clear he wasnt removing the cap
134772 contemporary medievalism is now tarred by the same brush that in conservative circles continues to dismiss cultural studies as mere chat about television cinema and the internet that is the accusation that there is too much pleasure too little work in its study
134773 who thus emerges as capable of both forgetting and remembering the past
134774 imagine if tomorrow you could announce a new energy plan that would in one stroke cut your constituents gasoline bill in half reduce our oil imports improve our air quality enhance national security strengthen the dollar reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create tens of thousands of new jobs in the u s
134775 i believe your upcoming reelection chances would be even higher than they already are
134776 we are concerned that adding new uses to natural gas such as in transportation will create new and relatively inelastic demand that we cannot meet without high prices
134777 there will be a huge incentive for utilities that generate electricity from coal to convert to natural gas
134778 thats going to increase the demand for natural gas and put pressure on prices
134779 i think there will be plenty of supply to meet the demand from our and all the other industries

134784 there have always been assumptions that a hotspot has always been there and it is an area that produces its own diversity
134785 temperature is certainly facilitating diversity but if it was only temperature in the eocene you would have really high diversity in modern africa
134786 we realised these are distinct locations where you have major complex collisions between continents
134787 the issue of reducing our energy dependence and greenhouse gas emissions is so challenging and so important that we have to follow this judicial pathway
134788 the epa should have been regulating these emissions a long time ago and its just been sitting around

134794 the whole industry has been doing really quite well but it has grown so fast over the last couple of years that returns are starting to drop pretty sharply
134795 all of a sudden therell just be too many blueberries one year and they wont be worth anything
134796 weve had the best of both worlds increasing supply and increasing pricing really driven by the whole health interest in blueberries
134797 we have to continue to keep supply and demand in balance for the blueberry growers
134798 a lot of people who traditionally buy from growers theyre not committing and its creating a lot of uncertainty in the market
134799 this industry was due for a tremendous growing pain and i think this year is the first year of the effects of that its due to the success of the crop farmers do jump on each others bandwagons when theres a successful crop
134800 how long it will last will depend on whether the average consumer can continue to afford our crop

134809 a gas explosion killed at least 15 students and injured more than 25 others wrecking a dormitory at a girls school on friday
134810 there may still be 10 15 students under the rubble
134811 i was in the uncollapsed part of the building with five of my friends immediately after the explosion and we felt flames rising from the downstairs to upper floors
134812 before the explosion i heard one of our teachers saying that a gas hose was not attached to its proper place in the kitchen
134813 we think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building given the burns on the injured
134814 some girls told the local authorities they smelt gas odour in the dorm and one girl said the blast had occurred just after one of their fellow students turned on the switch light

135017 households now have to spend more on their mortgage repayments and council tax bills combined with the fact that their real earnings are failing to keep up with inflation and so they are feeling poorer and having to cut back in some areas of spending
135018 the credit crunch has been a harrowing experience for most pension schemes in terms of volatility but as we approach the anniversary of when the uk market started to feel its affects most schemes have survived relatively unscathed

135028 the australian government has formed the view that the safeguards agreement is a positive step which will strengthen nuclear non proliferation efforts and is consistent with the non proliferation objectives of the nuclear non proliferation treaty
135029 it has no effect nor does it require a change to the australian labor partys long standing approach of not exporting uranium to a country thats not a party to the npt
135030 if we were to change our policy approach on uranium it would seriously undermine the nuclear non proliferation treaty we want that treaty to be enhanced
135031 well take a positive and constructive approach and we will certainly have non proliferation considerations uppermost in mind
135032 but we will also take into account the strategic importance of the arrangement to both india and the united states
135033 its a totally different game than what weve played over the last how many years
135034 certainly were learning about these laws just like the players are and so i think thats the circumstances that youre looking at and thats why youve got quite a bit of change in policy as you go on as you get used to these laws and adjust to them
135035 the players have been playing with them from the start so if they hadnt been exposed to them that would be probably more of an issue
135036 to be honest they probably profited from them more than we did in the first encounter
135037 weve talked to the players about various policies playing under these elvs
135038 i guess until you really face the challenge and you come up short that you really have to think deeply about whats going on there
135039 i watch a bit of rugby on video and try and analyse the game and spend a lot of time doing that and so do the other two guys assistant coaches
135040 we thought we had done that pretty well but until you get into the heat of the battle i guess thats the big learning experience

135056 ive never competed in the epic before and ill only be turning up the day before the first race so im going in blind
135057 the last couple of weeks have been terrible so this week being the game that it is im looking to rectify that
135058 id love to go on but i havent even sat down with knighter coach matthew knights yet
135059 its something well probably do at the end of the year
135060 weve been a few troops down through injury so ive probably snuck in a few games i shouldnt have got
135061 its something that ive been very passionate about and something that i will continue to be passionate about
135062 the response that weve got from the victorian public last year and now from the national public this year has been phenomenal
135063 this player has entered into an agreement we werent aware of it and unfortunately we got fined

135100 our findings indicate that the initial hospital costs associated with penetrating trauma are substantial and vary to a considerable degree by patient injury and treatment characteristics
135101 although the costs of penetrating trauma resulting from shooting are higher than from stabbing the most commonly used weapon in violent crime in england and wales is actually a knife
135102 at an average cost of 7 699 per penetrating injury from alleged assault and a total of 417 injuries per year requiring hospitalisation for at least three days the total acute care cost of this type of injury alone may exceed 3 2 million annually
135103 public health initiatives that aim to reduce the incidence and severity of penetrating trauma are therefore likely to produce significant savings in acute trauma care costs
135104 considering the additional medical costs of rehabilitation and broader costs to society resulting from lost productivity permanent disability premature death and the pain and suffering of the victims and their families there is a compelling argument for money to be better spent on prevention strategies that reduce violent incidents
135105 it should be borne in mind that most of the cost of trauma especially stabbing is not to the health service but in billions per annum to the taxpayer through legal costs loss of productive tax paying years in those that die or are severely disabled and in long term care
135106 the collection of national injury data to allow this type of analysis has increased in importance following lord darzis recent emphasis on the reorganisation of trauma care in the uk we hope that in future all uk hospitals will record this information

135131 im currently packing up real quick to hop on a plane to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let you all know first that there is no chance of me competing in beijing
135132 the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything
135133 after wednesdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
135134 after taking a few different exams and mris the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
135135 there are so many mixed feelings because on wednesday night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
135136 but after thursday mornings tests for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem
135137 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal it really hurts me to say i have to miss the olympics
135138 it has been a dream of mine ever since i was a little girl
135139 one of the things im really looking forward to is the opening ceremony and walking with athletes from my country in front of thousands of people
135140 lack of time prevented us from being able to address the outstanding concerns of one delegation
135141 no position has been taken by the security council on the question of whether to take any action in the light of the moreno ocampo proposal to indict president beshir
135142 the united states abstained in the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president beshir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
135143 i want to give high marks to the british delegation
135144 they discussed in good faith with everybody they were very cooperative they tried to accommodate the concerns of major parties

135151 im going there to gratify myself by playing and to show off what the music hall has in the way of an organ
135152 we dont print exactly whats being played we announce it we talk in between the songs make little jokes otherwise it gets kind of boring watching the back of somebody

135156 lets see what can we use to convince people that christianity is true do we have eyewitnesses or something we can claim to be eyewitness testimony do we have anything we can cite as being multiple independent eyewitness sources can we argue for the trustworthiness of the eyewitnesses is there anything from archeology or ancient literature that we can use as evidence can we make it sound like the writers are being embarrassingly forthright and honest in their accounts what can we use to convince people were right
135157 do they testify about things that are consistent with what we observe in the real world
135158 do we have corroborating evidence from archeology or other writers
135159 does the testimony contain events or details that are embarrassing to the authors

135180 er ist eine richtige verst rkung f r uns er ist schnell und machte uns deshalb in der vergangenheit oft probleme
135181 es w re grandios wenn wir uns wieder auf den vierten platz zur ck k mpfen und auch dort bleiben k nnten
135182 das ist eine gro e forderung sie ist aber nicht unm glich es trennt uns nur ein punkt davon dazu m ssen wir mit beiden autos punkten denn timo glock ist nicht zu untersch tzen wenn er einen guten tag hat und nelson piquet junior hat gerade erst acht punkte geholt
135183 wenn wir das schaffen k nnen wir auch wieder auf den vierten platz vorr cken aber das ist viel einfacher gesagt als getan
135184 theyre a younger team with a lot of energy hopefully we can play well and its good series should be a lot of fun
135185 they have a mix of young guys and old guys
135186 nobody wouldve picked them to contend in their division i think that year in 2006 a lot of people were probably picking the indians or the white sox people thought the tigers were a good team in 06 obviously but we hadnt done it we kind of had that chip on our shoulders as underdogs
135187 a lot of times that really drives a team if they go to places and other people expect them to not win a lot of times that lights fires under guys and brings the best out of them
135188 im not happy at all with some of the missed opportunities and the way weve played defensively
135189 they had a pretty good idea about the middle of the game today
135190 it wasnt intentional i was excited it was a big spot for us

135196 sto attenta a non compiacermene pi alto il gradimento pi si pu deludere pi basso pi si pu stupire
135197 ammetto che quando fini mi volle vicepresidente della camera due anni fa alla mia prima legislatura fu un bellimpatto per tutti per me ma anche per tanti colleghi di an che si sono visti scavalcare da una giovanissima senza esperienza
135198 lusingata ma il mio nome gira spesso su tutte le ruote pi per posizionamenti interni che per altro
135199 guardi lo schema un po diverso fini divenne leader del movimento giovanile su indicazione di almirante io sono stata eletta dopo aver vinto un congresso per pochi voti a me nessuno ha regalato niente
135200 ho naturalmente un ottimo rapporto con il presidente fini che mi ha dato questaltra opportunit ma credo di non aver sfigurato nel lavoro alla camera e ho molte idee per il mio ministero
135201 rivoluzione del merito contro il modello egualitarista ereditato dal sessantotto le intelligenze esistono e vanno valorizzate
135202 s vero lho preso in prestito ma io non ho schematismi ascolto guccini e se mi piace un titolo della sinistra lo uso
135203 in questo caso voglio raccontare storie edificanti dei nostri ragazzi non ci sono solo gli episodi di bullismo ma milioni di storie di impegno civile sociale religioso vorrei diffonderle in televisione e nei siti internet non bisogna mostrare solo gli aspetti degenerativi
135204 conosco le obiezioni ma sono convinta che se i giovani si vedono rappresentati sempre al peggio si convincono di esserlo
135205 se ieri erano rivoluzionarie le idee oggi rivoluzionario il modo in cui le idee vengono comunicate e comunicano tra di loro
135206 macch sono proprio cos sono gelosa della mia normalit e far aspettare gli autisti mi mette ansia questa delle auto blu una cosa che piace ai giornalisti come il fatto che sono della garbatella
135207 e vero ma il sogno dei media italiani quello di vedermi recitare nella fiction i cesaroni fa molto personaggio tipico e poi la garbatella non mica un quartiere strano un posto bellissimo dove abito felicemente da quando avevo tre anni
135208 alla camilluccia una zona borghese e meno bella ma poi io e mia sorella abbiamo dato fuoco alla casa e ci siamo dovute trasferire
135209 beh stavamo giocando con dei fiammiferi non labbiamo mica fatto apposta
135210 non so niente credo mi ci sta facendo pensare lei per la prima volta forse ci sono delle cose che ci portiamo dentro inconsciamente ma comunque io sono del capricorno e tendo molto a razionalizzare
135211 per mia madre stata dura ancora oggi sussulta soltanto se mi accendo una sigaretta c da capirla sola con due bambine piccole
135212 potrebbe essere accaduto e potrebbe aver trovato la porta chiusa considero una violenza trovarmi a 30 anni con una persona seduta davanti a me che dice di essere mio padre
135213 non sarebbe questo il punto non ho mai parlato di politica con lui ma pur di cucirmi addosso un romanzo sono arrivati a dire che la mia scelta di destra sarebbe una reazione allabbandono
135214 no a quindici anni ho assistito con occhi da bambina alla strage di capaci e allomicidio di borsellino ho pensato di dover fare qualcosa e sono andata a curiosare in un collettivo di sinistra della mia scuola esperienza pessima
135215 gi ma io volevo interloquire partecipare mica ascoltare passivamente invece erano arroganti chiusi conformisti una vera casta e ho cercato altrove
135216 scherza spero un sospetto del genere mi terrorizza tutta la mia vita politica una lotta ai privilegi alla fine si vedr se nel mio piccolo sono riuscita a cambiare qualcosa o se il sistema ha cambiato me questa la sfida
135217 difendo con i denti la mia intimit presente e passata finora andata bene
135218 mi sono divertita anche perch mi aveva avvertito te ne ho combinata una paola ha gusti sessuali diversi dai miei ma una gran bella persona ha anche difeso la carfagna
135219 e vero mi batte in velocit ma ora l e deve essere giudicata per quello che fa come ministro della repubblica considerare che debba il suo posto a favori sessuali una discriminazione antifemminile ne sono sicura perch lo hanno detto anche di me mi ci vede
135220 sto a mio agio cos anche perch quando provo a vestirmi come le altre faccio figuracce per il giuramento dei ministri avevo speso un sacco di soldi per un tailleur firmato e hanno scritto che facevo simpatia perch ero vestita da bancarella

135244 i guess the way to say it is it was less bad than the market was anticipating and in this market less bad is enough to send your stock price up
135245 we will start the campaign programme this weekend anwar is heading to penang to launch it
135246 nothing is going to stop anwars return to politics unless the ruling government cheats with the use of phantom voters and vote buying
135247 wants to seek justice in a court of law we cannot ignore him everyone has the right to seek justice
135248 i think they may act against him but we hope the authorities will act in a fair and just manner and do not arrest him
135249 we have to be realistic it will be tough we will do our best
135250 its another year in which ill have to challenge myself and make sure im in the team
135251 im really pleased to get rangi he is very quick has good skills is a hard worker and a strong defender
135252 we intend to be strong in the pivotal positions next year and while we see rangi playing primarily in the halves he can also do a job at hooker
135253 it is really disappointing but what i wanted to do and what i know are right are two different things
135254 im doing the right one by going in for the operation now
135255 i also know i wouldnt have been able to play to my best or do myself justice if id have carried on and this way ill be fully fit for 2009
135256 he wants to do that too but we both realise what is right for him in this situation and with regards his long term future
135257 i would also like to make it clear that this shoulder injury isnt the one sams been playing on with for the last few months that was in his other shoulder and has been a simple problem
135258 i am really sorry to hear about sams injury and i feel for him now that hes lost the opportunity to win a place in the england world cup squad
135259 we had small attendance for both meets and many of them were younger swimmers
135260 i was very impressed with all the swimmers that attended and especially so with the ones who attended both meets the meets are long and tiring especially for young swimmers and even more when they have two in the same weekend
135261 all the swimmers that attended swam best times for the most part
135262 rhianna has really improved a lot last year she had a rough time swimming best times but this year she has been getting best times almost every meet
135263 he may not have every stroke down to a t but he shows more energy than ive seen and has great potential
135264 im glad to see shes having fun and is so happy and excited after she swims
135265 she listens very well to everything we coaches say and is having a great year
135266 had a great meet improving in all his strokes and times ive seen a ton of progress from him since the start of the season
135267 competed in his first meet with the fly and breast and did very well
135268 the members of the ponhook club are grateful that the trust has agreed to take ownership of this land we have spent countless hours fishing along the banks of this beautiful river and we are thrilled that it will be protected in its wild state forever

135277 i wanted this last import defensive slot to be taken by a very very mobile player who can clock up the minutes on the ice
135278 i am thrilled to be suiting up for the blaze this coming season
135279 i feel extremely fortunate to have the opportunity to be a part of a top flight organization with a proven record of success such as the coventry blaze
135280 the choice to come to coventry was a no brainer for me from everything ive heard coventry is one of the most amazing hockey environments to play in
135281 this will be a unique opportunity for me to grow as a hockey player as well as giving me the opportunity to expand my horizons by experiencing a new culture
135282 hes going after miss dawes that makes dent our job
135283 in the sector of oil we can continue with the mission of transmitting to the brother countries what we could grasp and learn from others that had more experience

135294 nachdem sich schon die hoffnungen auf eine verbesserung der menschenrechte in china im vorfeld der spiele zerschlagen haben zeigt sich nun dass auch die zusicherung der pressefreiheit nicht ernst gemeint war
135295 das vorgehen des olympischen organisationskomitees und des ioc ist ein weiterer tiefschlag f r die menschenrechte und f r die olympische idee
135296 china hat durch die pressezensur abermals die olympische norm verfehlt
135297 wie sollen die spiele denn eine verbesserung der menschenrechtslage bringen wenn das ioc selbst w hrend der spiele die werkzeuge des totalitarismus blind akzeptiert
135298 what this research reveals is that companies of all sizes are engaging in and benefiting from collaboration with other organisations either locally or in countries where they may have no direct presence whatsoever
135299 what is striking is that a significant minority of these companies acknowledge that they couldnt even exist if it wasnt for the collaborative relationships they have engaged in

135320 its a worrying trend thats not going to slow down yet fortunately most subscribers are not infected as viruses are still immature and of limited virulence but those who do get infected can lose up to 100 eur a day from the mms being sent by the virus these are typically corporate users with the latest phones and who do not scrutinize their bills

135324 xa manifestaron a s a adhesi n a esta iniciativa de defensa do transporte p blico
135325 me ha alegrado mucho la vuelta de la misa en lat n
135326 la comisi n de coordinaci n del coi y bocog se reuni ayer por la noche y estuvo de acuerdo el uso de internet ser igual que en cualquiera de los juegos ol mpicos
135327 me ha alegrado mucho la vuelta de la misa en lat n
135328 no s lo es pionero en espa a sino que representa el ejemplo m s evidente de c mo afronta la crisis del sector
135329 esta iniciativa traslada un mensaje de confianza en el sector se ha consensuado con todas las partes implicadas y va a permitir que los ciudadanos tengan acceso a pisos m s baratos y a financiaci n suficiente para comprarlos
135330 que adem s de fijar el precio del metro cuadrado en los 3 000 euros una cantidad muy elevada teniendo en cuenta que se trata de vivienda protegida est limitado a los ciudadanos que tuvieran unos ingresos m ximos de 6 5 veces el iprem
135331 subi artificialmente el precio de la vivienda protegida para igualarla al precio de la libre una decisi n que es intervencionista e insolidaria y que no soluciona los problemas del sector ni el acceso de los ciudadanos a la vivienda
135332 ha conseguido que sean los promotores privados los que rebajen el precio de las viviendas libres que no venden sin coste alguno para las arcas del gobierno regional ya que no son viviendas protegidas y aporta transparencia al mercado ya que los ciudadanos van a saber en todo momento qu compran y a qu precio
135333 la comunidad de madrid contribuye al ajuste del mercado pero no lo suplanta ni lo sustituye como suelen proponer los socialistas con propuestas tan arbitrarias e ineficaces como la compra de suelo a los promotores
135334 d lecciones al gobierno regional de c mo afrontar el problema de la vivienda en la regi n

135341 im willing and ready to admit that im in pain every day its pretty terrible to be honest with you
135342 but i am here i am speaking with you im very fortunate and there are some that arent as fortunate as i and others that had no fortune that day
135343 its the type of thing we spend our careers trying to make sure does not occur
135344 that is not something you would want to leave to somebody else to have to pick up
135345 the bridge did collapse while i was the state bridge engineer so i feel i need to deal with it
135346 daily we spend time dealing with the aftermath of i 35w im not complaining
135347 im not going to tell you that weve never seen a political investigation here before
135348 but this one did have a good deal of political interest and outcry why this was a very highly visible event of incredible magnitude bridges dont fall in the united states its rare that they do very rare
135349 but we do not engage in politics we are not influenced by politics
135350 we are not protecting the governors butt any longer this has got to be done
135351 you can only fiddle with this stuff so long people dont like increases in taxes i dont but i dont know how else to pay for that
135352 rattled by folding specialty divisions economic woes and the challenge of keeping films in theaters a climate of risk aversion not seen since the death of auteur driven films in the 1970s has set in
135353 in perhaps the most impressive footage serried ranks of performers dressed in huge boxes rise and fall in what appears to be a visualization of the continuous building of skyscraper blocks that is chinas current cultural master achievement
135354 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
135355 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
135356 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
135357 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
135358 because it is undisputed that house bill 79 was not presented to the governor until april 16 after the legislatures power to conduct legislative business had terminated this court holds that provisions of house bill 79 are null and void
135359 we look forward to briefing this issue and believe that the judge will see the error of his finding upon reading of our briefs
135360 it is a longstanding practice for governors to accept and act upon bills presented to them on the day after adjournment
135361 if judge shepherds ruling stands as is it could lead to a myriad of litigation not desired by the legislative or executive branches
135362 pleased that the court has found that the words of the constitution mean what they say that the legislature cant stop the clock and continue working after the april 15 deadline
135363 the governors determination to spend money without legislative approval is the critical question in this lawsuit
135364 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
135365 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
135366 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
135367 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
135368 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
135369 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
135370 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
135371 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
135372 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
135373 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november

135376 nat rlich sind wir dabei wenn sich die firmen der bayerischen hauptstadt bei einer solchen veranstaltung zusammenfinden und letztlich geballte wirtschaftliche und l uferische kraft repr sentieren

135392 if its not saturday but next week well not make a big fuss about it what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the very coming days
135393 we are continuing our double approach of dialogue and pressure if dialogue does not work we could continue with additional pressure at the u n or eu level
135394 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
135395 afghanistan under coalition watch has practically become a narco state
135396 we leave it to the people of permatang pauh to decide
135397 i think we have to be realistic its going to be a tough constituency but we have to do our best
135398 the authorities will enforce the law if there is a case against him
135399 no the government is not threatened we have enough majority
135400 it is very refreshing for zimbabweans to hear the negotiators saying the process is going on very well especially when it comes from the opposition and it comes from morgan tsvangirai himself it is good to hear that but again it is too early for ordinary zimbabweans to celebrate because as you know that there is a media blackout and we dont know exactly what they are discussing and if they are saying they are proceeding very well we dont know what is well but with tsvangirai we would have to hope that they mean well for the people of zimbabwe
135401 i dont think that if tsvangirai is saying the talks are going very well and they mean that mugabe will remain the helm of government mugabe remains the state president i dont think i will describe that as well because as long as you have mugabe in the leadership in whatever position but still the head there is no well in the talks because i dont think that is what the zimbabweans want
135402 zimbabweans want a new set of leadership even if it is transitional i dont think they now need a name called mugabe
135403 that is a very good move by the opposition when the talks started we said we were very skeptical about mugabes intentions we believed that he was only asking the opposition and the opposition asking zanu pf to come up with its lists of demands and the proposal that came from zanu pf shows that mugabes intention was to swallow the opposition and surely we cannot be creating vice presidents anytime there is a crisis and when there are negotiations we solve that by creating vice presidents
135404 the akp had been convicted for committing a crime against secularism by the 10 of the 11 members of the constitutional court
135405 so that the akp was not acquitted by the constitutional court

135411 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has
135412 in fact he has done more than we could have hoped for
135413 i think probably some have nuanced their positions the conversation continues we are continuing to engage

135440 although the risk management programme seems to have picked them up quickly which is good the impact on neurologist take up puts our forecasts at serious risk
135441 the hope of some scientists is that they might be able to harness stem cells and program them to generate pluripotent stem cell lines capable of differentiating into many different types of cells which have the genes of patients
135442 this would open up the possibility of producing a large supply of immune matched cells to that patient that could be used in transplantation methodologies
135443 the other hope and one thats much closer upon us is if you could produce the cell types that become sick in that person you might be able to use them in the laboratory to come to understand basic aspects of the disease and take the study of disease out of patients where its very difficult and put it into the petri dish
135444 we dont at all fully understand als and it is our lack of understanding of that disease process which we believe is preventing us from developing more effective treatments
135445 because the disease process is happening in the spinal cord in the central nervous system of patients we dont at all have access to living examples of the neurons that are undergoing the disease process no way could we go to als patients and take samples of their motor neurons
135446 a well made blog about a fascinating subject very much useful information and lots of links to more in depth information and resources the only thing im not to happy about is all the ideas my girlfriend got from the site
135447 you would definitely do great if you marketed this service i love your blog very niche oriented and a pleasant read keep up the good work
135448 significant step forward in the development of an effective alzheimers therapy
135449 however we recognise that without further supportive data on bapineuzumab the shares are unlikely
135450 but in our view the magnitude of the cognitive benefits in small numbers of patients on top of existing therapies together with the safety data is compelling
135451 despite the new concerns over the strength of the phase ii data and the lack of efficacy in apoe4 carrier patients we believe that as the drug would appear to provide benefit to at least the apoe4 non carrier subset of patients and the phase iii trial has been designed to pick up that feature the market is undervaluing the drug

135454 today women are not only the most powerful consumers in the world were also the power users of web 2 0 and social media technologies
135455 online media is taking away from traditional media and blogging is a new medium just like mobile is a new medium mommy blogging is one of the biggest and most influential sectors
135456 these women are changing the nature of advertising in this space advertisers need to treat these women intelligently and speak to them differently
135457 in this medium women are creating their own terms in their own voice
135458 im here because i want to meet more of the mommy bloggers its important for us to get to know this particular audience as well as other bloggers out there
135459 today we are seeing a change in how people communicate they want their voices heard sure they listen to the message but today they say hey heres our take on this bloggers want to have a say and we run a big risk not talking to them
135460 with so many people paying attention to what we are saying there is a tendency for some to write things they think will be commercially acceptable
135461 as long as you are honest if you love the product or tv show i want to hear you i dont write with the intention of making money but if anyone wants to give it to me i will take it but you are not going to censor me
135462 if i want to curse or say something politically incorrect i am going to say it
135463 i make enough to pay for quite a nice lunch once a month
135464 we live as comfortably as we did when jon worked full time and i was at home
135465 this blogging has become so much about advertising and money and you are either being courted by the advertisers or you are not

135484 you cannot ignore the fact that they take in 20 000 animals a year you cant adopt your way out of that problem
135485 initially it will be a cornelius facility but it is anticipated that surrounding jurisdictions at some point will join that is the hope
135486 we have a great deal of respect for their work and their focus on behalf of animals
135487 we will continue to watch their efforts and measure our needs as compared to needs as compared to what they have to offer
135488 i cant speak for the prime minister but i presume this will be raised
135489 there are so many power centres in pakistan it is difficult to deal with the situation surely the issue will be raised
135490 we are unhappy with the role isi pakistans inter services intelligence is playing
135491 we have the cleanest evidences that is why we went public and said pakistans isi is behind this it is not just us even the us and other countries are openly saying so that the isi is responsible
135492 the message of kabul was very clear get out of afghanistan
135493 while the ahmedabad and jaipur blasts were similar in bangalore there was a great deal of sophistication
135494 we have some leads but we are not clear about the message behind the attack
135495 definitely the attacks reflect that the capacity of the terrorists has grown
135496 a top government scientist who helped the fbi analyze samples from the 2001 anthrax attacks has died in maryland from an apparent suicide just as the justice department was about to file criminal charges against him for the attacks

135505 im sorry but theres just no other way to put it mccains campaign is still foundering sinking slowly beneath the waves as the good ship
135506 his latest most personal assault on barack obama is further proof that the so called maverick has trashed his own promise of high minded discourse and instead embraced the gut kicking bush political template of the past eight years indeed you dont have to be an obama fan to conclude that the latest assault is juvenile i say this because a fair number of republicans some speaking anonymously to the press with others including former mccain aides speaking on the record have already judged the assault to be juvenile or as ex mccain intimate john weaver prefers to call it childish

135510 the case is nowhere near as compelling as it was earlier this year
135511 ideally you dont want to use stimulus measures but they may be your only option if monetary policy isnt very effective
135512 fiscally a second package could make sense if we knew it was going to be a long recession until say the middle of 2009
135513 no one knows the answer to that today while lawmakers are debating its possible the recession ends on its own or continues for another year
135514 you want it hitting before the recovery begins the point of doing something is to create a recovery once a recovery starts you dont want stimulus because its a waste of money and could be inflationary youd be stepping on the gas too hard
135515 when you start to see them move up then were in a recovery
135516 policymakers in office today should design it if needed when the next president is in office
135517 in early 2009 well have a better sense of what the backside of the first stimulus package looks like and well have a better sense of where we are in the housing downturn
135518 traditionally government deficit spending is supposed to help the economy
135519 if thats not enough stimulus we have to look elsewhere

135546 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
135547 presumably a la harold ford 2006 this will be one of those strategies that will be a matter of deep dispute during the campaign and later treated as transparent and obvious once the campaign is concluded
135548 the mccain campaign is now pushing the caricature of obama as a uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women

135560 we gave the first video camera out in hebron in january 2007
135561 the largest number are in the hebron region where the most frequent complaints of settler attacks are and recently in the northern area and the region next to the building of the separation wall where there are demonstrations
135562 the project started as response to the need to gather evidence we were constantly filing complaints to no avail on the basis of lack of evidence or we dont know the name of the settler
135563 now we are going back and forth with our video cassettes to israeli police station begging them to press rewind freeze it is the bulk of our work the value of the footage is not only evidential it also has had a remarkable value in terms of advocacy and campaigning
135564 there was a conspiracy of silence surrounding settler violence in particular this footage is shocking to israelis
135565 they had rounded up the foreigners from the international solidarity movement and arrested me and another guy separately they put me in a jeep and started cursing me hitting me and using bad language in hebrew and arabic it had never occurred to me that they would shoot
135566 they held me in the sun for a long time later i heard them discussing what they were going to do with me i recall hearing a conversation about how to shoot me what i recall is the words rubber bullet rubber bullet i was blindfolded so i was only aware of their aggression
135567 it was only when i saw salams video that i understood what happened to me the guy touching me on my right shoulder before i was shot just before it happened they said theyre going to beat me they said they were going to send me to hell they know me because ive been to every protest
135568 when i asked for medical attention they said this is nothing we are going to beat you more
135569 these events that happen are often so distant or happen in the middle of the night where there is no media
135570 where weve seen there is a lot of violation from the settlers and especially where there are demonstrations happening and we want to monitor the israeli soldiers behaviour we are distributing video cameras
135571 it is having a good effect and it will stop the violations
135572 we want to encourage a mentality to use the cameras it is the only weapon that the civilians have
135573 in the beginning we were almost begging people to take the cameras with them when they went out they didnt see the use of it but after the media coverage over the susya incident weve gotten a flood of requests for our video cameras and those who have got the cameras are using them much more frequently
135574 it is one of the biggest victories because it is the troops not the settlers
135575 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

135613 its difficult for people outside sometimes to understand in a small place you are particularly aware of the need to behave properly
135614 to behave appropriately to have the integrity to take decisions that need to be taken its no good trying to drawn up a code of practice for everything because the circumstances are too wide
135615 but one does have to be aware of these positions and as far as im concerned personally it is sometimes the case that i have had to consider the prosecution of politicians of ministers and ive done that
135616 and as attorney general i have an independent appointment which certainly gives me the comfort of knowing i can take those decisions fearlessly and to the extent that they come to be taken in this case i intend to do that
135617 the truth of the matter is that weve delivering justice on this island for centuries and i dont see that this is going to make any difference to it
135618 i know on behalf of the careleavers they would like lenny to stay on but as far we we know he hasnt even been asked if hed like to stay on
135619 when he goes we think it will all be swept under the carpet basically
135620 what has made this one significantly different from my perception and from any similar enquiries of this nature that ive been involved in before is the political hostility that it has engendered from amongst politicians who one would normally think would be crawling over themselves to offer support to the inquiry and the victims
135621 and with a very few notable exceptions that hasnt happened here

135649 frankly in darfur today there is not a real peace agreement
135650 we do not have the kind of capacity that is needed to make a real difference
135651 one of the major problems theyve had is that darfur is such a large region and the conflict has really spread throughout most of that and into chad as well the neighbouring country
135652 and their numbers and their mobility do not allow them to supervise and ensure peace throughout the whole region
135653 and the mobility of the attackers the so called janjaweed allows them to hit and run in many parts of darfur where the peacekeepers are not stationed as the peacekeepers move the janjaweed move accordingly
135654 so its been very difficult for them to maintain peace and order throughout the entire region but they certainly have brought some stability to some parts
135655 for it to be resolved in a way that ensures a lasting peace and one that is acceptable to the majority of people in darfur and the rest of sudan there really needs to be a national reconciliation
135656 one that takes into account the grievances of people in the west that restores some sense of national government and takes into account some of the issues that the north south agreement the comprehensive peace agreement has addressed such as wealth distribution and power and decentralisation of power
135657 information of this attack was shared very late with pakistan this was a case where the u s did not want to alert the pakistanis in advance because of concerns over information leaks
135658 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
135659 what the u s wants is a revamp especially among the isis units which deal with areas along the afghan border additionally the u s wants to see new structures in place for closer oversight on people in the field basically within the isi there has to be a strong internal affairs unit of a kind
135660 is failing the militants are gaining ground the u s and others are just pointing fingers towards others
135661 so much of our mainstream culture is now talked about and thought about in science fictional terms i think thats why people like william gibson and brian aldiss are saying theres no more science fiction because we are now living in the future the present is thinking of itself in science fictional terms you get things like george bush taking stem cell policy from reading parts of brave new world thats part of what we are playing with we are living in world that now thinks of itself in terms of sci fi and in terms of the future

135697 look forward to a long and successful career for him both academically and on the football field
135698 he became involved in a situation at his school during his senior year that certainly has caused us concern at the same time we have personal knowledge of josh through our recruiting contact with him and from personal references from his school and individuals of authority in his life we have already stressed to him that his citizenship is of the utmost importance he understands that anything less than exemplary behavior will not be tolerated

135707 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community
135708 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
135709 i believe we are now on the way to getting there
135710 i dont think that politicizing the olympic games will do anything good to addressing any of the issues
135711 it is only inevitable for people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues
135712 the ioc and the chinese government i think are the ones to be held accountable here i think the blame related for anything related to the politicization of the olympics really falls on their shoulders
135713 the ioc is not true to its word has never been true to its word and the leadership of jacques rogge has seriously and forever damaged the olympic movement
135714 all in all chinas security forces are confident and capable of securing the olympic games
135715 these young people up here cumulatively have provided locally more than 1 000 hours of community service
135716 this program is to be a model and today marks the launching of that flagship which is committed to drawing our young men away from gangs on the street
135717 nobody thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
135718 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
135719 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
135720 i am disappointed that john mccain flipped and changed his position i think in the past he had been opposed to
135721 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
135722 had these figures come with no merger announcement with iberia we believe the shares would have priced in a very weak outlook
135723 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier
135724 were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
135725 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
135726 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
135727 hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
135728 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
135729 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
135730 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
135731 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us

135733 we decided to do this because e4s audience is spending a lot more of their time effort and energy consuming entertainment on the internet as well as from tv so we felt that strategically we needed to follow our audience onto these new platforms
135734 we felt there was an opportunity commercially and certainly in terms of the brand to extend what e4 meant in the marketplace to its audience away from just being a provider of great tv to being a provider of great entertainment whichever platform you happen to be sitting in front of
135735 the skins experiment made the tv industry sort of sit up and take notice building on that success we felt that there was an opportunity to strengthen the relationship our audience has with e4 through the web by building a site that would be much more engaging much more flexible and much more playful than the traditional tv based website
135736 we did acknowledge that our audience is very active in generating user generated content and that its also a great way to get a community to coalesce around a site
135737 as the business owner it was a fantastic process i had so much visibility about what was going on that i could make decisions and remake decisions understanding the consequences of that almost in real time as the project went on i dont think we would have ended up with anything as near as powerful had we not had that process to build it

135745 shes been trying to get me to read them forever and whenever im with her its basically the only thing she talks about
135746 it probably wont come close there was a lot of people here last year for harry potter probably over a thousand at least
135747 i had seen it before but i was thrown off by the vampire thing but then i gave it a chance and fell in love you feel as if you are in the story meyer has this description and passion in her words that makes you feel like you are bella and going through the same thing you can relate to her in a lot of ways
135748 i like that its adventure and written for the teen perspective and clean
135749 theres no sex theres no foul language and yet it can take them on a great adventure without them really having to go over to a dark side
135750 i have a theory you know how all the girls like edward i have a feeling that i wanted to be edward it just kind of works both ways i think
135751 id recommend pretty much anybody to try reading it even guys ill support them its a good book i dont think they should be worried about protecting their masculinity they can go play football after or whatever go put hair on their chests
135752 yeah its a pretty good shaker my chandeliers are swinging a rocking earthquake id call it weve just done an interesting experiment
135753 of course the excitement of writing for twyla in the beginning was both exciting and terrifying because not knowing what to expect out of her you know she has a reputation for being a very exacting and can be a difficult person so i was given all these warnings and admonishments in the end she was by far the easiest part of doing the ballet and the most pleasureful
135754 once we made the decision to have a nonnarrative to not have a story thats kind of a blessing and a curse
135755 as you can imagine the blessing is that well youre not restrained by anything but of course the curse is much greater than the blessing because its a blank page
135756 you start writing some music and well take it from there
135757 and so i kind of dived in on a really broad scale
135758 writing about 13 or 14 pieces ranging from some of them as short as a minute to maybe two or three minutes and brought them back to her and then she got very excited and much to my surprise she was like oh i can definitely do that to this
135759 so i started trying to figure out how to take these ideas and put them in some form
135760 i taught myself to write music without knowing how to read it and that began pre oingo boingo with the mystic knights when i started doing my first compositions for them and transcribing music
135761 someone who can only read as fast as they write
135762 i was strictly an ear musician but i did force myself to write my compositions because thank god i had to had we had midi a special computerized keyboard back then i might have been tempted to not even do that
135763 i have a tremendous internal competition going on between the two composers that are fighting for space
135764 i mean one likes to try to write things melodically and if possible occasionally something poignant or lovely to the ear or with texture or a little deeper and the other is definitely a graffiti artist that likes to mess everything else up and hates to be taken seriously
135765 the way i control these two in the films is because of the film
135766 but given no image in front of them theyre really just elbowing each other and i went through a month where i just couldnt figure it out it was just like a jigsaw puzzle and it wasnt making sense slowly i started to lose the fear of having contrasting elements together i came to the conclusion that that is really what i enjoy is taking wildly diverse elements and moshing them together into a shape that didnt exist before but using elements that are recognizable
135767 she says of course you want to overwhelm it you want to knock them dead
135768 this is not a ballet for purists this is not a ballet for a perfect compliment to
135769 im like how much will it cost me not how much will i make because two extra trips to new york and upgrading my hotel and airfare is already more than im going to earn
135770 if we limit it so theres a cap on the loudness were going to help protect their ears
135771 if you listen to something at more than 100 db for more than 5 minutes you start to damage your ears this will drop volume down by 20 db so if youre around 80 you can listen for 3 to 4 hours
135772 we are thrilled to report a positive outcome for the cll patients in this trial
135773 this also represents a significant achievement for genmab as we now move toward filing of the first marketing applications for a genmab antibody and we look forward to working with gsk on the submissions
135774 these very encouraging results suggest that ofatumumab has the potential to provide benefits to cll patients with very refractory disease and limited treatment options
135775 gsk and genmab are collaborating on a comprehensive development program for cll as well as lymphoma nhl which we hope will make a significant contribution to the management of these haematologic malignancies for both patients and their physicians
135776 a phase 1 2 multicenter open label study of the x linked inhibitor of apoptosis xiap antisense aeg35156 in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma and follicular lymphoma
135777 preliminary evidence of activity in lymphoma was observed in phase 1 studies with aeg35156
135778 this clinical trial will specifically study the role played by xiap knockdown in inducing antitumor activity in cll sll and fl
135779 our clinical program around aeg35156 continues to expand and broaden as we seek to move this therapeutic forward to approval
135780 by adding these lymphoma indications to aeg35156s ongoing phase 1 and 2 studies in leukemia aml pancreatic breast and non small cell lung cancer we continue to seek to position aeg35156 as an important therapeutic option that could address important unmet medical needs across a spectrum of cancer indications i must also thank once again the leukemia amp lymphoma society for their financial support of this study which is the first funding granted for a clinical trial under their new therapy acceleration program
135781 the initiation of patient enrollment and dosing in aegeras clinical trial marks an exciting time for lymphoma patients and llsc we are pleased to help accelerate the testing of a new therapeutic option for blood cancer patients and that canadian lymphoma patients are among the first to participate in this trial

135787 we are excited about the opportunity to improve engagement with our patients through innovative technology for any broad patient communication solution we are always concerned with privacy and data protection the pct has developed guidelines to ensure patient safety that we adhere to according to these guidelines patients can opt out of the service at any time by simply telling their pharmacist or any staff we would encourage all customers to hand in their mobile number so that we can reach them with this new service
135788 we are delighted to support pharmacies delivering public health services
135789 through our technology and knowledge we can let pharmacies benefit from our experience of overseeing dozens of mobile smoking cessation campaigns this will enable them to better serve their communities and improve their businesses in the first stage we aim to enable targeted smoking cessation campaigns in the future we expect to grow the platform to automated services such as repeat prescription and medication reminders we hope to create revenue share based partnerships with pharmacy management systems to achieve this goal

135824 those in the know most of whom dont know who they are or what they know seem to believe that par avion began approximately three months ago with the strange and inexplicable appearance of a frighteningly large hovering tabby cat above a rather dreary and unremarkable village in illinois following this odd occurrence cats across several counties could be seen to act most abnormally and there surfaced several unconfirmed reports of two unusual individuals producing classical music at obscene volume levels during strange hours of the night several residential areas fell victim to damages resembling those of nuclear shock waves and according to at least one crackpot conspiracy theorist the government was involved in actuality a rookie police investigator and many boxes of donuts were involved but these soon disappeared and in the strangest development yet the oddly behaving cats began to converge soon people of the surrounding counties became obsessed with two strange words in what appeared to be another language the language was french and the words were par avion the afflicted citizens began to converge as well until there existed in a rather dreary and unremarkable part of illinois a veritable army of felines and persons united beneath a singular goal of which most of them had absolutely no knowledge who would lead them thats correct dear readers par avion would lead them three quirky individuals and many boxes of donuts and the rest as they dont usually say unless they are par avion is fancy shmancy

135871 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
135872 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something

135875 just as londoners wouldnt tolerate the demolition of their cathedral to make a quick buck so the kondh people wont allow their treasured mountain and forests to be destroyed
135876 pure provocation the principles of respect for popular feeling and of artistic freedom have to find a reciprocal tolerance through good will and with understanding from both sides

135885 en dat snap ik ook wel de aivd wil toch weten of je geen relatie met de zus van willem holleeder hebt gehad daar is geen sprake van ik heb in het verleden wel buitenechtelijke relaties gehad daar heb ik nooit geheimzinnig over gedaan met de eerste relatie ben ik inmiddels acht jaar heel gelukkig getrouwd de andere relatie was met mijn toenmalige baas haar naam wil ik niet noemen tegenover de aivd ik wil haar niet in verlegenheid brengen en daarom vinden ze mij chantabel
135886 als iemand het probeert geef ik m het telefoonnummer van mijn vrouw en wens ik hem veel succes
135887 ik weet ook niet waarop ze dat baseren dat willen ze niet zeggen
135888 misschien willen ze me kwijt korpschef is geen functie waar je de populariteitsprijs mee wint ik heb de afgelopen jaren impopulaire maatregelen genomen soms viel dat niet goed binnen het korps
135889 ik kan deze beschuldigingen niet los zien van het niet verstrekken van de verklaring van geen bezwaar door de aivd
135890 het is niet dat die klachten me niets zeggen ik snap wel dat agenten disciplinaire onderzoeken niet op prijs stellen maar als er klachten of aangiften komen van burgers moeten we die toch onderzoeken
135891 dat kan me niet snel genoeg gebeuren dan zal blijken wat er wel en wat er niet aan de hand is
135892 een kanttekening bij de opzet van het onderzoek dat verder perfect is uitgevoerd
135893 de onderzoekers zijn niet nagegaan of de pati nten met longontsteking ook griep hebben gehad er is bij hen geen bloedonderzoek gedaan in een volgend onderzoek moet dat wel gebeuren

136003 fanfiction existed before the internet so its entirely possible nadia would be writing it even without the computer what she wouldnt have is the community that the internet brings
136004 the absolutely true diary of a part time indian was last years big ya book what i find so fascinating about that situation is that alexie published another book last year with a teenage main character a wonderful unique magical book called flight flight however was published as an adult book whats going on here
136005 even the most timorous teenage girl couldnt conceive of bella as intimidating its hard to imagine a person more insecure or a situation better set up to magnify her insecurities
136006 im like a nail stuck in the wrist of their christmas
136007 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her
136008 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
136009 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard
136010 dave says the neighbor hasnt so much as looked at him since
136011 he played a pivotal role in bringing together different political parties and changing the political scenario

136014 andrei is ready to move to tottenham now it just depends on zenit
136015 arshavin changed his decision about joining spurs due to excellent interest from spurs
136016 they are the one team that fully agreed his contract demands and ready to pay almost the full price that zenit wants
136017 juande ramos called andrei and described his vision of football and his vision of andreis future in the team
136018 ramos said that arshavin will be a key player of his team and he is highly interested in this deal
136019 spurs had the money for andrei all the time and their interest isnt new but zenit doesnt want to say that they have official offer from tottenham but they have it
136020 i dont think the deal can be delayed until the super cup against manchester united because im unsure that todays arshavin can be useful for zenit
136021 i hope that zenit will collect themselves i know the high level of professionalism of zenits new president alexander dukov and his great personality
136022 we have certain contacts with tottenham but when they will conclude i still do not know
136023 tottenham have an interest in the player and i understand that the player has an interest in the club too
136024 im due to go to london and take a look over everything but no deal has been done yet with arsenal
136025 it is difficult for us to take a decision but arsenal is certainly something that gokhan needs to look at

136032 lothian and borders police attended and the situation has been resolved
136033 in his case we can fully exclude the possibility of collecting beetles for reasons other than research
136034 when you are studying insects there are basically three ways to obtain samples of particular species
136035 you can use existing collections which are often devoid of new species or you can request samples from larger institutions or on location scientists which is expensive the third option of course is to go out and obtain the samples yourself
136036 they claim that the intention for collection was mainly for research but there is a serious implication of an import and export business on rare insects
136037 they allegedly did not realize this because they saw cows grazing and people cutting wood nearby
136038 at a time when the hills of darjeeling are restless on the demand of a separate state a few foreigners have been gadding around the hillside collecting beetles

136051 what happened on the day of this incident was a dreadful tragedy
136052 as a result of this incident mr mcgregor has been deprived of his wife and the children have been deprived of their mother
136053 it is of course impossible for the court to place a value on the life of mrs mcgregor that is not the purpose of a sentence in a criminal case
136054 whatever sentence i impose will not take away the pain of the enormous loss which the mcgregor family have sustained nor will it reconcile them to their loss

136057 in our area it s dry normally we wouldn t be selling in july we usually sell in august or september
136058 i believe a bunch of cows will be sold this fall because hay is going to be higher plus freight is going to be higher and it isn t going to be in our area because we just do not have the hay in the area to purchase

136061 iron is the single most important micronutrient bacteria need to survive
136062 understanding how these bacteria thrive within us is a critical element of learning how to defeat them
136063 its amazing that the bacteria could learn to extract iron from their environment in this way
136064 we went into these experiments with no idea that this mechanism existed but then bacteria have to be creative to survive in some very hostile environments and theyve had maybe 3 5 billion years to figure it out

136110 the results of the present study show a marked increase in antiviral effect in patients when ribavirin is added to the combination of r1626 and peginterferon alfa 2a
136111 this phase 2a study has demonstrated a potent reduction in hcv rna by r1626 and high viral responses with up to 74 percent rapid viral response after 4 weeks of treatment the strong antiviral effect between r1626 peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin suggests that the dose of one or both of these agents could be lowered to improve tolerability without significantly compromising efficacy
136112 the decreases in hcv rna from baseline observed with r1626 indicates potent antiviral activity and lack of viral load rebound in the significant majority of patients following 14 days of monotherapy

136120 so much of the focus on this issue has been in africa but there the interface between humans and other primates is decreasing
136121 the intensity of bush meat hunting and infectious diseases have taken a huge toll on primate populations there individuals in africa who are interacting with other primates are often very isolated from other humans they live in small rural villages which limits the potential spread of pathogens
136122 some macaque species thrive in human altered environments given the tolerance of the local people
136123 this is a heterogeneous sample subjects reported contact with primates in a variety of contexts
136124 it seems that some of these contexts are going to be very important but they havent been studied much zoo workers and bush meat hunters have been typically considered at the highest risk for viral transmission but none of the zoo workers or hunters in our sample tested positive for sfv

136192 no one is going to be paying these tickets they are homeless and the idea of them having 75 to pay a ticket for sleeping outside is pretty absurd
136193 we know shelters are running at maximum capacity every night they are turning away dozens of people every day
136194 when there is a lack of affordable housing for people to move into and when shelters are turning them away and they have no place to go it is unconstitutional to ticket them for sleeping outside
136195 the charter of rights and freedoms protects peoples right to life liberty and security of the person we say ticketing people for sleeping outside when they have no other realistic alternative is a violation to their right of security of the person
136196 i have not received any tickets and so i cannot comment on it
136197 if drug dealers are moving in we want to find a way to keep them out its unsafe for the residents

136202 there are no suggestions that any efforts have been made by r s malik to perform in accordance with his part of the bargain he made
136203 it means the province can start collecting at least some of the more than 6 million that was advanced to mr malik for his legal costs
136204 mr malik had signed an agreement to repay the funds that were advanced to him it is regrettable the province had to commence a foreclosure action in order to realize those funds
136205 if you ask those to whom this has happened they know that children shouldnt be left alone in the car but at that particular moment their minds are elsewhere they have some other problem
136206 its not intentional by any means its like knowing that you shouldnt leave a child alone at the side of a swimming pool but in spite of that it happens
136207 when it comes to leaving a child in a car these people have obviously had difficulties or are preoccupied by other things had other thing to do during several hours and at the last moment forget that there is a child still in the car
136208 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest

136236 the australian government has formed the view that the safeguards agreement is a positive step which will strengthen nuclear non proliferation efforts and is consistent with the non proliferation objectives of the nuclear non proliferation treaty
136237 it has no effect nor does it require a change to the australian labor partys long standing approach of not exporting uranium to a country thats not a party to the npt
136238 if we were to change our policy approach on uranium it would seriously undermine the nuclear non proliferation treaty we want that treaty to be enhanced
136239 well take a positive and constructive approach and we will certainly have non proliferation considerations uppermost in mind
136240 but we will also take into account the strategic importance of the arrangement to both india and the united states
136241 its a totally different game than what weve played over the last how many years
136242 certainly were learning about these laws just like the players are and so i think thats the circumstances that youre looking at and thats why youve got quite a bit of change in policy as you go on as you get used to these laws and adjust to them
136243 the players have been playing with them from the start so if they hadnt been exposed to them that would be probably more of an issue
136244 to be honest they probably profited from them more than we did in the first encounter
136245 weve talked to the players about various policies playing under these elvs
136246 i guess until you really face the challenge and you come up short that you really have to think deeply about whats going on there
136247 i watch a bit of rugby on video and try and analyse the game and spend a lot of time doing that and so do the other two guys assistant coaches
136248 we thought we had done that pretty well but until you get into the heat of the battle i guess thats the big learning experience

136264 the last 25 years have seen huge changes in manchesters science and industry as the city and region moves away from the core products of manufacturing and engineering and into the service sector and creative industries

136268 yeah it looked a bit dodgy there in the first half alright and i got a fair fright but it was more cramp than anything as i have done very little training over the last number of weeks and this was a second big game in a week but thankfully it passed off and i was able to last out the 70 minutes
136269 goals win games and that goal really came at the right time for us as up to that we were messing around with the ball too much at times during that first half and in fairness to wexford when they got their chances to punish us they did so we were delighted to go into half time in front
136270 then in the second half when they got those two quick goals i think we really showed our mental strength we knew there was only going to be a puck of a ball in it and we were ready and prepared for that and i was confident that if they had got that penalty that we still would have come back
136271 weve trained for that and i suppose a lot of people would have predicted us to come out on the wrong side of that game in that sort of situation in the past but there is a lot character in this team and that is only shown by the fact that weve lost five semi finals but we keep coming back
136272 there is poor morale among the side relationships between players arent great and there are several cliques within the panel what can i do to unite the lads
136273 you need to have discipline and a sense of responsibility among the players
136274 you have a meeting at the start of the year where everyone agrees to meet certain standards i always say to a group of 15 there are five excellent fellas here five mediocre ones and five messers its up to you to decide on whose level we want to play the game this year we can all strive to be excellent and derive a lot of satisfaction from the year ahead or we can descend to the level of the messers and just play a bit of pub soccer instead
136275 but this does not mean you are autocratic instead you try and do the hardest thing make the players think about things and decide the responsibility is with themselves
136276 if someone arrives late for training then you challenge him he has agreed to do something and has not done it he may have a good excuse but it is up to him to call you before training when the coach takes the roll call at the start of the evening everyone has to be accounted for
136277 people will give you a lot more credit than you deserve
136278 cs that enabled waterford to prevail in a torrid non stop action game that had the fans on their toes and tenterhooks from fist memorable minute to last
136279 cs that ultimately decided this cracking game in waterfords favour
136280 with a performance like that clearly however that was manager giving an early kick start to the mind games for that upcoming semi final because in the very next breath he was exuberantly enthused about the teams refusal to accept defeat even when the tide of battle was raging against them
136281 i am so happy about the way we didnt give up when the game turned against us twice and even three times said fitzgerald
136282 that is the hallmark of a good player and a good team and while it was far from being our best performance nothing can take from the heart and spirit every player produced
136283 do them down after the defeat in the munster championship but from the day he took over as manager following that high profile sacking of justin mccarthy he knew and believed that they would come good
136284 excep tional in the way that they have applied themselves in training and that was mirrored in their absolute commitment to beating wex ford in a game when so many serious questions were asked of them
136285 one man team nothing however could be further from the truth he said and with every forward getting on the score sheet against wexford that piece of folly had been put to rest
136286 it may have taken john a bit of time to get into his stride but when he did he was unstoppable said fitzie
136287 in that second half in particular he turned the game for us more than once he scored himself at crucial times and then set up others for equally vital scores
136288 while three in as many games might not be all that many i just didnt like the way in which we gave them away today on another occasion we would be brutally punished especially by a team of tipperarys undoubted class
136289 of course i was delighted to get a goal but i dont mind who scores once we win i got a goal but sure eoin kelly got one in the first half and we probably could got a couple of more in the second half with the space that we had but all that matters is that we won and were delighted
136290 i know i can always get goals if i get the ball around the square ill always fancy my chances of getting a goal but i wouldnt get them but for the delivery and the hard work of the fellas around me
136291 i have been critcised this year and fellas will say that it was about time shanahan woke up but that doesnt bother me and hopefully ill get a few more before the year is out
136292 that was extremely tough out there wexford gave us a game and a half but we expected that it was the same last week against offaly and i think that game definitely brought us on and stood to us there today but the main thing is that we won and we won as a team and thats all that counts
136293 justin mccarthy laid very firm foundations that have enabled fitzie to get on as successfully as he has with his job but we can never and must never close our eyes to all that his predecessor did for waterford hurling in the years he was in managerial charge said geary
136294 an instant hit with everyone in the camp players management colleagues and every other member of the backroom team
136295 his work rate is exceptional and despite a four or five hour return drive every training night he involves himself in each session in an incredibly committed and passionate way geary said
136296 it really is a privilege to work alongside the man
136297 the players see that for themselves and are responding in kind
136298 everything he fitzie has asked of them since his arrival they have done it he has brought a huge amount to the hurling set up in the county in a very short time
136299 it will be a very tall order for anyone to end that remarkable unbeaten run but thats what we must do next month if we are to make it onto all ireland final stage for the first time in forty four long years said geary
136300 they are getting better with ever game and they have moulded together an ideal blending of youth and experience they will be the raging favourites to defeat us in the semi final but going into that game as rank outsiders will be ideal from our perspective
136301 deadly duo who he added would pose a huge threat to every other fullback line in the game
136302 circumstances that have forced them into playing him in the full back position
136303 of course in an ideal situation ken would be an automatic choice for centre back but we dont have that ideal situation to rely on and so it has become a
136304 davys idea has been that we build from the back and the results todate have proven that he is right
136305 a team of lesser resolve just might have folded then but that is never an option for any players under the charge of a man like davy fitz said geary
136306 if anything having lost those five semi finals should be an added motivation to go one better this time he said
136307 how may times did padraig harrington have to settle for being runner up and then going on to win the british open in successive years
136308 she should not have been told that she should have been helped to find a place for the dog overnight
136309 there is a problem in the summertime the number of stray dogs peaks because of children on school holidays playing with dogs and letting them get away
136310 they said there are no kennels for tonight theyre all full so either someone can take her in for the night or put her back on the street
136311 there was no way i was putting a stray dog on the street
136312 nobody in their right mind should put another living being onto the street and expect someone else to deal with it something has to be done because it cant keep happening
136313 they call waterford a football mad town they told me when i came here that waterford was a sleeping giant in football terms but that is certainly not the case what more can we do to get people into the ground
136314 we put three a past limerick and then hit monaghan for five plus another four tonight we are two points behind dundalk with a real chance of promotion why cant we get some big attendances that would help the players and help the club
136315 i asked the players for a big performance against longford and they produced it i asked them why cant waterford united win this fight for promotion
136316 we are in a battle now and we have to show the bottle needed the play ers are good enough and have now gone six games unbeaten
136317 now is the time to show our fighting qualities and keep fighting until the end of the season and i am sure if we do that than we can finish on top of the table
136318 tonight we were very impressive eventhough i felt we had a sloppy first half
136319 grincell is certainly a player for the future at the moment we have two experienced strikers in karl bermingham and vinny sullivan both of them know the game and their opponents david defiantly makes a big impact when he joins the game and he is not far off a starting place but we dont want to expose him too tough defenders to soon
136320 once again john hayes showed what a fine player he is with another top class display to night we lost david breen to ill ness for the wexford game and john stepped in and was superb for this game we were without the suspended kenny browne but once again john showed his class by stepping up to the mark and putting in another top performance
136321 jennifer pushes me out of bed to go and check on the twins

136327 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
136328 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
136329 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
136330 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
136331 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
136332 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
136333 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase
136334 hes just not dealing with the same set of cards he had in spring training

136341 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
136342 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
136343 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
136344 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
136345 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
136346 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
136347 i can see some people have some input that i am missing but i would like to hear from them
136348 for the complete success of the beijing olympic games our utmost priority is to ensure it is safe
136349 this division is stationed in beijing and our main task is to secure the capital
136350 i believe that during the games there will be terrorist organisations both inside and outside of china who will try to sabotage and interfere with the games proceedings
136351 all in all chinas security forces are confident and capable of safeguarding the olympic games
136352 i believe that they have such criticism because they have little idea about the pla

136368 this new feature does not change anything at all about how you search on google and the results you get it just gives you more of a behind the scenes look at how we customise your search experience
136369 i dont think retailers can ever surpass wikipedia because of the two key pillars in search engine optimization relevant content and sites linking to you both of which wikipedia dominates
136370 whenever a retailer sees a wikipedia listing appear in search results that retailer should immediately ask are there pages on my web site that meet the searchers informational needs
136371 many retail web sites contain informational pages but many retailers might not realize it
136372 retailers test their campaigns and measure the results but they should also compile five to 10 keywords for each of their skus and test those
136373 the additional testing will produce better keyword combinations and more focused campaigns
136374 retailers can see who their competition is by viewing the rankings on a google page
136375 but they shouldnt weigh the total outcome of a paid campaign simply on where they rank on a page they should focus on whether the campaign generated the best return on investment by looking at all of the relevant points

136387 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

136396 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
136397 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
136398 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
136399 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
136400 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
136401 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
136402 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
136403 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
136404 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we

136408 once the armed forces release spectrum we may accommodate more operators for 3g services
136409 we welcome the governments announcement of its 3g policy and believe this will benefit the entire wireless communications ecosystem

136415 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
136416 after extensively researching the real estate industry we found what features consumers and professionals wanted in a web site and we improved or enhanced them for example we added the niche search option for those who need to find a specific type of property faster
136417 realizing the value of comparison shopping we developed a compare tool which allows you to view the key features for several listings side by side this helps you find your needle in the haystack faster and more efficiently
136418 our research shows that consumers want and need qualified professionals
136419 they include an agent who is a local expert in the market an experienced attorney competitive lender certified home inspector and appraiser

136423 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
136424 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
136425 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
136426 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
136427 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
136428 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
136429 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
136430 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
136431 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
136432 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
136433 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
136434 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

136436 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
136437 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
136438 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
136439 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
136440 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
136441 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
136442 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
136443 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
136444 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
136445 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
136446 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
136447 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
136448 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
136449 who are open to doing something on the production side
136450 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
136451 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
136452 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
136453 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
136454 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
136455 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
136456 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
136457 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
136458 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
136459 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
136460 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
136461 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
136462 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
136463 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
136464 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
136465 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
136466 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
136467 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
136468 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
136469 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
136470 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
136471 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
136472 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
136473 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
136474 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
136475 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
136476 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
136477 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
136478 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
136479 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
136480 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
136481 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
136482 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
136483 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
136484 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
136485 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
136486 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
136487 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
136488 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
136489 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
136490 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
136491 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
136492 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
136493 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
136494 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
136495 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
136496 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
136497 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
136498 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
136499 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
136500 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
136501 its on a mud flat at the moment and we are trying to get closer to it

136540 the race has been very close before with obama holding a one point lead as recently as july 15 17 and the race tied for several days in late june
136541 the story of the election through the summer months has been a close race that simply does not seem to want to change obama has generally been in the lead and it is significant that mccain has never held even a one point lead among registered voters in gallup poll daily tracking since obama clinched the democratic nomination in early june
136542 the relative stability of the race even in the aftermath of such a high visibility event as obamas foreign trip coupled of course with the mccain campaigns vigorous efforts to defuse its impact continues to suggest that it may be the conventions in late august and early september that will offer the next potential timeframe for significant and or sustained change

136580 heres an excellent example of the usefulness of medical library blogs
136581 yesterday david rothman of community general hospital of greater syracuse posted a comment on the advantages of rss he may have been too shy to point out his blog and the very cool things he is doing with rss to keep clinicians informed check out this posting and get inspired
136582 i was honored david let me post his essay about rss and medical libraries here at ttw and tickled when he launched his blog
136583 for medical librarians check out david rothman who actually gets the value of rss feeds for clinicians and delivers useful commentary and information for librarians if i were in charge of a library id actively recruit david to be on my team if youre not a librarian check out his blog anyway for a peak behind the librarian curtain and a view of the kinds of services you should be getting
136584 i consider david rothman the rss feed advocate for medical libraries he does so much with rss feeds and he is constantly looking for instances where they are applicable to medical libraries when i have an rss feed question i pick his brain
136585 im not even a medical health science librarian and im fascinated by the work yall are doing
136586 your blog is always interesting really look forward to your posts
136587 i always talk about your blog because ive found it useful and interesting so ill take this opportunity to say a big thank you for your blog keep writing
136588 your blog seems to have caught the eye of quite a few people your efforts have opened a lot of eyes about the possibilities of setting up rss feeds directly for end users resulting in encouraging greater investigation of and participation in electronic delivery on the part of the patron i will be following your blog with great interest
136589 you have a great blog with many useful comments links and lots of original content i really enjoy reading it keep up the good work
136590 i love your blog i get so much info from it if others arent reading it its their loss
136591 you post so many new and amazing things it makes my head spin i wish i had more time to investigate and implement even a 1 4 of the things youve discovered weve been using your consumer health federated search engine link via google its great i dont worry about the quality of the results like i would doing a wide open google search youve included the sources we all know and love thanks for putting that together its a tremendous service to consumer health librarians and their patrons professional or lay level
136592 david rothman finds the most interesting things to share on his blog he writes about and gives real life examples of web2 0 and library2 0 put to use in health sciences libraries many of the ideas and applications he flags have wider applicability outside the health sciences well worth the read if youre interested in what hsl2 0 might look like
136593 i really value your blog its one of the blogs that i look at on a daily basis to see if there is anything that our journal editors might find useful or if there is anything that we could adapt to make our online journals better
136594 i love your blog and it has proven to be invaluable to me in learning how technology can be used in the medical library world thank you

136653 our ministers waste their time in political intrigue instead of trying to help make the country more competitive
136654 i am innocent and i am confident that i will clear my name
136655 pas leaders have assured me that they have no desire of leaving the pakatan and joining the barisan or merging with umno

136657 any attempts to delay the by election which must be held within 60 days after the election commission is notified or to arrest him or charge him in court will be seen by his supporters as a form of victimisation
136658 also he is already scheduled to address the people in permatang pauh this saturday its a well thought plan to pre empt bns efforts to derail his political agenda
136659 im not surprised if anwar can increase the number for the constituents they know they are going to vote for a prime minister
136660 it will even be better than the recent general election we have received news that the local pas leaders will begin to mobilise their election machinery to help us even dap members are excited about this
136661 mengapa tidak dengan umno mereka pun hampir setiap hari melambai lambai tangan agar pas bersama mereka
136662 the meeting will also determine the dates to issue the writ and notices to pave the way for the by election as well as to decide on which electoral roll to be used
136663 this is a place that would afford him the best chance to win so we will leave it to the permatang pauh voters to decide we will try our best
136664 the allegation against him was made by his own staff not the government
136665 but we accept his decision and we will face it anything can happen in a by election

136670 health concerns with incineration remain unanswered and the precautionary principle should be adopted
136671 incineration is being used as an easy fix for our waste problems and stops us addressing the real problem with our waste that we are producing too much
136672 incineration suppresses recycling and reduction of waste at source we have a massive waste problem in the county but burning it is the wrong way to tackle it
136673 well if youve got a slowing economy coming off the back of the highest inflation rate in 16 years and 12 interest rate rises in a row then the flow through to growth in the economy and the flow through to employment one just follows the other
136674 they said they didnt need permission its extremely arrogant im concerned about the intrusion into peoples private lives

136778 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community
136779 we met with beijing organisers and the chinese authorities yesterday and they have addressed these issues
136780 a number of websites are now available thats what counts that things are moving forward we are pleased with the way they have handled and resolved the issues
136781 beijing organizers will honor the promise to the ioc to provide sufficient access
136782 at the moment the channel for reporters to use the internet is fully open
136783 its good news that our site has been unblocked in olympic venues and perhaps elsewhere in beijing but it is still a long way from the complete media freedom promised
136784 chinese people have just as much right to freedom of information as everyone else yet this right has been systematically denied we are calling on the chinese government to end internet repression
136785 it seems public outrage has succeeded where the iocs quiet diplomacy had failed its time for the olympic movement and world leaders to speak up about human rights for china
136786 there have always been assumptions that a hotspot has always been there and it is an area that produces its own diversity
136787 temperature is certainly facilitating diversity but if it was only temperature in the eocene you would have really high diversity in modern africa

136794 the volume and quality of data available are sufficient to publish provisional national results and that there is broad consistency of results with previous years
136795 ofqual recognises that the confidence of teachers parents pupils and the wider public has been damaged by the problems in delivering this years national curriculum tests
136796 however ofqual advised that as at 28 july there was no evidence of widespread problems with the quality of the marks at key stage 2 that would justify withholding publication of the provisional results at national level
136797 ofqual will be closely monitoring the review process to ensure that it is carried through accurately and objectively so that pupils get the marks their work deserves
136798 ets do still have a substantial number of scripts that remain to be marked and entered
136799 qca would like to reassure schools that they are working closely with ets europe to ensure these tasks are completed as quickly as possible
136800 we expect that these outstanding scripts will significantly close the gap alongside resolution of outstanding data processing issues
136801 while the government offers bland reassurances that things will be alright on the night teachers heads and parents have lost faith in ministers handling of this years tests
136802 schools across the country have reported wildly erratic and inconsistent marking and there will be a significant number of appeals
136803 parents and pupils need certainty that this fiasco will not be repeated next year and the government isnt providing it

136832 erm not this time she just dropped it and its not moving yeah looks like a bat
136833 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
136834 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
136835 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
136836 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
136837 hello you must see it lol my friend catched you on hidden cam
136838 it is no longer within the power of opec to keep prices at 28 a barrel opec can only set the floor not the ceiling
136839 the fed is printing money and are trying to prevent the recession they are putting on band aids
136840 as long as the us central bank and the federal government keep making mistakes you will have a longer period of slowdown and it will be perhaps one of the worst recessions we have had in a long time in america
136841 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else
136842 if youre just driving around you might not notice it
136843 the majority are being caught in the shrimp trawls particularly in the gulf of mexico
136844 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized

136852 its really just an alternative that we gave the council the timetable depends on when the environmental is through
136853 we will be ready to go about 60 90 days after we get everything cleared meaning the environmental etc im thinking its going to be at least next spring but if its ready to go before then well be ready to jump in and get started
136854 we caught the two and tried to escort them off the property and the guys just gone beserk thrashing out kicking and actually biting one of the security people breaking his finger drawing blood and screaming that he had hepatitis c
136855 im sure they will do well together they are an ideal pairing really so i am looking forward to having them playing
136856 in other positions i think we look a bit under strength in all honesty but up front we look good
136857 were getting our season ticket base back and thats what it is all about
136858 dallas is a city that loves winners whether its the stars or the mavs or the cowboys and hopefully someday its going to be the rangers again theres a lot more interest when they feel like youre going to win
136859 tallene var som ventet ledigheten har n v rt 2 4 2 5 prosent siden oktober i fjor vi ligger p bunnen sysselsettingsveksten har imidlertid kommet godt ned ikke lenge til f r ledigheten tikker oppover det er ingen grunn til endre v rt rentesyn p bakgrunn av disse tallene
136860 dette var veldig svakt riksbankens rentebane virker lite sannsynlig etter disse tallene

136872 one would not have to be thin skinned to perceive these comments as hostile to persons of jewish faith
136873 sporadic and not sufficiently severe to create a hostile work environment
136874 when the appellate court decision was issued there was a lot of concern from elements of the jewish community that there would be an unfair standard for establishing anti semitism in the workplace
136875 you cant even joke any longer in the workplace its an important decision because it gives notice to employees and employers
136876 there isnt any room in the workplace to joke about ethnicity
136877 we certainly feel sorry for the taxpayers of haddonfield because millions of dollars have been thrown away for nothing
136878 the humor file was not the haddonfield police departments brightest day
136879 i believe new jersey and its courageous families have shouldered the burden of these wars and now with this deployment we have gone above and beyond the call of duty
136880 in the last decade a new trend has developed in the accommodations industry
136881 buildings organized under condominium form of ownership are being operated with rooms rented as motel units on a daily basis
136882 the conversion of properties from traditional hotels to condotels has been hastened by the tax advantage conferred upon them by the state
136883 the missing persons issue was a kind of taboo on our side
136884 people were told they are dead dont look for them the missing persons issue was a zone of silence in our community and i wanted to break that silence
136885 both sides have started to appreciate the pain of the other side
136886 many of the people ive interviewed never told these stories even to their wives or husbands nobody asked them for their stories before nobody has dealt with these traumas
136887 the two communities initially decided not to deal with this issue and to hide it
136888 this is a wound a wound that touches all of us and that gave great suffering to those involved
136889 i am a kind of sitting target even if the killer has died their sons have threatened me ive also received threats from villages where there are burial sites and that dont want any digging there
136890 these extraordinary journalists have shown bravery amidst threats and intimidation
136891 they are heroines of a free press and provide us with role models for the very best journalism in the world today
136892 i am using it to create empathy and bring people together it helps to break these taboos about talking about this subject
136893 but now im feeling better stronger the sadness is still there but its not as strong we feel more at peace
136894 i can sympathize with the families on the other side

136911 i ended up mistiming it and going over the ball with two feet
136912 it was an accident and there was nothing malicious in it i am just glad i didnt seriously hurt the player
136913 it felt good to be back ive had the injury for a few months so it was good to be back playing alongside the lads
136914 ive got a few bumps and bruises but thats a good feeling having played a game
136915 i was just looking forward to playing i was desperate to play it was longer than i was expecting to get and i felt good fitness wise
136916 i have told him and i just will not have that he has apologised but it is the player he made the tackle on he should be apologising to
136917 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
136918 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
136919 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
136920 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
136921 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
136922 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
136923 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
136924 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
136925 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
136926 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
136927 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
136928 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
136929 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
136930 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
136931 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
136932 we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
136933 i think people for some reason think hes lazy and a bad teammate and that he doesnt care
136934 hes none of the above does he do some goofy things absolutely he does do some goofy things but as far as preparation and knowing the game and wanting to win theres no way you put up those numbers year in and year out unless youre a special talent and work at it and he does both
136935 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
136936 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
136937 i believe we are now on the way to getting there
136938 i just got the message early this morning that everything had opened up and im very happy about that
136939 and were keeping our promises when bidding for the games to provide good environment and a quality service for reporters using the internet to cover the olympic games and we administer the internet by law
136940 i have absolute assurance from the president of the ioc that no new arrangements have been entered into with the local organizing committee bocog or the chinese authorities in respect to censorship for the international press to report on the games
136941 locked away in quarantine or shot dead by the us government
136942 will i just take the team off so that you can hand rangers the points
136943 un nome strano e che non assomigliava a nessuno dei presidenti che appaiono sulle banconote da uno e da cinque dollari
136944 barack obama ha giocato la carta razziale e lha pescata dal fondo del mazzo e divisivo negativo vergognoso e sbagliato
136945 il fattore della razza non avr alcun ruolo nella mia campagna elettorale non ci sar alcuno spazio per queste cose mi dispiace che lui obama labbia usata
136946 mi immaginavo che avremmo avuto un confronto serio ma finora ho solo sentito parlare di paris hilton e britney spears quindi devo chiedere al mio rivale questo il meglio che puoi fare
136947 come out and if youre brilliant youre brilliant and if youre crap youre crap

136989 dan taatlah kamu kepada allah dan rasulnya dan janganlah kamu berbantah bantahan kalau tidak nescaya kamu menjadi lemah semangat dan hilang kekuatan kamu dan sabarlah menghadapi segala kesukaran dengan cekal hati sesungguhnya allah berserta orang orang yang sabar
136990 serulah ke jalan tuhanmu wahai muhammad dengan hikmat kebijaksanaan dan nasihat pengajaran yang baik dan berbahaslah dengan mereka yang engkau serukan itu dengan cara yang lebih baik sesungguhnya tuhanmu dialah jua yang lebih mengetahui akan orang orang yang sesat dari jalannya dan dialah jua yang lebih mengetahui akan orang orang yang mendapat hidayah
136991 barangsiapa yang menjalin persaudaraan kerana allah maka allah akan meninggikan darjatnya di dalam syurga tidak condong suatu apapun dalam amalannya
136992 suatu kelompok manusia kelak akan memperoleh kursi di sekitar arsy pada hari kiamat wajah mereka bagaikan bulan purnama pada malam lailatul qadar waktu itu manusia terkejut padahal mereka tidak merasa terkejut dan manusia takut padahal mereka tidak merasa takut mereka itu adalah auliya allah yang tidak pernah takut terhadap mereka musuh musuh allah dan tidak pernah merasa khuatir
136993 a landmark building leeds academy is set to be the largest independent venue in the city adding to the existing vibrant music scene the academy is the perfect size to attract major touring acts its always exciting to develop a venue with such history and keep as many original features and grandeur of its former years by converting back to the theatre format but adding up to the minute production values and new technology with outstanding artist and customer facilities
136994 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
136995 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
136996 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
136997 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
136998 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
136999 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
137000 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
137001 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
137002 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
137003 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
137004 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
137005 my husband is absolutley opposed to any negative campaigning at all
137006 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
137007 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
137008 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
137009 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
137010 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
137011 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
137012 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
137013 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
137014 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
137015 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
137016 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
137017 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
137018 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
137019 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
137020 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
137021 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
137022 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
137023 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
137024 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
137025 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
137026 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
137027 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
137028 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
137029 no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american public
137030 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
137031 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
137032 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
137033 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
137034 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
137035 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
137036 junk propaganda emanating from the intergovernmental panel on climate change and scientists like david suzuki et al
137037 in 10 to 12 years we will reach the tipping point
137038 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
137039 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
137040 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
137041 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
137042 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
137043 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
137044 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
137045 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
137046 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
137047 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
137048 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
137049 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
137050 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
137051 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
137052 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
137053 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
137054 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
137055 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
137056 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
137057 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
137058 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
137059 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
137060 hes the only naked man that will ever be in my bedroom
137061 it can be frustrating knowing people who supported clinton and edwards who still say they dont know what to do
137062 hes in danger of being sucked into a negative campaign
137063 mccains trying to make him out to be a risky unsure leader he has to respond but has to stay above the fray its a very thin line
137064 the idea that voters pay attention to three or four critical moments of a campaign is a theory thats outmoded
137065 with the 24 hour news cycle you have a lot more process coverage and everything tends to flatten out instead of peaks and valleys you have more of a straight road a lot of times people simply arent paying attention to whats supposed to be a critical moment
137066 he has problems that no candidate has ever had before
137067 hes the first person of color to be the nominee of his party he had to show he could be on the international stage with foreign leaders and he did that now what he has to do is get back to relating to regular people gore had to do it and never quite succeeded to get there
137068 i tried to get him to water ski because he was good at it i tried to get him to play pick up basketball but he wouldnt do that because he thought hed be copying former new jersey sen bill bradley he played pool and he wouldnt do that in public either these were all things that would make him approachable to ordinary people and he just wouldnt do them that what obama has to do make the public understand what hes really like and how he relates to them
137069 americans are looking to see if he can do the job of president of the united states what we he have to do over the next 97 days in convince them he can
137070 the voters we need to get are people not a whole unlike obama
137071 they werent born into a wealthy family and theyve worked hard for what they have obviously you have to demonstrate hes a real person and thats the easiest thing in the world to do because hes the most down to earth candidate ive ever worked for and i think the size of events is important you look at today we have two town halls and a barbecue you cant get much closer to the ground than that i think thats the kind of campaign youll see us run for the rest of the race
137072 are you better off now than you were four years ago
137073 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
137074 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
137075 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
137076 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
137077 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
137078 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
137079 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
137080 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
137081 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
137082 i felt like if youre going to clean something it really should be clean
137083 but i had seven children i wanted to go on home i told him im not staying these arent slavery times anymore he said i had to stay i walked
137084 one day we decided to march on the welfare office we asked to see their policies their manual of how they would treat us they said the state couldnt do that so we went up the back steps on a friday afternoon went into the directors office and told him we wouldnt let him leave
137085 storming caesars palace how black mothers fought their own war on poverty
137086 finally we understand that the civil rights movement was a lot bigger and longer than martin luther king as wonderful and important as he was
137087 there are so many levels on which this movement was important not only statewide but nationwide
137088 and theres no question ruby was in the absolute forefront
137089 as long as they graduated and walked across that stage that was enough
137090 it was exciting to see how poor people could stand up
137091 just the way she looked you could feel her power it was so uplifting
137092 im glad shes finally being recognized for all that shes done
137093 so many people give up homes so many jobless people
137094 let somebody make me wealthy before i leave just for one year
137095 i would buy me a nice home in a decent neighborhood i would have me a better car i would love to go to one of those hotels lay up and have a massage i would go to paris london italy i would live for once in my life
137096 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
137097 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
137098 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
137099 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
137100 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
137101 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
137102 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
137103 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
137104 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
137105 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
137106 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
137107 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
137108 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
137109 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
137110 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
137111 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
137112 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
137113 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
137114 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
137115 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
137116 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
137117 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
137118 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
137119 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
137120 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
137121 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
137122 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
137123 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
137124 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
137125 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
137126 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
137127 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
137128 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
137129 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
137130 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
137131 you know life shouldnt be hard its all about connecting and finding a reason for it
137132 how many times has she gotten me involved in things even when ive said no im not doing it
137133 its just something about jaki she has a way of talking people into doing things without them even realizing it
137134 you cant help but get sucked in shes so approachable
137135 my business is my life and im ok with that
137136 i think she would love to have a significant other an equal whos really the key person in her life
137137 she needs someone to share it with because shes accumulated so much and i dont just mean wealth
137138 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
137139 an oil man reacting to the largest transfer of wealth in history
137140 mr gores focus is primarily on solar wind and geothermal energy his belief is that a dramatic wholesale transition to these abundant and renewable sources of energy is not just doable but essential
137141 for years rep jay inslee d wash has been frustrated with congress inability to devise a clean energy policy so he decided to do something about it without markups or bills or committees he decided to write a book center for american progress inslee depicts an economic shift necessary to ease america into a clean energy revolution in the book which was released by island press on oct 1 2007
137142 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
137143 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
137144 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
137145 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
137146 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
137147 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
137148 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
137149 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
137150 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
137151 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
137152 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
137153 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
137154 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
137155 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
137156 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
137157 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
137158 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
137159 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
137160 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
137161 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
137162 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
137163 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
137164 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
137165 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
137166 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
137167 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
137168 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
137169 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
137170 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
137171 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
137172 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
137173 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
137174 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
137175 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
137176 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
137177 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
137178 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
137179 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
137180 how the women of the media sell unhappiness and liberalism to the women of america
137181 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
137182 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
137183 two canaries in the coal mine the first one is in the arctic of course the arctic ocean has a floating ice cap greenland on its side there i say canary in the coal mine because the arctic is one part of the world that is experiencing faster impact from global warming this is the largest ice shelf in the arctic the ward hunt ice shelf it just cracked in half a year ago the scientists were astonished
137184 current coastal temperatures are about 1 c below their 1940 values
137185 at the summit of the greenland ice sheet the summer average temperature has decreased at the rate of 2 2 c per decade since the beginning of the measurements in 1987
137186 colors indicate ice sheet elevation change rate in cm year from satellite altimeter data 1992 2003 the spatially averaged increase is 5 4 0 2 cm year
137187 shut off would imply repeal of the law of conservation of angular momentum widely disseminated and grossly oversimplified pictures showing the ocean as a conveyor belt have misled people into thinking ocean circulation is driven by a sinking motion at high latitudes
137188 temperature records show that the arctic was in fact warmer in the 1930s and 1940s than it is today
137189 2007 winter sea ice extent at both poles reached record highs
137190 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
137191 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
137192 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
137193 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
137194 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
137195 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
137196 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
137197 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
137198 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
137199 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
137200 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
137201 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
137202 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
137203 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
137204 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
137205 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
137206 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
137207 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
137208 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
137209 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
137210 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
137211 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
137212 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
137213 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
137214 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
137215 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
137216 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
137217 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
137218 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
137219 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
137220 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
137221 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
137222 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
137223 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
137224 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
137225 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
137226 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
137227 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
137228 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
137229 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
137230 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
137231 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
137232 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
137233 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
137234 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
137235 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
137236 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
137237 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
137238 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
137239 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
137240 to those who say the challenge is not politically viable i suggest they go before the american people and try to defend the status quo then bear witness to the peoples appetite for change
137241 some of our greatest accomplishments as a nation have resulted from commitments to reach a goal that fell well beyond the next election the marshall plan social security the interstate highway system
137242 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
137243 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
137244 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
137245 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
137246 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
137247 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
137248 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
137249 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
137250 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
137251 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
137252 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
137253 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
137254 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
137255 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
137256 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
137257 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
137258 consumers can expect to see premiums rise slightly on top of the 2 3 increase seen in recent months
137259 er det ikke flott at en intens eu motstander ser at et forpliktende samarbeid kan brukes til noe han mener er fornuftig
137260 some have made a conscious decision to apply for jobs on a sideways move without promotion so they dont have to work for an academy
137261 the academy has been recruiting and there is not a shortage of staff but i do believe there is a shortage of stable staff
137262 this is a big change and the children will see a large number of new faces which is not always a good thing
137263 we are confident that we have the staff in place for september
137264 an academy is a chance to move forward and do something dynamic
137265 as much as im very sad to lose some very talented people we have more talented people coming in and people who wish to be there
137266 expanding product portfolio in support of global telecom operators providing iptv and broadband tv services
137267 this is to give us tailwinds for our expansion plans
137268 with over 25 telecom operators choosing the entone video gateway solution entone has emerged as a clear market leader
137269 we are especially excited about the entone product roadmap of media hub solutions developed to enable service operators to offer a new generation of television services that seamlessly blend broadcast television time shifted viewing place shifted viewing web based services and personal media

137273 i think every single email should be designed so that anyone viewing it through a preview pane with images blocked can see all the pertinent content i look at open rates every day and i can tell you that when the content is good and visible through the preview pane the open rates are much higher
137274 email is not a customer acquisition tool anymore it is a customer retention tool this is still marketing but you are sending something to people with whom you have a relationship and it is something they have asked for content
137275 right now it kind of looks like nothings happening but underneath there a lot of things are happening and i think weve got to be prepared
137276 we should send a letter to all those within a 25 mile radius and ask them to attend
137277 id be buying lobsters anyway but not as many if the prices werent this low
137278 frankly i dont care about the gambling i care about the jobs and the revenue
137279 rihanna see through shirt i think thats a nipple maybe
137280 and so addicted to vomiting that he suffers from potential heart failure and has lost quite a few of his teeth ive begged farley to get help but hed rather give me up than attend even one 12 step meeting
137281 you need to find people who can help you learn to help yourself
137282 intentional joy how to turn stress fear amp addiction into freedom
137283 farley is not only starving his body but his brain i believe the best solution would be for him to attend an inpatient eating disorder program he can google treatment programs in his area call them up and ask if they have a free or reduced cost bed
137284 there may not be a greater agony than watching someone you love slowly kill themselves and refuse to seek help

137286 this is a company that has been accused of murdering iraqi civilians

137288 a private cia essentially called total intelligence solutions and the man running total intelligence solutions is j cofer black hes a thirty year veteran of the central intelligence agency he also was the guy who ran the cias extraordinary rendition program the government sanctioned kidnap and torture program
137289 his thirty year cia career his network of contacts his knowledge that was gained through his work in the most sensitive areas of the united states government is now on the open market for hire
137290 you have a lot of traditional conservatives who are outraged at what they see as the degradation of the united states armed forces this has everything to do with the future of war making and global stability

137293 bradford is a pathfinder for the new diplomas and is another example of how we are again leading the field in improving the educational and training opportunities available to our young people over the next few years we will be rolling out an ambitious programme that will give youngsters more choice and i want every one of them to seize the chance to fulfil their full potential
137294 the best way to make the educational vision for bradford a reality is through confederations this brings the providers together to work flexibly to suit local circumstances
137295 we are pleased to support the bradford confederations as it is part of our ongoing commitment to putting the education of young people at the heart of everything we do it will give far more choice as to what training route they can take
137296 im sure they will do well together they are an ideal pairing really so i am looking forward to having them playing
137297 in other positions i think we look a bit under strength in all honesty but up front we look good
137298 i think that is how a marathon race is supposed to be run in both sides of the half way mark consistently like the water through the falls
137299 now is my turn and there is a lot of expectation from me in japan and especially fukuoka where i live
137300 before fukuoka i had never done a full marathon but i was in company of my friend macharia
137301 along the way macharia second in dubai marathon this year who was pacing me told me not to rush into the unknown he actually bridled my intentions
137302 when i was on my own i did not know whether to slow or increase the pace now i know when and how to win marathon races in record breaking time
137303 i admire haile because he breaks records which are usually a good challenge for me he breaks i break them
137304 and then if the opportunity to arrest and prosecute is there we will
137305 i think that if someones killed with one of these loyalist weapons then the british government is culpable because of their inactivity
137306 theres another question why arent they going after weapons now when they might have evidence relevant to a murder case i think the psni is left completely open to legal action on this
137307 it has been a long negotiation but finally an agreement has been reached
137308 i have started this season in england and i could have stayed there
137309 it wasnt a bad experience there and we worked well but i preferred to take this decision and i believe this is the right one
137310 my wish was to return to italy and i have taken the decision to end my relationship with manchester city in order to join a club where i will have more playing time
137311 i believe the number of teams which will be battling to avoid relegation will increase
137312 kaspars knows we intend to play good attractive football and he wants to be a part of it
137313 weve signed an international defender who has a great physical presence good pace and is comfortable on the ball hes an ambitious lad who wants to take his game forward
137314 the discovery has enormous implications for the large scale deployment of solar since it puts us on the doorstep of a cheap and easily manufactured storage mechanism the ease of implementation means that this discovery will have legs
137315 the simplicity of this process is amazing using common and affordable elements and a glass of water these chemists may have given us a future way to efficiently obtain oxygen by splitting water
137316 this is just the beginning the scientific community is really going to run with this
137317 many of todays church leaders have bought into the subtlety of pragmatism without recognizing the dangers it poses
137318 but because of his great love for us god who is rich in mercy made us alive with christ even when we were dead in transgressions it is by grace you have been saved and god raised us up with christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in christ jesus in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in christ jesus

137346 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
137347 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
137348 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients

137391 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
137392 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
137393 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
137394 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
137395 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
137396 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

137401 die menschen leiden weiter und wir d rfen sie nicht allein lassen

137411 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
137412 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
137413 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
137414 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
137415 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
137416 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
137417 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
137418 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
137419 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
137420 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
137421 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
137422 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
137423 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
137424 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
137425 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
137426 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
137427 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
137428 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
137429 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
137430 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
137431 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
137432 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
137433 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
137434 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
137435 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
137436 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
137437 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
137438 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
137439 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
137440 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

137448 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
137449 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
137450 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
137451 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
137452 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
137453 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
137454 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
137455 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
137456 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
137457 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
137458 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
137459 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
137460 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
137461 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
137462 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

137477 these things happen in football i cannot speak for roy and what he does all i will say is that i have total respect for everybody and everything at sunderland football club
137478 the season hasnt even started yet for fulham and already speculation is growing about my future at the club
137479 we have brought in new players including strikers and there has been talk that i may struggle to make it into the first team
137480 well i want to say here and now that i am more than happy to stay at fulham and fight for my place
137481 i proved last season when things werent going well and i wasnt playing that i was willing to knuckle down work even harder in training and that paid off with me getting back into the managers plans for the final weeks of the campaign
137482 now my aim is to start the coming season just like i did 12 months ago scoring goals and then the plan is to kick on and have a successful campaign
137483 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
137484 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
137485 and right now his intention is to go back to green bay and play football
137486 if they wont let me play in green bay let me play against you thats where i am

137673 aumentan las quiebras multimillonarias en el sector una inmobiliaria tras otra echa el cierre
137674 la quiebra multimillonaria del consorcio inmobiliario espa ol martinsa fadesa ha acabado por convencer hasta al ltimo dudoso de que el mercado inmobiliario espa ol va camino de estrellarse

137678 gas natural anunci ayer un acuerdo de compra del 45 de uni n fenosa a la constructora acs una vez aprobada la compra intentar lanzar una oferta por el resto de las acciones
137679 la espa ola acs dispuesta a ir al asalto de iberdrola
137680 al vender sus acciones en uni n fenosa el constructor puede concentrar sus esfuerzos en el n mero dos espa ol de la electricidad florentino p rez ha realizado un buen negocio vendiendo sus acciones a gas natural pero no por ello piensa renunciar al sector de la electricidad
137681 en espa a se est formando un nuevo gran consorcio
137682 en el mercado energ tico espa ol se est gestando un nuevo peso pesado y e on vuelve a ponerse inmediatamente a la defensiva en su nuevo mercado el mayor consorcio del gas del pa s gas natural se sumar mediante la adquisici n del proveedor el ctrico uni n fenosa a los grandes del sector endesa e iberdrola el mercado energ tico espa ol est muy concurrido desde hace a os gas natural hab a intentado comprar iberdrola en 2003 pero fracas frente a la oposici n de los rganos de protecci n de la competencia a continuaci n la empresa intent lo mismo con endesa en 2005 la oferta del consorcio fue superada en primer lugar por e on pero ste tuvo que darse por vencido frente a un grupo formado por el proveedor italiano enel y el consorcio espa ol de la construcci n acciona
137683 sin embargo con la adquisici n de uni n fenosa por parte de gas natural queda claramente relativizada la envergadura de la entrada de e on en el mercado espa ol ste seguramente seguir en movimiento en el futuro pr ximo puesto que el consorcio de la construcci n acs tambi n cuenta con una participaci n del 12 por ciento de iberdrola y aspira a ampliarla sin embargo resulta dudoso que acs pueda emplear en este sentido lo que obtenga por la venta de uni n fenosa

137691 el amor de italia por el viejo continente parece que se est enfriando progresivamente la sospecha declarada del gobierno italiano es que hay quien est tramando contra el bel paese berlusconiano el resultado es una especie de pulso permanente entre la ue y roma desde que el centro derecha ha vuelto al poder en italia se advierte una cierta desconfianza rec proca con el gobierno de prodi los contrastes eran sobre todo de car cter econ mico mientras que ahora se registran en un plano m s delicado y resbaladizo porque ponen en tela de juicio el nivel de democracia de italia a veces las cr ticas revelan una buena tasa de prejuicios y son sugeridas e infladas por sectores de la izquierda que enarbolan el antiberlusconismo como una bandera de libertad sin embargo liquidar as el problema ser a de miopes tambi n en el gobierno italiano existen prejuicios contra europa mientras que en la oposici n parece como si la cuarentena italiana fuese una confirmaci n del mal representado por el cavaliere sin embargo de tensi n en tensi n se pierde la dimensi n europea de los problemas se practica una autarqu a legislativa que tiene como nico juez y punto de referencia el consenso electoral
137692 pocos parecen conscientes de que un enfrentamiento semejante puede deslegitimar a europa y debilita sobre todo a italia dilatando la percepci n de su anomal a por eso conviene anclarse a la ue a pesar de las evidentes dificultades y tratar de recomponer desgarros pol ticos y al mismo tiempo culturales hijos de estereotipos inaceptables pero tambi n de opciones discutibles que no se pueden defender solamente con la idea del complot anti italiano de lo contrario se responde a una imagen falsa de italia con lugares comunes especulares
137693 las negociaciones de ltima oportunidad se han reanudado en la organizaci n mundial del comercio pero incluso antes de que estas se emprendan formalmente el presidente de la rep blica ha lanzado una carga preventiva contra el comisario europeo mandelson acusado de liquidar los intereses de la europa agr cola por un plato de lentejas industriales existe evidentemente un discurso presidencial bien estudiado que consiste en repetir que europa definitivamente no sabe defenderse en la mundializaci n
137694 el mandato de ehud olmert al frente del gobierno israel termina igual que empez con un tufillo a esc ndalo llegado al poder en marzo de 2006 a ra z del accidente cerebral de ariel sharon el antiguo alcalde de jerusal n fue puesto en entredicho algunos meses despu s por su manera de conducir la guerra del l bano considerada calamitosa vilipendiado por la opini n p blica y los medios de comunicaci n s lo pudo sobrevivir gracias al esperp ntico benjamin netanyahu el l der del likud tenido por todos como ganador en caso de dimisi n forzada y de elecciones anticipadas desde ese momento olmert no ha dejado de ser blanco de las cr ticas y de las acusaciones de corrupci n

137696 en el sentido de una pol tica limpia ha sido un paso necesario
137697 los jefes de gobierno se suceden con cada vez m s rapidez y las remodelaciones de gobierno son cada vez m s intensas la desestabilizaci n del sistema pol tico est adquiriendo rasgos absurdos y extremadamente peligrosos gobernar y actuar a largo plazo es pr cticamente imposible no sorprende que el hast o pol tico general de muchos israel es se haya convertido en un hast o frente al estado
137698 la inminente salida de l der israel crea nuevos problemas

137700 la salida de escena de olmert podr a congelar las negociaciones con anp e incluso acercar la hip tesis de un ataque contra ir n por algo uno de sus posibles sucesores y candidato en las primarias el actual ministro de transportes sa l mofaz uno de los halcones de kadima ha pedido inmediatamente bloquear cualquier hip tesis de acuerdo con los palestinos en cuanto a la favorita para la sucesi n la ministra de exteriores tizpi livni que mantiene ptimas relaciones con los servicios de seguridad y con las jerarqu as militares instituciones decisivas en el circuito de poder israel si ganara formar a un gobierno de unidad nacional con los laboristas de barak y con el likud de netanyahu esta f rmula se impone siempre en israel cuando la inestabilidad interior pone en peligro el sistema pol tico y cuando se perfilan retos exteriores que anuncian un conflicto b lico de amplio alcance como podr a ser el conflicto con ir n destinado a ensancharse a todo el oriente pr ximo mucho depender de como kadima salga de las primarias de septiembre y en segundo orden de las decisiones del partido laborista de barak en todo caso el oto o israel y no s lo israel corre peligro de ser muy cliente

137706 alfresco labs 3 is the first product to implement the sharepoint protocol and provides the same ease of use of sharepoint while giving companies the freedom of choice in their hardware database operating system application server and portal products
137707 alfresco labs users get a content management and collaboration tool that is integrated with microsoft sharepoint and office it lowers overall it costs and increases return on existing investments

137710 microsoft provided much better documentation due to the demands of the european union
137711 microsoft released the sharepoint protocol as part of its compliance with the eus antitrust decision of march 24 2004 alfresco also is the first ecm system to implement the microsoft office protocols as a compatible server

137846 it was through our appreciation of that that we eventually got together and formed the divorcees
137847 i grew up in a small town in new brunswick called fredericton an appreciation for country music was woven through every generation you listened to a lot of different styles of music but there was always country in your collection
137848 new brunswicks very much steeped in that style of music
137849 we seem to have somehow crossed some genres and people from a variety of backgrounds seem to be comfortable with what were doing
137850 i think traditional country in its essence is one of those styles that just communicates so easily to people you get it right away theres something i think that bluntness that simplicity to it that communicates to people that are fans of rock n roll as well as country
137851 nashville likes to play it safe and i dont blame them because safe means that theyre gonna survive but the problem sometimes with the nashville model of country is that its just that its only the nashville model
137852 what ends up happening with the nashville model is you kind of lose that sense of geography and you lose that sense of flavour thats maybe why youre seeing the canadian country music scene start to flourish in a big way however i preface that by saying theres always room for both
137853 you dont always have to play it safe sometimes its ok to get your blood boiling a little bit
137854 the rumors about her health are dramatic overstated and untrue
137855 at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels
137856 kids are something jake and reese discussed very early on
137857 he made it clear that he definitely wants to have children he just wanted to make sure reese would be willing too before he allowed himself to get serious with her
137858 never be able to forget seeing sean being murdered by those thugs
137859 i still cant believe what has happened and i am struggling to come to terms with losing sean
137860 our child will never get to meet their own father
137861 i am asking anyone who has information that can help bring these cowards to justice to tell police what they know
137862 sean was loved by his nana brother sister and i and he was close to all of us
137863 we are all distraught at what has happened and i want the people responsible to be caught so that i can lay my son to rest in peace
137864 if they have any conscience whatsoever then they should hand themselves in
137865 this was a brutal and callous attack which has traumatised a family and left an unborn child without a father

137870 moreover a month ago obama explicitly claimed without evidence that the republicans will attack him on racial grounds the choice is clear most of all we can choose between hope and fear it is going to be very difficult for republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black it seems clear therefore that the race card has become a permanent part of obamas hand a wild card to be played whenever the spirit or the circumstances so moves him

137877 possibly the most noteworthy treatment that i have had that has truly changed my entire quality of life has been the complete elimination of pain brought about by the multiple sclerosis the entire right side of my body suffered from deep pains where my muscles and tendons just plain hurt i felt like i had played an entire football game getting hit exclusively on the right side of my body talking to other people suffering from ms they also share similar stories of their pains well dr chernoff talked to me about a treatment she felt confident would work the treatment is photon stimulator color therapy which i like because it is completely non intrusive to the body i was skeptical at first but not 15 minutes following the treatment i looked at my wife and said its gone the pain is totally gone i have felt no pain since the color therapy and that has been more than three months now

137885 reluctantly signed that agreement without ever coming to the negotiations
137886 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself its an invented story and no one ought to believe it

137896 mclaren will most definitely keep kovalainen if he continues to work for the team the way he has been doing

137898 i would never want to play such a role i would rather finish fifth or sixth with a renault than fourth or fifth with mclaren

137922 the presentation further noted the work done by government over the years including the creation of fiscal space which affords the country the resources to manage the current adverse economic environment
137923 the meeting further reiterated the importance of communities involvement in the fight against crime and called upon all south africans to do everything practically and legally possible to stem the tide against crime

137928 i felt like i was nine feet tall and could go bear hunting with a switch
137929 damn youd have to get in line to get in trouble in that crowd
137930 we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
137931 i think people for some reason think hes lazy and a bad teammate and that he doesnt care
137932 hes none of the above does he do some goofy things absolutely he does do some goofy things but as far as preparation and knowing the game and wanting to win theres no way you put up those numbers year in and year out unless youre a special talent and work at it and he does both
137933 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
137934 hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
137935 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
137936 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
137937 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
137938 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
137939 ive had some colorful personalities on my clubs like david wells and jimmy leyritz if you feel somebodys going to help your club youve got to find a way to make it work and thats my job its a challenge but i look forward to it
137940 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them

137953 weve had a number of discussions with our supporters groups over the summer months and this was clearly an area for reassessment were really pleased with the new products and service that will be on offer for the forthcoming season
137954 with the incredible demand for tickets next season weve anticipated demand and introduced new kiosks and mobile units around the ground
137955 the blue and white bar has long been a favourite with our fans and were delighted with the end result
137956 catering plays a significant role in the matchday experience and were confident the rangers supporters will embrace the changes next season

137968 the uj choir won this section by a staggering 96 votes
137969 this section was voted for by the audience and the uj choir was definitely the firm favourite
137970 competition was stiff with choirs from denmark italy india and cuba
137971 with three gold awards two silver awards and 19 sell out performances the uj choir have shown that they are able to successfully compete in both the western and traditional choral music fields

137983 we know that many patients choose not to complete their course of medication but this study reveals a different type of problem patients who for whatever reason take their medicines incorrectly
137984 our pharmacists have reported many instances where patients have been confused by their medicines
137985 one patient set out a range of medicines and described the frequency and dosage for each
137986 it turns out that for several months she had been taking a sleeping pill first thing in the morning
137987 when the pharmacist asked him to demonstrate the problem became clear he wasnt removing the cap
137988 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
137989 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different

137995 it is certainly an agreement which isnt painless for either side
137996 the agreement is certainly only justifiable in view of its long term and the one time performance based payment it also requires that the additional costs be compensated for through increased productivity
137997 from an investors point of view this comes as a very pleasant surprise
137998 he came in he worked and he seemed very calm about it all and i thought his behaviour was impeccable
137999 he was going to west brom but went to rangers at the last minute but they paid a cost for coming in that late because the price then went up
138000 i brought him here because hes a young centre half and i think hes going to get better however the agenda here has changed

138008 theres no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of native americans as well as other persons of color in this country weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for
138009 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
138010 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
138011 the biggest problem that we have in terms of race relations i think is dealing with the legacy of past discrimination which has resulted in extreme disparities in terms of poverty in terms of wealth and in terms of income our inner cities are a legacy of what happened in the past and the question is less assigning blame or rooting out active racism because thats not the reason that those inner cities are in such bad shape but rather figuring out are we willing to make the investments to deal with that past history so we can move forward to a brighter future and that involves investing in early childhood education fixing the schools in those communities being willing to work in terms of job retraining and those are serious investments
138012 does barack obama believe its time for america to apologize to al qaida

138015 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
138016 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
138017 its good you should read it go and buy it

138019 you had the buddha zen master guy in spring training reading and life is good dont worry be happy and it just looked like he was poised to have a monster season physically he worked his butt off
138020 at the end of the day youre taking the field with a guy who doesnt want to play with you doesnt want to be there doesnt want to obviously effort wise is just not there and thats disheartening and disappointing
138021 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
138022 the red sox did the same with guys like nomar garciaparra and pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here

138024 brenda was holding onto him and when the tornado came through my father ran to get to the both of them
138025 from what i gather the baby was pulled out of her arms and she held onto him long enough so that he didnt get thrown around
138026 as soon as i started high school football i always wanted to play in the shrine game
138027 i think ive had a conversation with everyone on the team we all pretty much checked our egos and our rivalries at the door were all team new hampshire
138028 when its time to work its time to work but when were not practicing its been a lot of fun
138029 it was tempting to line him up in front of londonderry running back alex theodhosi and just let him clear a path but hes a true lineman we have a ton of skill kids so we knew we had him in the right place
138030 they asked me where i wanted to play and i told them it didnt really matter
138031 if they feel i can help the team more from that position guard thats fine
138032 they gave us a speech we watched a video took a tour
138033 originally they werent going to let us visit with the patients i guess because of the new privacy laws but a group of eight asked if we could see the patients and we went with a shrine official im sure there were more who wanted to go who couldnt
138034 none of them the patients spoke english so there was a definite language barrier an interpreter introduced us but i dont think they really understood who we were
138035 after that trip i felt honored to play to be a part of this game its amazing how the hospital changes these peoples lives at no cost that we can help improve their lives is incredible
138036 he runs downhill very well hes a hybrid he runs with power and finesse
138037 hes not the biggest fastest or strongest kid but hes a hard worker if he were as big as lane and i people would be knocking on his door
138038 the disappointing thing is we wont meet after the game

138046 for the first time we have been able to demonstrate that the pattern of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere through decomposition is governed by the same properties everywhere from the arctic circle to tropical rain forests
138047 this provides a mathematical way of describing a critical natural process
138048 one of the key findings of this study is that microbes can adapt and do fairly well in a nutrient poor environment
138049 when their diet is lacking in nitrogen microbes tend to react by releasing more carbon dioxide into the air and taking in less mineral nitrogen from the soil so plants can get the much needed mineralized nitrogen earlier in the decomposition process from the fallen organic matter
138050 the same way as waste vapour is drawn out of this material to make hikers more comfortable to less prone to hypothermia so it is able to breathe oxygen into our fuel cell and into contact with the conductive plastic
138051 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
138052 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable
138053 the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
138054 the small amounts of carbon monoxide that are always present in exhausts from petrol engines are a real problem for fuel cells because the platinum catalyst is slowly poisoned eventually destroying the cell

138059 countries with dollar denominated assets need to cooperate to find a transition path that weans the united states from foreign credit and foreign oil while at the same time moves emerging economies away from excessive export oriented dependence on us consumption
138060 it also will require expanded effort to find additional options to increase the capacities of middle east energy exporting countries to absorb petrodollar inflows through investment in appropriate forms of human and physical capital
138061 high impact firms are important to new hampshires economic growth and development
138062 state policy makers would be wise to consider how their policies can encourage such firms
138063 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
138064 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
138065 coach frey has devoted his life to helping others through teaching and coaching he is the nicest man i have ever met and a fun person to be around he is a great coach and an even better human being
138066 ive enjoyed my time here and ive been able to make a lot of accomplishments
138067 its time to move on to another direction and another chapter in life
138068 i think there was a certain pressure on him here and i wish him well
138069 i know he was trying hard to make it work its been very hard for him
138070 he had tough shoes to fill when skip sullivan left
138071 its tough to replace someone like that but he did it
138072 its with most of his information that well go forward
138073 its too bad he wont be here to see those buildings done
138074 obviously ive very much enjoyed working under the leadership of chief lipe
138075 he breaks on the ball well and is a great leader
138076 weve received a tremendous amount of interest from potential tenants
138077 i just want to make sure we have the right mix
138078 id say 99 5 percent of the people here are great
138079 i just met him yesterday but i told him id come back to say goodbye
138080 we planned this trip together but she didnt make it
138081 then i will come back here fix anything that needs fixing and replenish my supplies then im heading south providing there are no hurricanes heading up the east coast if there are im going down the st lawrence river
138082 i am going to be sending e mails to people to let them know about my trip
138083 by doing that it allowed me to get an unlimited license we didnt have radar back then no radios and thats when you had to be a real pilot you needed to know every rock and reef we had the last steam tug in the harbor
138084 its history a historic bridge of course in the winter you earn your money here

138088 i dont move unless i know i have a five day window
138089 i am a devout coward i have been in some truly dangerous conditions
138090 you should not be jumping to conclusions about this case
138091 i guarantee this case is nothing like what has been reported so far
138092 she wants to resolve the charges that were brought against her as quickly as possible because she is innocent
138093 let our hair down and have some fun prior to deployment
138094 this was a chance for them to relax a little but also get the families involved
138095 it has brought our family a little bit closer together
138096 shes the kind of lady that will help out some of the other wives
138097 but ive been trying to stay normal for him its hard but ive been trying
138098 its really nice because they offer so much to us and it helps just to know i have someone to call
138099 they are heading over with about 25 people from another unit
138100 they are going with the 128th air refueling wing out of wisconsin about a week or so ago they retuned from fort bliss in texas where they received training for our group this is the first time that any of them have been to afghanistan
138101 the perception is theres a lot of land here fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it were down to 60 acres
138102 i was questioned by the feds and i sung like a canary
138103 first of all i never watch the jon stewart show
138104 i didnt ride in the hummer i dont even know who owned the hummer
138105 preservation is recycling on a large scale and we can reduce our impact on the environment and save energy by adaptively reusing buildings and their durable historic materials rather than carting them to the landfill
138106 anything we raise from the fair is money we can use to spend on equipment
138107 we spend it on anything we didnt foresee in the budget
138108 we also continuously save money from the fair to make larger purchases
138109 the fire department association has participated in the purchase of trucks and safety equipment
138110 weve put approximately 80 000 into the truck that is going to be purchased next year
138111 the fire department has never considered itself two different associations
138112 if you dont have much pitching the games become marathons we have plenty of arms i think we have a deeper staff than most teams from what ive seen
138113 if you have four good starters and at least a couple of good relievers youre in pretty good shape you have to have relievers you have confidence in who can throw strikes the seventh eighth and ninth innings tend to be where games are won
138114 the seedings dont mean much especially in the first games
138115 the very troubling granting of a treasury ofac license to a little league team to travel to cuba
138116 id say 99 5 percent of the people here are great
138117 i just met him yesterday but i told him id come back to say goodbye
138118 we planned this trip together but she didnt make it

138127 i am a devout coward i have been in some truly dangerous conditions
138128 but this is my first year actually riding in it its just one more way to give back
138129 but there are so many people i know who are affected by cancer and its worth it knowing that you helped even one person ill keep riding until we find a cure for this dreaded disease that affects every family
138130 its a cause we can get behind for a variety of reasons
138131 there is so much support from volunteers and sponsors its incredibly well run and an efficient fund raiser
138132 you feel it every minute you ride the magnitude of the event on so many levels is amazing
138133 an enchanting story of faith and family that is as enlightening as it is encouraging
138134 the most riveting thought provoking book ive read in years

138139 in five years now the sky has not fallen the earth has not opened to swallow us all up and more to the point thousands and thousands of good people contributing members of our society are able to make free decisions about their personal future and we ought to seek to affirm that every chance we can
138140 its extremely important if something happened to one of us shed always be taken care of
138141 now new yorkers can drive across the border to a neighboring state and get a marriage license that will be recognized as fully legal and valid here at home
138142 this is a clarion call for the rest of the nation on the dangers of this radical social experiment and also the essential need for a federal marriage amendment to clearly define marriage as the union of one man and one woman
138143 same sex marriage is a social experiment and it certainly will have an impact on the culture particularly the children where we already see that in massachusetts children are being educated on the efficacy of same sex marriage and the irrelevance of fatherhood and motherhood

138147 the burden of credit card debt is felt in every state across america with devastating impact on consumers and communities everywhere
138148 unfair practices by credit card companies are fueling these high debt levels
138149 consumers are victims of a range of abuses such as doubling and tripling interest rates applying higher interest rates retroactively to outstanding balances imposing exorbitant penalty fees and requiring binding mandatory arbitration clauses
138150 new hampshire is among the strongest states in fostering an environment where residents can build and retain wealth across all five asset areas of the 2007 2008 assets and opportunity scorecard
138151 the state earned an overall a grade on the scorecard as well as in all five indexes financial security business development home ownership health care and education
138152 more than anywhere else in the country workers in new hampshire are covered by employer sponsored health insurance no 1 an important asset protection
138153 the state boasts strong student achievement third in eighth grade reading proficiency 12th in eighth grade math proficiency as well as post secondary education attainment 15th in two year college degrees 11th in four year college degrees
138154 however among these laudable achievements are signs that not everyone is prospering
138155 comparably high debt suggests that residents may be living beyond their means
138156 across the five areas of assets in the 2007 2008 assets and opportunity scorecard maines residents are consistently able to build and retain assets better than in most other states
138157 households enjoy higher net worth ranked 13th among the states more small business ownership ninth and lower debt third in median installment debt 15th in median mortgage debt and 28th in median credit card debt than most other americans
138158 the state is 45th in asset poverty by gender households headed by women are more than twice as likely to be asset poor have net worth insufficient to subsist above the federal poverty level for three months in the absence of income than male headed households 26 percent of households headed by women versus 11 percent of households headed by men
138159 a poor ranking in home ownership by race 41st reveals a large difference in the home ownership rates of whites 73 percent and minorities 43 percent
138160 while business ownership among women 12th african americans seventh and hispanics third is better than in most states the value of those businesses lag 46th in value of women owned businesses 19th in african american owned businesses and 33rd in hispanic owned businesses
138161 business ownership is the second largest component of american net worth and often the path by which families move solidly into the middle class
138162 cfed created our scorecard so that states can see how they compare on the things most closely tied to their citizens economic well being and their officials can more clearly see where they might want to take action on issues like debt savings home and business ownership poverty or even health care insurance or job preparation via education
138163 the numbers on debt are particularly troublesome not just because credit card debt is so heavy and widespread but also because they signify a real drain on wealth that negatively affects a households ability to build assets

138166 it makes sense of course that the peninsula wouldnt remain undiscovered for long no matter how much we might wish to keep it to ourselves
138167 the countrys best beaches are here after all and just offshore is the worlds second longest barrier reef after australias

138175 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
138176 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong

138179 mr bateman said the new location was no more than 10 minutes drive away
138180 it was nice to get back to someone this close to the area
138181 matt and i have had a knack for promoting shows this is the big show
138182 i have kids its just a good gut check things could be a lot worse it makes me realize how fortunate i am
138183 thats the main reason why i keep doing it its for a great cause
138184 you usually see it in the elderly or older adults
138185 she called and asked me if i was interested in filling out an application for rock for life
138186 we have to authorize and approve everything that is spent
138187 i was wondering what was going to happen with the baby waiting to see if he moved
138188 he comes in and says theres no easy way to tell you this but your son maybe has some kind of heart defect
138189 they werent sure if it was a hole in his heart or what but there was blood and fluid all around his heart
138190 i was actually showing what was wrong with the baby because he couldnt show it
138191 but the doctor told him youre going in that room because your baby is going to have a 25 percent chance of making it out of that room alive he said it didnt look good and he wasnt going to sugar coat it for us
138192 but i said no my baby will be fine i felt it
138193 i knew as soon as they cut him out that he was going to make it
138194 i stayed at allegheny general and they said they would call when the surgery was over
138195 it seemed like eternity but they called and said he was out of surgery that he was doing better
138196 and from there it was just a matter of him getting bigger and stronger
138197 hes five months old and he should be doing more than hes doing
138198 i dont ever want to think hes perfect because i dont know whats going to happen right now hes doing well
138199 were just going day by day we never know whats going to happen or whats going to come our way
138200 doctors have told me i could drop dead at any minute
138201 i cant walk more than a few steps without getting out of breath and a few months ago i developed type 2 diabetes
138202 we are sad and grieving but we are not despairing because we know hes in heaven and we will see him again
138203 in memory of zachary ryan harle 4 9 91 to 7 31 07 loved and was loved by friends and family life is good eternal life is better
138204 zach was very much about god family and friends in that order
138205 shes slowed down a lot and doesnt get out as much
138206 but she still has a good sense of humor and is a joy to be around
138207 we want to create a safety net by vaccinating as many people as we can so that infants and young children who cant be vaccinated will still be protected from it
138208 its a difficult diagnosis and is often misdiagnosed for two or three times as bronchitis or something else
138209 these are large important sectors of greenhouse gas emissions from the united states
138210 and they are emissions that can be controlled and as yet are entirely unregulated by epa
138211 epa has been responsive to the petition and we will continue to move forward in the regulating process
138212 these states would find it more beneficial to spend their time lobbying members of congress to pass responsible environmental legislation
138213 here in oregon we are ready to take the necessary steps to protect our planet from global warming but the federal government continues to sidestep the issue with red tape and bureaucratic delay
138214 yet again the bush administration epa is ignoring its duty to combat pollution if we are serious about fighting climate change we must limit emissions from our transportation and commercial sectors
138215 not the holes so much but where the pavements all broken up into cracks
138216 we went out there as a heads up from local citizens
138217 the path has suffered serious deterioration primarily due to tree roots heaving and breaking the pavement
138218 in some places holes in the pavement have been created this is a very unsafe situation for pedestrians as well as bicyclists particularly at night as the path is not lighted
138219 it needed some attention and odot performed valiantly to get it done
138220 its great when multi agencies work together to make a difference
138221 its embarrassing to me that a state office is using these kind of practices to select a professional who goes out in the name of the state of oregon to audit records
138222 i asked one witness why is it that everyone is so young and i didnt really get answer im assuming its because you want people who dont have experience who will follow orders like lemmings and not question it
138223 it sounds as though youre having to send people out begging to see documents that are by law shown to them and theyre entitled to
138224 it sounds like thats their primary job qualification it sounds like theyre selling something instead of auditing documents
138225 well be taking a real hard look at our procedures and process for hiring to make sure that we are abiding by not only the letter of the law but the spirit of the law
138226 when youre consistently passed over for substantially younger candidates with zero relevant work experience zero relevant life experience and you bring a wealth of credentials and experience to the table thats age discrimination
138227 not one of the witnesses said anything that there is overt discrimination
138228 i was a little nervous but i felt more relieved when dari carter was on second
138229 these are just preliminary games so everybodys nice and relaxed
138230 sure we pull pitchers out rest pitchers rest players yeah it makes a big difference a wins nice though
138231 if you think about it even though these games dont count for bracket play or whatever you still want to play hard
138232 its hard to say but if you think about it bracket play is much more up if you know youre going to go to the next level pool play is more chill
138233 at least as far as momentum in that game we started off slow and now were moving forward in the game
138234 so now hopefully we can carry that momentum forward into tomorrows play i anticipate these girls will do really well
138235 the process for us picking teams is we are not allowed to pick an all star team before may 1
138236 pandooora ti porter al palazzo ti mostrer il mio caaaaaa ro amato genitor pandooooora ti porter in giardino e mi farai un poooo chino di coccole damor ma tu che ca sa vuoi ma vai a far ti bella sei una tro vatella che casa vuoi
138237 when he was attacking him he was calm there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot
138238 the victim didnt do anything to provoke the guy the guy just took a knife out and stabbed him started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
138239 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
138240 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
138241 were better off than when we started because we have got ahead of drogheda in the pecking order
138242 we have a run of games now starting with shamrock rovers which we can win and well see where we are in couple of weeks
138243 everyone still has to play everyone else at the top and that could work to our advantage
138244 we are playing well at the minute and confidence is high but we have to keep winning
138245 ich trage die verantwortung daf r dass der staat genug geld hat seine rechnungen zu bezahlen
138246 ich h tte auch informiert werden sollen statt dass ich isoliert werde und fehlinformationen erhalte
138247 both players have picked up knocks and i dont think they will be in the starting line up
138248 i have been impressed with both of them and they would be in my starting eleven if they were injury free
138249 even if both were in a position to start they couldnt complete 90 minutes so it isnt looking good
138250 if we can replicate the way we played in the first half against belgium i think we have a great chance of making it difficult for them
138251 we perhaps tired a little in the second half of that game and made a few changes which affected the overall pattern of the match
138252 belgium had nothing to lose so they came at us but we deserved to be in the final and now that we are here we want to win it
138253 chile are a quality team and as well as having them watched we have been receiving a briefing from wales coach brian flynn who was highly complementary of their ability
138254 they are technically gifted players and difficult to determine the shape they play because they rotate so much which is typical of the south american style
138255 there is fantastic support for us and the boys are eager to do themselves and northern ireland proud
138256 the loss of martin and the debate surrounding the red card suffered by dan have certainly given us plenty of food for thought going into this game but you can take it from me that we are very focussed now on making it into the quarter finals
138257 aside from that dublin result wexford have performed well and they have a lot of good individual players
138258 while its encouraging that we have been getting scores its a fact that we have been conceding rather too much we will need to keep the brakes on the wexford forward line
138259 i am thrilled drumbo park is now open for business especially as this project has taken some years to come to fruition
138260 drumbo has excellent facilities and will appeal to those who perhaps havent enjoyed the fun and excitement of greyhound racing before for instance the likes of corporate entertainment social gatherings and parties or sporting club outings
138261 traditional fans of greyhound racing will view some exciting races while enjoying a flutter or two with the bookmakers and we will also be showing live racing coverage from two of irelands leading tracks shelbourne park and harolds cross
138262 we were supposed to have a soft opening night but it hasnt turned out that way we should see some very high class racing
138263 its vastly improved and puts northern ireland in the premier league of greyhound racing
138264 we are now on par with the likes of shelbourne and dundalk
138265 we only live up the road and we were the first two in through the door its amazing what has been done here we used to come down to the old track and we cant believe the difference it looks totally brilliant
138266 weve managed to save a bit of money since its been closed so well be putting on a few bets
138267 the hospitality suite is of a very high standard it should be a great night
138268 its terrific we race greyhounds and we hope to have one in on saturdays races this will save us a lot of money in petrol because weve been having to drive to the likes of lifford and dundalk to race our dogs
138269 there are a lot of good runners out there but im hoping my dog will do well i think this venue will do well i cant believe the size of it when we used to come here it was just a wee pokey place we are very much impressed by it all well definitely be placing a few bets
138270 it looks lovely theres a really big change there was nothing wrong with the old track but this is just great its very impressive indeed
138271 wir wollen keine superstars heranz chten sondern die jungen leute sportlich und schulisch auf einen m glichen college besuch vorbereiten
138272 were coming off the back of that disappointing ulster final defeat by armagh and its not going to be easy but i have been impressed by the attitude of the boys this week they are prepared to roll their sleeves up and get stuck in again
138273 we missed chances against armagh and that cost us but we still have quality players in our side and we are prepared to stand up and be counted at croke park
138274 kildare have not managed to get past the second round of the qualifiers in the past so it would obviously be a bonus to make it into the last eight
138275 fermanagh are a good side irrespective of their ulster final defeat by armagh they have a lot of good players in the side they are fit and they blend well together they will like the wide open spaces of croke park
138276 obviously being on the ryder cup team is graemes main priority this year but he would be delighted to represent ireland at the world cup
138277 its not definite that padraig wont play but we should know in a couple of weeks what the position is
138278 obviously we feel we owe them one but its going to be very tough they have a lot of very experienced players still in their side
138279 these guys and the rest of the players in the current team want to see the tables turned on mayo
138280 we are taking what we believe to be the positives from our connacht final defeat into tomorrows game
138281 we felt we played fairly well against galway and we know that we can build on this while obviously you would like to be going straight into the quarter finals as provincial champions we still feel we can get there this week end
138282 wir wollen das thema liebeskummer enttabuisieren und den betroffenen die scham nehmen dar ber zu reden
138283 es ist ein intimer leidensprozess der nicht mit pauschalratschl gen gemildert werden kann
138284 i had this crazy one where i was swimming at this amazing rate and everything was just flying just super fast and it was so real im thinking am i supposed to put this into practice in training
138285 nobody in the world could have prepared more than he has
138286 i think the key for me is to just relax more the way i was in dublin in 2003 when i just arrived after dong exams and got in and performed and got a silver medal that was short course and im a much better long course swimmer
138287 although its going to be hard i just have to forget that its beijing and treat like any other meet
138288 back in 2004 i took very badly that i didnt make it to athens and for a while i didnt have the drive to go and give everything in practice and that probably lasted a year where i just enjoyed myself
138289 but then about three or four months before the commonwealth games i decided to work hard and i went to melbourne and finished fifth again and equalled michael williamsons irish record
138290 having trained so little and done a 2 14 i knew then that i had to really start pushing hard again but even at that i havent trained or been so focused or so obsessed with the sport as i have over the past 12 months its not being obsessed in a bad way but ive looked so much more deeply into the sport and into every aspect
138291 after getting the a time last year for beijing the past 12 months have just all been about the olympics i havent had a proper rest before a meet so i know when i go to beijing if i swim my race im going to be flying
138292 im 27 and getting faster and there is so much more to come i thought beijing might be the end for me but if i do well i really have to think about going to the commonwealth games in two years time and in between there are euros and worlds
138293 im very thankful that im here and still fulfiling my potential and to be honest in terms of funding if it wasnt for my mum and dad i wouldnt be nowhere they have sacrificed a lot and i couldnt have done it without them
138294 in was sitting there watching nbc who gave the big build up for hansen and im wondering if hell get close to the world record but then at the final turn he got burned and the commentator is going crazy
138295 but in swimming you just never know because it is so technical and everything just has to come together
138296 ive set irish records in the 100m breast and 200 im and i havent even been rested so bring on beijing and the best in the world because ill be ready
138297 in those days i made enough money to give me the impression that life would be easy at the top but i spent a lot also to fuel my standard of living and believe it or not i got such a buzz out of it i havent felt the same since until i entered the world of irish motorcycle road racing
138298 i would love to win a race at the ulster
138299 its an old chestnut that the ulster grand prix at dundrod is a riders race but truly thats what it is there are corners and bends that you dont see anywhere else and i regard it as a mini tt
138300 ive already won over the circuit when i was successful at the dundrod 150 in 2006 after having raced at the north west 200 which was my first irish road race in 2005
138301 you might say that i was smitten by the bug when riding at the north west and i have been back every year loving the smell of the excitement which is generated both by the bikes and the masses of people who follow ulster road racing
138302 people elsewhere dont realise that road racing is a national obsession as far as northern ireland and even ireland is concerned
138303 but if it is a dry day then the racing can be as good as anywhere in the world i believe that six or seven riders can win and i would name guy martin bruce anstey cameron donald ian lougher john mcguinness ian hutchinson and ryan farquhar in that bunch
138304 when you read that list as its set in front of you you will have some idea as to the task there is in beating these riders they all have loads of experience round the track and theres no way they will ease up and give you a chance but thats the way it should be and i wouldnt have it any other way
138305 if i didnt think i could win a race at the ulster then i wouldnt go there youve got to be positive and thats the way to tackle it i was third in the first 600 race last year and i missed out because the second race was abandoned
138306 i cant say enough about the fans for they are much more tuned in than they are in england or even scotland they know exactly what a rider can do and they are not easily fooled in fact the fans make it and thats why i love to race here
138307 and im just glad hes not racing on the roads or i would have to take up something else
138308 they werent more popular either the thing is that in the us they were but not in the rest of the world
138309 citizens of the ussr are equal before the law without distinction of origin social or property status race or nationality sex education language attitude to religion type and nature of occupation domicile or other status

138311 the only way to really try to find out if he did or not is to read the scriptures pray about it and pay attention to feelings that you may have about it
138312 but 28 years after his death in an interview being broadcast for the first time he claims that on the contrary he hoped to encourage people to focus on the christian faith
138313 if the beatles get on the side of christ which they always were and let people know that then maybe the churches wont be full but therell be a lot of christians dancing in the dance halls whatever they celebrate god and christ i dont think it matters as long as theyre aware of him and his message
138314 imagine theres no heaven its easy if you try no hell below us above us only sky
138315 i dont believe in beatles i just believe in me
138316 there he fell headlong his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out
138317 bigger than me yeah but ive always been told that size doesnt matter right
138318 christianity will go it will vanish and shrink i do not know what will go first rock n roll or christianity were more popular than jesus now jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary
138319 you know what man common sense this jesus guy is where its at man
138320 jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary its them twisting it that ruins it for me
138321 i believe in god but not as one thing not as an old man in the sky i believe that what people call god is something in all of us i believe that what jesus and mohammed and buddha and all the rest said was right its just that the translations have gone wrong
138322 you gotta serve yourself aint nobody gonna do it for you
138323 i knew a guy who knew a guy who said he knew a guy who saw jesus
138324 not even the writers of the gospels actually knew the guy

138535 the air yeezy is inspired by kanyes love for high top designer shoes drafting from the collar molding seen in the air jordan v and featuring a thin midfoot strap hardly meant for support while originally conceptualized atop a dunk midsole the final version of the yeezy features the familiar shared tooling from the jordan iii and air revolution which most recently was also featured on jordan brands spizike and a lesser known model that deservedly flew under the radar the flight 48 its also the bulkiness of the shoes tongue that stands out most with west always opting to pop the tongue and leave the waxed laces loosely tied an ode to his tour the models outsole also actually glows in the dark as similar to a common glow stick if the shoe is held near light the familiar green glowing hue will radiate afterwards out from under the shoe this black glow colorway features a ridiculously high quality full grain leather along the heel quarter with rich suede making up the toe and midfoot overlays and patent leather highlighting the dominant midfoot strap

138573 the australian government has formed the view that the safeguards agreement is a positive step which will strengthen nuclear non proliferation efforts and is consistent with the non proliferation objectives of the nuclear non proliferation treaty
138574 it has no effect nor does it require a change to the australian labor party s long standing approach of not exporting uranium to a country thats not a party to the npt
138575 if we were to change our policy approach on uranium it would seriously undermine the nuclear non proliferation treaty we want that treaty to be enhanced
138576 well take a positive and constructive approach and we will certainly have non proliferation considerations uppermost in mind
138577 but we will also take into account the strategic importance of the arrangement to both india and the united states

138581 the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
138582 in order to provoke an attack which could then be used to justify material breach
138583 the most extraordinary exchange takes place when lt gen michael delong bemoans shrinking political support for neo con war plans on capitol hill and suggests that sympathy for the bush administrations agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack
138584 rumsfeld agrees that the psychological impact of 9 11 is wearing off and the behavior pattern of citizens in both the u s and europe suggests that they are unconcerned about the threat of terror

138601 wir haben beweise f r dieses wassereis schon auf beobachtungsdaten von mars odyssey gesehen und phoenix hat im letzten monat beobachtet wie kleine brocken auf der oberfl che langsam verschwunden sind aber hier wurde marswasser zum ersten mal ber hrt und geschmeckt
138602 die sonde ist in guter verfassung und auch die vorhersage f r die energie aus den solarzellen sieht vielversprechend aus deswegen wollen wir alle m glichkeiten aussch pfen diesen interessanten platz auf dem mars weiter zu untersuchen
138603 aber das freut uns denn nur durch solche berraschungen kann man auch entdeckungen machen eine berraschung war das verhalten des marsbodens

138612 green white is sinking like the titanic in the ocean
138613 that wasnt right it was a bad deal it will forever be in the mind of urban meyer and in the mind of our football team well handle it and its going to be a big deal
138614 i dont think theres any doubt last years game intensified the rivalry
138615 but what intensified the rivalry is that we won ok i mean thats the reality
138616 the one thing that worries me about him is hes too nice
138617 because he is very nice i wondered if hed be tough enough to be the head coach when everyones jumping down your throat we have found out he has an inner toughness that makes him able to handle it
138618 ive seen as much expectations with a player like herschel walker during his freshman year but not with a team
138619 people started talking national championship after the sugar bowl last year
138620 thats too long to be chewing on that bone so to speak i told the players that this preseason hype could be a blessing or a curse its a curse if you think it gives you a sense of entitlement to where you think you dont have to prepare it could be a blessing if you look at it as one of the greatest opportunities of your life
138621 after watching a good movie everyone is waiting for the second one to come out
138622 when i looked for what was the problem i looked in the mirror the players were pretty much doing what i was doing sitting waiting for something to happen so i thought maybe i needed to change
138623 even if we got to fake it were going to have more energy
138624 after the first score against florida i want you guys to celebrate so hard that the referees throw the flag
138625 i wont do anything like that again it could have easily turned into a big stupid brawl

138628 she can pour two cups know that its a first down and 9 and where the ball is and pass out cups at the same time

138630 it helped us realize how privileged we are and sometimes dont appreciate the blessings we do have
138631 it seems like it goes in cycles and in bunches and i think its historically gone from one school to the other as being the school with the most problems as nice as he is they know they cant get away with everything hes made some tough discipline decisions and that speaks volumes
138632 i told him if he changed his mind make sure you call me first thing in the morning he didnt call me at 6 or 7 oclock in the morning he called me at 2 or 3 in the morning and he said yes
138633 he has the best chance of anybody in this day and time of staying at one place because of his production and type of person he is but you need both

138654 if youre struggling with poverty and all that we have programs you can work on you come in and say im on welfare im doing this and that we can put you on a program
138655 i would think that three tickets now seems to be working all right and with the economic conditions that our constituents are facing i dont think adding this additional burden to their already beleaguered economic existence is a good idea
138656 it is going too far in terms of our approach of collecting revenue from scofflaws because there are a lot of people with two tickets who are willing to pay their tickets who feel they didnt have adequate notice
138657 would have to be convinced to vote in favor of something like that its not hard to get two tickets
138658 its a difficult choice but when the mayor points out its 48 million and we have looming ahead of us potentially a 400 million to 500 million deficit in our budget its something i think we should go after
138659 i made a mental note two years ago that i would not be here
138660 i have nothing against rock just right outside of your window
138661 people expect this kind of thing to be going on around here and its kind of fun

138683 i was in the uncollapsed part of the building with five of my friends immediately after the explosion and we felt flames rising from the downstairs to upper floors
138684 before the explosion i heard one of our teachers saying that a gas hose was not attached to its proper place in the kitchen
138685 we think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building given the burns on the injured
138686 it wasnt a matter of leveling outrage but of voicing israels strong concerns
138687 he mofaz urged the americans to set firm conditions such as a refusal to allow the iranians to enrich uranium on their turf and to be clear that the deadline must be preserved the iranians are simply looking for cracks to exploit
138688 the united states and israel share deep concern about irans nuclear program and the two delegations discussed steps to strengthen diplomatic efforts and financial measures to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability
138689 we also reaffirmed our strong mutual determination to counter irans support for terrorism

138694 er zijn wel eerder onderzoeken gedaan naar mobiel internet maar deze zijn nooit op de mobiele telefoon zelf uitgevoerd
138695 reclame op de mobiel is innovatief daarnaast heeft het een hoge attentiewaarde en daarmee een hoge herkenning dat ook de waardering hoog is mits de boodschap relevant maakt het mobiele internet nog interessanter voor adverteerders

138702 petugas mencatat kejadian tersebut terjadi kira kira pada 10 20 pm selasa sore pria yang menjadi tersangka sedang berbicara dengan polisi dia tidak ditahan dan tidak diminta datang ke kantor polisi penyelidikan masih berlanjut
138703 keputusan ini membuat kecewa para bobotoh lebih baik polda jabar audiensi dengan bobotoh ataupun dengan panitia pelaksana dulu
138704 kita tidak menjamin karena banyak bobotoh yang melakukan tindakan anarkis namun kita berharap polda jabar akan tetap mengizinkan jika kita beraudiensi tapi kalau tidak diizinkan juga kami akan mendukung polda ini untuk keamanan warga jabar juga

138710 im happy with the way my players responded to training yesterday after arriving back from tunisia on tuesday they were very tired but i am sure they will not disappoint me on saturday

138716 what happens with all of these vendors on the next generation the timing of all this is going to be interesting we know a little bit more now than we did a year ago but not a huge amount
138717 i know internally how many steps away the 3d hardware vendors are from where they think theyll be pitching consoles
138718 i think its going to be far too tempting to one up your competitor because they dont think youre doing this but you really are to get it out earlier and try and get some first mover advantage so i dont think its going to be too long
138719 i hope its long enough that were able to have a new project come out at a nice sweet spot for this generation and not when everybody knows whats coming next christmas

138724 de leiding van ons reisbureau heeft onlangs contact gehad met de dunya oogkliniek en heeft er een contract kunnen sluiten om vanuit heusden reizen te organiseren naar turkije
138725 de oogchirurg die de operatie in turkije uitvoert komt om de zoveel weken naar amsterdam om te beoordelen of een ingreep wel is aangewezen
138726 als dat niet het geval is wordt de operatie niet uitgevoerd zon vooronderzoek kost 150 euro
138727 het goedkoopste arrangement bij ons kost 750 euro en bestaat uit een vooronderzoek in het ziekenhuis in istanboel de oogoperatie zelf controles na de operatie in het ziekenhuis medicijnen voor de nazorg en drie controles na de operatie in de kliniek in amsterdam
138728 wie de oogoperatie wil combineren met drie overnachtingen in een turks hotel inclusief een citytrip naar istanboel betaalt 1 779 euro
138729 this is an incident in march it is going back a long while
138730 seeing a therapist and had been going through some difficulties
138731 i ran across to neighbors house looked in to see if anyone was in there
138732 well not everyone would do that so im glad he went into the house filled with smoke and tried to help me its something you dont have words for
138733 he went the extra distance to help his neighbor and investigated when he smelled smoke had he not done that a tragedy could have occurred

138770 it gives a direct connection between the viewers and alice

138774 with the internet its either an amazing site that can help save your life or its a terrible influence

138789 theyre city property and if we have to fire or replace that person that vehicle is now undriveable i think its a slap in the face to the residents of the city of wasilla if people are smoking in city vehicles use it and give it back the way you got it

138829 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
138830 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
138831 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
138832 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public

138954 this was the fifth feeling video id worked on however it was the hardest
138955 everything else before had been so meticulously planned that in the final grade rather than having to save shots we were just finessing
138956 the video was shot using the red camera owen oppenheimer cut the video on set loading files onto his computer with each change in scene
138957 after wrapping at 10 00pm owen and caswell carried on cutting before coming into rushes at 4 30am

138974 the one thing that worries me about him is hes too nice
138975 because he is very nice i wondered if hed be tough enough to be the head coach when everyones jumping down your throat we have found out he has an inner toughness that makes him able to handle it
138976 ive seen as much expectations with a player like herschel walker during his freshman year but not with a team
138977 people started talking national championship after the sugar bowl last year
138978 thats too long to be chewing on that bone so to speak i told the players that this preseason hype could be a blessing or a curse its a curse if you think it gives you a sense of entitlement to where you think you dont have to prepare it could be a blessing if you look at it as one of the greatest opportunities of your life
138979 after watching a good movie everyone is waiting for the second one to come out
138980 when i looked for what was the problem i looked in the mirror the players were pretty much doing what i was doing sitting waiting for something to happen so i thought maybe i needed to change
138981 even if we got to fake it were going to have more energy
138982 after the first score against florida i want you guys to celebrate so hard that the referees throw the flag
138983 i wont do anything like that again it could have easily turned into a big stupid brawl

138988 it helped us realize how privileged we are and sometimes dont appreciate the blessings we do have
138989 it seems like it goes in cycles and in bunches and i think its historically gone from one school to the other as being the school with the most problems as nice as he is they know they cant get away with everything hes made some tough discipline decisions and that speaks volumes
138990 i told him if he changed his mind make sure you call me first thing in the morning he didnt call me at 6 or 7 oclock in the morning he called me at 2 or 3 in the morning and he said yes
138991 he has the best chance of anybody in this day and time of staying at one place because of his production and type of person he is but you need both

139030 with the benefit of hindsight i realise that when i embarked upon the search for my first property investment it was more with optimism than in depth knowledge of the territory
139031 i imagined it would be relatively simple in essence conduct research find a desirable property in a reasonable area wait for the market to rise and then cash in on my good business acumen but of course it wasnt quite as straight forward as that at the beginning i experienced a pretty steep learning curve however several years later i am in the privileged position of providing property opportunities to other investors and i believe have made the whole process easier and the potential investment return for clients greater
139032 having successfully invested in our property opportunities in the uk members of our property investment club were keen to source similar prospects overseas a number of them required dual purpose property both for their own use and with the additional benefit of a rental return whilst others saw the exercise as a simple investment short term with a view to selling on completion or longer term to accrue further growth

139067 but this is my first year actually riding in it its just one more way to give back
139068 but there are so many people i know who are affected by cancer and its worth it knowing that you helped even one person ill keep riding until we find a cure for this dreaded disease that affects every family
139069 its a cause we can get behind for a variety of reasons
139070 there is so much support from volunteers and sponsors its incredibly well run and an efficient fund raiser
139071 you feel it every minute you ride the magnitude of the event on so many levels is amazing
139072 were going over to play a bunch of good teams like the boca juniors
139073 its a big training opportunity and bonding opportunity as well
139074 im real excited to play those teams its such a great opportunity our coach just wanted to try something new to create a better bond with the team and get in some great training while doing it
139075 its awesome just to go there but to play soccer its 100 times better argentina is known for putting together some great club teams and im looking forward to it as well as the other members of the team it is a once in a lifetime offer
139076 were looking forward to the upcoming season and are expecting a huge year
139077 this year is basically the same as the team last year we lost some good players but also gained some we lost two starting seniors
139078 we proved to ourselves last year that we can compete with anyone in our conference this gave us so much motivation to work and train harder in the summer to prepare for next year
139079 jake will continue to take on more of a leadership role this season
139080 as a freshman we used him as a forward last season as a sophomore we utilized his athleticism and converted him into a defensive central midfielder
139081 while he took some time to adjust and learn the position by the end of the season in my opinion he had become one of the best in his position in all of new england
139082 he has great size and strength which give him the versatility to play just about anywhere for us
139083 this season he will likely play in the midfield again for us and i expect him to be one of the most dominant players on the field in each game we play
139084 we will play four matches while in argentina against reserve and youth teams of argentine professional clubs
139085 the biggest name reserve team we will play is river plate which is consistently one of the top teams in all of south america
139086 but this is my first year actually riding in it its just one more way to give back
139087 but there are so many people i know who are affected by cancer and its worth it knowing that you helped even one person ill keep riding until we find a cure for this dreaded disease that affects every family

139090 you feel it every minute you ride the magnitude of the event on so many levels is amazing
139091 if you dont have much pitching the games become marathons we have plenty of arms i think we have a deeper staff than most teams from what ive seen
139092 if you have four good starters and at least a couple of good relievers youre in pretty good shape you have to have relievers you have confidence in who can throw strikes the seventh eighth and ninth innings tend to be where games are won
139093 the seedings dont mean much especially in the first games
139094 last year we had 140 runners combined in both races
139095 right now wednesday we have about 50 pre registered were hoping for a good turnout and last minute registrations
139096 we have a regular following so were excited about this years event
139097 thats her demeanor shes an a type athlete no aa athlete shes competitive
139098 i have to say i like hockey but running is part of my blood
139099 he is a big strong kid and i think hes confident
139100 thats a terrific time for a 10 year old to run
139101 i hope he appreciates the experience it couldnt happen to a nicer family we wish him the best of luck and hope itll becomes a part of his life hell remember forever
139102 if you dont have much pitching the games become marathons we have plenty of arms i think we have a deeper staff than most teams from what ive seen
139103 if you have four good starters and at least a couple of good relievers youre in pretty good shape you have to have relievers you have confidence in who can throw strikes the seventh eighth and ninth innings tend to be where games are won
139104 the seedings dont mean much especially in the first games
139105 he breaks on the ball well and is a great leader
139106 ive never been a kid to give up on anything
139107 kids laughed at me but i know what i want to do in life
139108 thats her demeanor shes an a type athlete no aa athlete shes competitive
139109 i have to say i like hockey but running is part of my blood
139110 he is a big strong kid and i think hes confident
139111 thats a terrific time for a 10 year old to run
139112 i hope he appreciates the experience it couldnt happen to a nicer family we wish him the best of luck and hope itll becomes a part of his life hell remember forever
139113 its good you should read it go and buy it
139114 the hard part for me was this derailed into a train wreck so quick so fast and so oddly
139115 you had the buddha zen master guy in spring training reading and life is good dont worry be happy and it just looked like he was poised to have a monster season physically he worked his butt off
139116 at the end of the day youre taking the field with a guy who doesnt want to play with you doesnt want to be there doesnt want to obviously effort wise is just not there and thats disheartening and disappointing
139117 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
139118 the red sox did the same with guys like nomar garciaparra and pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here
139119 tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
139120 but this is my first year actually riding in it its just one more way to give back
139121 but there are so many people i know who are affected by cancer and its worth it knowing that you helped even one person ill keep riding until we find a cure for this dreaded disease that affects every family
139122 its a cause we can get behind for a variety of reasons
139123 there is so much support from volunteers and sponsors its incredibly well run and an efficient fund raiser
139124 you feel it every minute you ride the magnitude of the event on so many levels is amazing
139125 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
139126 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
139127 they have that chemistry right now the dynamics is pretty interesting
139128 if you dont have much pitching the games become marathons we have plenty of arms i think we have a deeper staff than most teams from what ive seen
139129 if you have four good starters and at least a couple of good relievers youre in pretty good shape you have to have relievers you have confidence in who can throw strikes the seventh eighth and ninth innings tend to be where games are won
139130 the seedings dont mean much especially in the first games
139131 as soon as i started high school football i always wanted to play in the shrine game
139132 i think ive had a conversation with everyone on the team we all pretty much checked our egos and our rivalries at the door were all team new hampshire
139133 when its time to work its time to work but when were not practicing its been a lot of fun
139134 it was tempting to line him up in front of londonderry running back alex theodhosi and just let him clear a path but hes a true lineman we have a ton of skill kids so we knew we had him in the right place
139135 they asked me where i wanted to play and i told them it didnt really matter
139136 if they feel i can help the team more from that position guard thats fine
139137 they gave us a speech we watched a video took a tour
139138 originally they werent going to let us visit with the patients i guess because of the new privacy laws but a group of eight asked if we could see the patients and we went with a shrine official im sure there were more who wanted to go who couldnt
139139 none of them the patients spoke english so there was a definite language barrier an interpreter introduced us but i dont think they really understood who we were

139160 it was pitch dark when we jumped out of the train we saw ambulances in a distance but they could not immediately reach us
139161 we do not encourage that the armed forces should be used as an extension of para military forces to deal with law and order problems
139162 we feel states are best equipped to deal with ordinary law and order problems and if they are not they always have the option of calling in the para military forces
139163 calling in of armed forces should be in extraordinary situations
139164 till now no proof of sabotage or use of explosive has come to our notice however the inquiry report will establish the cause of the fire
139165 they only saw thick smoke emerging out of the coach suddenly
139166 the toll could have been higher if passengers had not alighted from other compartments after the train was stopped
139167 is an infcirc 66 type safeguards agreement based on the agencys standard safeguards practices and procedures
139168 more efficient mechanism for ensuring that safeguards requirements can be met
139169 it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
139170 such an umbrella approach could also be used for the conclusion of other 66 type safeguards agreements
139171 the termination provisions contained in the agreement are the same for other 66 type agreements
139172 natually as with all safeguards agreements this agreement is subject to the general rules of international law therefore the agreement should be read as an integral whole the preamble provides for contextual background and safeguards are implemented in accordance with the terms of the agreement
139173 nonetheless we recognise the congress as a secular party as the biggest political party in the country its role has a relevance in determining the secular character of the state at this juncture it is this concern which led us to extend support to the congress led upa government

139179 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
139180 we work only to pay for the fuel we are not making money
139181 we ask for more but clients cannot give us more because they have no money
139182 we want the government to increase the fares so that we can feed ourselves
139183 although we might suggest that if you arent rocking with the normal guitar getting a more expensive one isnt going to solve the problem

139193 we rode to bring attention to the elections and vermont we certainly accomplished that
139194 we were greeted in town after town by thousands of good people who appreciated our effort and could commit to making their own by voting in november to represent vermonters and vermonts many great companies in this endeavor was humbling and very gratifying for each of us
139195 we meet in every town every year as an official state holiday to determine spending and to elect our officials the great american voter trek took this vermont spirit on the road and even more powerfully on the web well be blogging through to november a trek of time and space
139196 on behalf of the farmers who own cabot and all the vermont companies who contributed we thank the riders for the commitment enthusiasm and heart that made the great american voter trek such a success
139197 having the opportunity to meet such a diverse group of people from so many different backgrounds helped me realize how important democracy is and why america is truly the greatest country in the world
139198 over the course of this trip i have realized how unique of an opportunity this quest has been but most of all this experience has meant traveling and meeting truly amazing people
139199 to be able to encourage people to take part in a democratic process that is truly unique to our country has been a great experience and one that i will never forget
139200 from a bicycle time slows way down and roads seem to stretch endlessly before you
139201 small towns with streets lined with flags are more charming hills seem steeper and higher fields flatter and emptier the sun feels hotter and the rain more penetrating and the food of course tastes more delicious the america i discovered on this trek is special like vermont to have worked to bring attention to peoples right to vote along the way is more meaningful than anything i can describe
139202 this trip has been an unbelievable opportunity to see my country in a way that few people will ever get to experience
139203 i was only doing a job that any member of the team could have done
139204 we both like nothing more than going to grand prix so being there for the honeymoon is fabulous

139208 advertising on socnets and what is wrong with cartier on myspace
139209 we are pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter and first half of the year our second quarter results were significantly and positively affected by sales and gross margin contributions from our friction management and load securement product lines in particular our divisions in montreal canada and sheffield england had very strong friction management product demand this quarter while sales of load securement products at our shipping systems division for the second quarter rose by more than 70 due mostly to sales of the winchock tm uni level vehicle securement system
139210 our overall sales volume for the first half of this year has been affected mostly by lower sales of our track component product line and a softening demand for our non rail related ci logistics material handling equipment division located in leicester england due mostly to a united kingdom economic slowdown year to date sales of our track component product line are lower due to the slow first quarter start some market share loss due to competitive price pressure and lower demand in certain market segments however we are confident that the variety of strategies we have implemented across our product lines will enable us to make progress towards our short term and long term sales growth these strategies include research and development efforts for developing new products and improving existing products aggressive marketing campaigns in china australia and south america focusing efforts on controlling our manufacturing and administrative costs and an ever vigilant effort for adding synergistic acquisitions
139211 looking forward we continue to be optimistic we have recently secured multi year contracts that are expected to contribute to net sales in the near future overall rail freight traffic in north america continues to be strong worldwide infrastructure spending is continuing at high levels and rail passenger ridership is increasing we believe that these trends will continue into the near future which are contributing to our optimism
139212 our program encourages consumers to dispose of unwanted electronics in an environmentally responsible manner
139213 reflects lgs global sustainability initiative that also encompasses energy conservation reduction of hazardous substances and responsible product designs
139214 people are seeking services to help them recycle electronic waste responsibly and economically
139215 this program serves consumers needs by offering a convenient and cost effective waste management solution while demonstrating our shared commitment to providing outstanding customer service and leadership in environmental stewardship
139216 by recycling used unwanted obsolete or damaged electronic equipment useful materials such as glass metals and plastics may be recovered for reuse in other products
139217 reuse minimizes the amount of waste disposed while also reducing the amount of raw materials extracted as well as energy required to make new materials additionally material reuse reduces the production of greenhouse gases
139218 that means lg and waste management are doing their part to improve recycling and reduce the environmental impact of waste products
139219 the explosive growth of electronics products over the years coupled with the rapid replacement of tens of millions of analog tvs as consumers upgrade to flat panel hdtvs underscores the need for companies like lg to provide responsible end of life solutions
139220 hes the ideal spokesperson for our brand not only does he enjoy mowing his own lawn but the attributes he is known for as a quarterback long term durability and superior performance are the same ones homeowners closely associate with our products
139221 when im away from football i love spending time on my snapper
139222 i just cannot imagine someone else mowing my lawn its something i can look back on at the end of the day and be proud of
139223 and someday after i retire i imagine ill spend even more time on my mower
139224 our improving cost structure and strengthened balance sheet continue to reflect the companys enhanced operating discipline and the success of our business improvement plan
139225 despite the negative impact of reduced u s equipment sales in the quarter the companys lean cost structure drove a net profit
139226 adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization were 4 2 million a 20 increase versus last year and debt net of cash at june 28 2008 was 22 6 million a 31 improvement over last year at the same time our third quarter 2008 results will include the benefits of the previously announced sale of the land and building of our lasertel property in tucson arizona for 8 75 million
139227 while european revenue recovered in the second quarter u s equipment sales were disappointing as economic headwinds challenged our ability to offset the expected erosion in our traditional portfolio with increased sales of our growth portfolio products however the improved operating discipline and cost structure that we have successfully created will leverage the profitability of future sales growth as the economy improves
139228 we have demonstrated excellent progress in significantly improving profitability and gross margin as well as reducing net debt
139229 when we developed our operating margin targets we did not anticipate the low level of european sales in the first quarter of 2008 which resulted from our 2007 business reviews the severity of the weakened u s economic picture and increased legal expenses related to the defense of our intellectual property and regulatory matters at the end of the first half of 2008 our operating margin is 4 while we are still driving our team to achieve these targets we believe it is prudent at this time to modify our 2008 operating margin guidance to a range between our current margin of 4 and the lower end of our target range as we are not optimistic about an economic recovery in the second half of this year as we monitor the economic situation through the remainder of 2008 we will be in a better position to assess our 2009 financial goals
139230 while the economy is beyond our control we made excellent progress in areas within our control i am extremely proud of the presstek team for delivering a first half improvement in income from continuing operations of 6 4 million or 0 18 per share results like this are only achieved with focus extreme dedication and relentless hard work when the economy begins to improve we will be well positioned to leverage revenue growth into higher levels of profitability

139238 the second quarter saw considerable progress made on a number of fronts at kemess gold production easily exceeded the revised forecast due to the continued strong performance in both the mining and milling departments and generated almost 65 million in cash flow from operations with strong production forecast in the fourth quarter of this year and high metal prices we will continue to generate significant cash flow to fund our various growth initiatives at young davidson we recently issued two important press releases first we released the results of the preliminary assessment report which outlines a 12 year mine life with average annual production of 158 000 ounces of gold per year at a cash cost of 405 per ounce second we released very positive drill results from our 2008 drill program which we expect will significantly increase the resource base upon which the project feasibility study will be based at stawell our aggressive 7 million exploration program continued to follow up on the excellent initial drill results in the golden gift 6 zone and examined a number of other in mine and near mine targets at the same time a number of strategic capital investments are underway to improve the operation for the longer term at fosterville the conversion to owner mining went very smoothly with completion ahead of schedule at the end of may underground development at the mine is now ramping up nicely with the ultimate objective of increasing mining rates and gold production in the last quarter of 2008 in addition in order to speed up the evaluation and engineering of metallurgical improvements a pilot plant was constructed and commissioned on site in late may testing to date has demonstrated the potential to improve gold recovery by approximately 10 engineering of the necessary process plant modifications is presently underway with a planned implementation date in the first quarter of 2009
139239 here are my heart and soul please grind them into hamburger and enjoy
139240 will congress give exxonmobil and the toy industry christmas in july or will it guarantee americas littlest consumers a safe holiday season by finishing cpsc reform now
139241 it would be a tragic irony if a law passed to protect against toy hazards didnt require toy hazard testing
139242 it comes down to risks versus benefits the risk is to our childrens health while the benefits go to exxonmobil which profits from phthalates
139243 the phthalate dinp must be included in the ban its the one most widely used in toys
139244 congress should never put an arbitrary cap on safety testing
139245 states should be able to step in when the federal government doesnt do enough to protect the public from unsafe products
139246 the 22 increase suggests strongly that what the toy industry called
139247 and points to the urgent need for congress to finish action on the cpsc reform act
139248 this study shows tremendous promise for female collegiate soccer players especially those with a history of acl injuries
139249 enjoying sports is a great way to stay fit and to stay healthy we encourage coaches athletic trainers and athletes to consider adapting this program into their routine
139250 pep was developed specifically to prevent serious knee injuries and their consequences
139251 we recommend that teams use it as an alternative warm up before training sessions putting pep widely into practice we hope will continue to show reduced risk of acl injury among soccer players
139252 at a time when bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to many of our best antibiotics it is an extremely bad idea to risk undermining gentamicins effectiveness for treating human disease by using it to treat a disease in apples
139253 the threat of antibiotic resistance is growing and the number of effective antibiotics is dwindling
139254 our priority must be to save these effective antibiotics for whom they are needed most for humans not for agriculture

139256 it has become clear that americas civilian institutions of diplomacy and development have been chronically undermanned and under funded for far too long relative to what we spend on the military and more important relative to the responsibilities and challenges our nation has around the world
139257 defense secretary gates is advocating for a smart power approach to us foreign policy and we cannot have smart power unless we have smart development
139258 smart development means the us must prioritize long term poverty alleviation alongside defense and diplomacy concerns
139259 the next president and his administration have a chance to put smart development in practice to create a better foreign aid system a better international face for the us that will help lift millions from poverty and re establish us global standing
139260 shes been showing all the pregnancy behaviors shes been nesting shes been grooming her paws and her body shes been sleeping shes been slow and lethargic
139261 we know were coming to the end because were monitoring her hormone levels
139262 her behavior has been inconclusive and her ultrasounds have been inconclusive
139263 when something like this happens it has a ripple effect that affects us all in one way or another
139264 for most of us that work would come after a cub is born
139265 his vital organs are not functioning well and he has developed pneumonia

139267 it is a matter of life and death if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets that there is no death sentence here i wonder if his arm is long enough to reach here
139268 i hope he gets a life sentence there is no death penalty at tribunal but for sure he deserves it
139269 with the global battle for business more intense than ever countries and their economic development organisations need to pay close attention to the results of this survey
139270 whether accurate or misguided perceptions about a locations business climate often play a crucial role in site selection where companies invest money and create jobs
139271 on the whole our findings suggest that marriage is a better predictor of parenting quality with regard to social fathers than biological fathers
139272 our study is relevant to understanding the quality of parental care that children receive from resident fathers across a range of family configurations that are now commonly experienced by children
139273 the survey results reveal that a sexy stomach isnt governed by age which is good news for all those wanting to tone up or maintain a flat tummy
139274 at the end of the day there is an order that mr ainsworth infringed our copyright and the next stage of the case will be discussing remedies for that
139275 senator imoke has not been indicted by any committee and even the efcc has come out to say so
139276 why would the pdp do that he has not committed or broken any law of the country that would warrant arrest
139277 we are definitely going to appeal the ruling it cannot stand at the appeal we insist that our client cant be tried based on the charges before the court in the next few days we will appeal this ruling
139278 it is an encouraging response but there is a long way to go
139279 clearly the market has grown after the first week of sampling now the effort is to hold up the stake the important thing here is that our ratings are not driven by a single show but by three different programmes

139281 wayne was interviewed by police in connection with an alleged minor offence involving a paparazzi photographer who had been persistently invading his and coleens privacy throughout the evening
139282 this included the photographer following the couple into a restaurant from which he had to be evicted
139283 initially we planned to work from eight in the morning until four in the morning with a four hour break seven days a week
139284 but we will have generators and diggers running and it is noisy and there were concerns of noise for the people living nearby
139285 we have been instructed that working hours must be reduced from seven in the morning to eleven at night
139286 we have committed to do whatever is necessary to make sure we do still finish the work by august 23
139287 we are sorry for any inconvenience this is causing there is never a good time to close a major junction like this but we have been working closely with manchester city council to try and minimise disruption
139288 as you are aware there was wanton abuse of office by the immediate past administration thus this trend has to be checked for the sake of posterity in order to redress any wrong as a result of such abuse therefore this should serve as a reminder to us that as we are expected to be accountable in the performance of our duties here so we shall all be accountable to almighty allah in the hereafter
139289 the security men searched everywhere including the pots the refrigerator ceiling drainage wardrobe everywhere and everything
139290 they did not spare anything all this while they did not allow anybody to go out or come into the house including dokubos children
139291 i think the problem may be because of the presence of expatriates who i hired to teach in my proposed king amachree automobile academy in warri i hired six lebanese and one russian married to a nigerian to teach there
139292 no question about it this has been an extremely aggressive schedule
139293 theres something happening on this project 24 hours a day seven days a week
139294 people are really excited about whats rising from the ashes and theres a general feeling that this project has not only been done quickly its been done right
139295 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
139296 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
139297 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
139298 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
139299 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
139300 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
139301 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
139302 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible

139313 yes i think people are ready for this and should have no problem adapting just as they have in workplaces our concept is based on ideas we originated over the years in workplace design by looking at shared table type environments vs typical cubicles you can immediately understand the effect on communication spontaneity and curiosity and how that can translate to idea generation efficiency and community in work if studios has been successful in transforming how people can interact at work why cant we apply those same ideas to how people interact in social places such as a cafe
139314 there are the functional pieces such as cases for cold beverages and food then there are more versatile pieces such as peninsula tables that build off the main 60 long common table these create nodes for gathering or can be a place where someone might find more privacy rather than sitting on the common area the concept also allows for the pieces to branch off from the main table and create areas in the space for special settings such as a poetry reading or community gathering the table is simply a framework which elements and people work organically off of
139315 the decision was made as hwang still stands on trial on charges that he violated the nations bioethical laws and was fired from his school for paper fabrication and other unethical problems in obtaining eggs in relation to his research on stem cells in 2006
139316 there is no clause in the regulation on bioethics that states the proposed study must be disapproved when its chief researcher is on trial
139317 politicizing the olympics runs contrary tot the olympic spirit and the shared aspirations of people all over the world
139318 it is inevitable that people hold divergent views on issues but politicizing the olympics will not address those issues
139319 instead those issues can be resolved on the basis of mutual respect by narrowing the differences and expanding common ground
139320 the olympic games will leave us some sports venues and infrastructure facilities
139321 we very much treasure such a material legacy and certainly we will make the best use of these facilities and venues and fully bring into play their functions and roles
139322 but id like to say that we also recognize the spiritual legacy that will be left by beijing olympics games which certainly will last much longer and is more valuable
139323 by hosting the beijing olympic games we want to work vigorously to promote the protection of ecology and the environment and we will also work vigorously to make the sky clearer land greener and the water cleaner
139324 more importantly we want to enable the consciousness and awareness of the conservation culture to sink deep into the hearts of the people
139325 the reports about us concerns and mistrust of pakistans security institutions are serious in nature
139326 this is a special occasion whenever i used to work on a script at the back of my mind i always had that i should pack a message also children today are well equipped to express themselves

139329 we went to the pool at the maldives resort together he kept egging us to come into deeper water even though none of us knew swimming he even mocked his drowning once and laughed it off the second time which we realized later that he was actually drowning we didnt take it seriously we shouted for help but it was too late

139331 he promised that his first album would be of shabads because he took his role as an icon for the sikh youth seriously ishmeet to me was really special because his success had not gone to his head and at heart he remained the sweet simple boy from ludhiana with the love of sikhi swelling in his heart
139332 he saw himself as blazing a trail for his young sikh brothers and sisters who he hoped would follow their dreams achieving great successes while proudly displaying the khalsa form and spirit he felt that he had been given a great responsibility to inspire and to coax the best out of the sikh youth
139333 it is a tough time for banks and it is a clear indication or intention from rbi side to slowdown on the asset growth side the concerns there are squeezed firstly from their slowing down assets secondly on the non performing assets npas potential delinquencies which we have seen increasing and it is only likely to increase over a period of time with the squeeze getting much there very importantly the fee income which was the driving source of revenue for them will also come under pressure because we have seen that they are growing much faster though or they were growing much faster than the asset growth per se so contraction also would be in the similar fashion
139334 the rising interest rates putting pressure on the bonds so you are losing on the mark to market mtm side as well at this point of time the pressures are many but on the valuation side this is the sector where the valuation is one of the lowest and has reached a level which makes them attractive so may not be for the purely short term perspective but for a medium term perspective i think banking is a sector that will continue to remain favorite at this point in time
139335 i personally hold selan exploration technology in my portfolio and i have recommended this stock a number of times to my clients as well i am quite positive about this stock and i feel that in the next three months this stock is likely to test somewhere between rs 368 and rs 380 and with a one year perspective i have put a technical target of rs 550 the company has just posted stellar results in the form of nearly 400 rise in sales and 400 rise in profits and given a dividend re 1 50 paisa also this is the beginning of good fundamental performances going forward so i am pretty much bullish both fundamentally as well as technically
139336 we have valued the core business at rs 223 giving a p e of 10x to fy2010e eps hdo estimates remain unchanged hdos eps for fy09e and fy10e stands at rs 8 5 and rs 13 we value ivrcls 52 stake in the company at 25 discount rs 15 bot valuations have been scaled down to rs 37 from the earlier per share value of rs 44 factoring for higher interest and raw material cost we value ivrcls diluted 63 stake in ivr prime at 20 discount to npv estimates at a value of rs 34 per share unchanged at the cmp of rs 302 the stock trades at discount of 17 4x fy2009e eps of rs 17 4 and 13 6x fy2010e eps of rs 22 3 we maintain a hold on the stock with a sotp target price of rs 309
139337 one will see lot more fireworks in reliance my feeling is that once it crosses rs 2 315 2 325 kinds of levels then it can actually move up even further once above rs 173 174 range reliance petroleum will also do well among the metal stocks i like sterlite industries a lot

139405 gerade die kinder aus dieser verw hnten generation haben gro e probleme sich an das harte training zu gew hnen am anfang ist es besonders hart da verletzen sie sich auch schon mal und das tut nat rlich weh
139406 ich bin nicht wie ihre mutter ich bin f r die kinder hier eher so etwas wie ihre oma die trainer und auch die lehrer sind sehr streng aber ich nicht

139414 i studied for three months straight i didnt worry about rest because i knew what i was striving for
139415 i studied night and day went to study hall three times a week and attended a mock board every saturday
139416 it involved a lot of research and reading every army regulation i could get my hands on
139417 i still had to support the mission take care of my soldiers and fulfill my platoon sergeant duties
139418 i made sure there were no shortcomings in any of those areas
139419 it is an honor to know my efforts for the past 23 years havent gone unnoticed and one of my own subordinate leaders recognized it and my peers welcomed the honorary induction to the elite organization
139420 i am extremely proud and honored to be selected because someone saw i possessed the qualities needed to be in the audie murphy club
139421 i tend to uphold the charter of the club and continue to lead from the front
139422 it says a lot about the soldiers its a lot of hard work there isnt anything that is given to them you have to proficient in skills that require you to go in an area where danger exists as soon as you walk out of the gate and have the mental stamina to prepare for grueling boards
139423 i knew when i was a private i had an outstanding non commissioned officer who showed me the way
139424 its a privilege and an honor to be one of the newest members of the audie murphy club
139425 i worked hard to get where i am and im thankful for my soldiers who put up with me during the three months where i studied a lot and slept a little
139426 i put my time and energy into studying so i could be well prepared for the final selection board
139427 the one constant that always remains is the samc is an organization of ncos who are dedicated to leading training and taking care of soldiers
139428 the purpose of the sgt audie murphy award is to reward ncos whose leadership achievements and performance merit special recognition
139429 it is also a means of recognizing those ncos who have contributed significantly to the development of a professional nco corps and a combat ready army
139430 members of the club exemplify leadership characterized by personal concern for the needs training development and welfare of soldiers and concern for families of soldiers
139431 its a committee of great non commissioned officers that get together support the community and promote and increase the welfare and morale of the war fighter
139432 just being a part of the club is a great opportunity
139433 to be part of a prestigious club is why i strived to become a member and continuously push my ncos to become members
139434 to me it is a start point to work as a nco you get to a point where you are not a regular soldier you set the example and have to come to the right decision with only minimal guidance
139435 the most amazing thing about him is that for a man of his obvious tremendous skills he never had an amateur fight

139456 when we went out to retailers with the initial concept of selling this product at these prices their were eyebrows raised particularly as the psp market seems relatively stagnant

139468 we do not have a machine to say what this patient will do
139469 he had depression but we treated him and his symptoms were improving
139470 he said do not send me on leave i do not feel safe
139471 he was more anxious he had never been like that before
139472 he wanted to stay on the ward we thought that might not be appropriate we thought we could give him some more leave and he could see me on a daily basis
139473 people being agitated to the point of pleading on their knees thats an unusual level of agitation if you have ended up on a psychiatric ward you are a high risk
139474 dr gupta did not actually review the patient himself that would have been the prudent thing to do
139475 mr whetton was agitated he fell to his knees pleading with staff not to discharge him the team were collectively concerned to inform the psychiatrist but no formal examination was made the consultant psychiatrist did not see him as a result of that decision it was agreed he should be sent on home leave i find that this was a contributing factor in mr whettons death
139476 the first tee was frankly more difficult than i thought it would be
139477 but i made a good swing and the nerves went away absolutely five feet off the tee box and i didnt have them all day again

139479 someone drops the puck someone hits you in the face there are not any more nerves thats the game
139480 theres no place out here to just kind of shake them
139481 after i hit balls on the practice range i went for a jog i ran over to the clubhouse just to breathe a little harder and try to calm down a bit so i dont think theres a whole lot you can do on the golf course other than have the experience of going through it
139482 the difference with hockey is youre nervous youve got all that anxiety and youre ready to go but the first shift you get out there and you pop somebody or somebody pops you and then the games on the nerves are gone
139483 thats why were training today so were good to go when it happens
139484 if youre afraid of heights you need to remember that youre doing it for your community and your patient
139485 i get nervous if im waiting before i go on stage
139486 i try to be busy ill be putting on the finishing touches of my makeup or clothes

139510 any travellers caught up in the chaos at the opening of terminal 5 will recognise claims by the head of the international air transport association giovanni bisignani that heathrow is a national embarrassment
139511 london first has condemned the hassle factor of the delays and poor customer service at heathrow
139512 air passengers deserve a smooth and efficient journey from arrival to when they land at their destination
139513 queues at check in and security should be minimised and passenger comfort not retail takings should be put first and foremost while waiting for flights
139514 delays should not hold up planes for long periods of time on the runway nor should flights be left stacking over cities wasting time and creating significantly increased carbon emissions unfortunately this is not the case at present
139515 in between january and end of july we have contracted 38 hotels with 9 300 rooms more than in the full year 2007 53 properties with 8 937 rooms we are clearly setting new standards
139516 we are seeking opportunities especially in dynamic markets which are less affected by the uncertainties surrounding the global economy
139517 where the demand for mid and upmarket hotels is high and the presence of international brands low
139518 due to market conditions in emerging markets we like any of our competitors may experience delayed openings
139519 in order to compensate and to balance our risk we also growing in the nordics and the rest of western europe and we select experienced business partners with a solid background
139520 starting in scandinavia and coming via europe to emerging markets like the middle east and africa we always followed a solid strategy and never left it to chance
139521 we complete this by being asset light as one of the first hotel companies worldwide to have adopted this business model and also by managing only a few but clearly defined brands
139522 this is a very exciting time to be developing hotels in the ukrainian capital there is a strong demand which will only grow from both business and leisure travellers itt plaza brings enormous knowledge and experience to the relationship and ihg is delighted to be working with them on our first crowne plaza in kiev

139524 the volume and quality of data available are sufficient to publish provisional national results and that there is broad consistency of results with previous years
139525 ofqual recognises that the confidence of teachers parents pupils and the wider public has been damaged by the problems in delivering this years national curriculum tests
139526 however ofqual advised that as at 28 july there was no evidence of widespread problems with the quality of the marks at key stage 2 that would justify withholding publication of the provisional results at national level
139527 ofqual will be closely monitoring the review process to ensure that it is carried through accurately and objectively so that pupils get the marks their work deserves
139528 ets do still have a substantial number of scripts that remain to be marked and entered

139530 we expect that these outstanding scripts will significantly close the gap alongside resolution of outstanding data processing issues
139531 while the government offers bland reassurances that things will be alright on the night teachers heads and parents have lost faith in ministers handling of this years tests
139532 schools across the country have reported wildly erratic and inconsistent marking and there will be a significant number of appeals
139533 parents and pupils need certainty that this fiasco will not be repeated next year and the government isnt providing it

139737 im not going to tell you that weve never seen a political investigation here before
139738 but this one did have a good deal of political interest and outcry why this was a very highly visible event of incredible magnitude bridges dont fall in the united states its rare that they do very rare
139739 but we do not engage in politics we are not influenced by politics
139740 we are not protecting the governors butt any longer this has got to be done
139741 you can only fiddle with this stuff so long people dont like increases in taxes i dont but i dont know how else to pay for that
139742 the crime has signs of premeditation he called cara to his apartment put the music on high volume and killed her with knife blows he then took her body to the bathroom and then he went off to a party it was only the following day he dismembered the girls body
139743 he took various photos of the chopped up body with his cellphones camera including photos like those of the taliban
139744 i won because my rhino beetle worked so hard for me
139745 kids nowadays live in a digital world and they only play video games but rhino beetles are so analog they just wont go the kids way
139746 so im glad the kids got to experience that and really enjoy it
139747 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier
139748 were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
139749 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
139750 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
139751 hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
139752 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
139753 its a good deal for pittsburgh they got four good players
139754 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
139755 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
139756 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
139757 it attracts independent people who sometimes get a little isolated
139758 people find that theyre making a lot of money in season and are still not really happy
139759 recently people have been depressed about the economy even if it has nothing to do with their personal wealth
139760 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
139761 we do not encourage that the armed forces should be used as an extension of para military forces to deal with law and order problems
139762 we feel states are best equipped to deal with ordinary law and order problems and if they are not they always have the option of calling in the para military forces
139763 calling in of armed forces should be in extraordinary situations
139764 we are very clear that we will not allow middlemen in defence contracts and suppliers whether foreign or domestic will have to strictly adhere to the requirement of the armed forces
139765 the most important aspect of the dpp 2008 is that it will enable the ministry to be more transparent in procurement and at the same time it will be speedy and avoid delays
139766 service headquarters will now approve cases of up to rs 50 crore financial power delegated to defence secretary has been enhanced to rs 75 crore and only cases above 100 crore will be brought before the defence acquisition council
139767 we have already expressed our concern and the issue of ceasefire violation has been taken up with pakistan at the highest level
139768 we get setbacks in improving relations but we will keep on making attempts to harmonise the relationship with our neighbours
139769 a total of 19 incidents have occurred since january 2008 and a large number of incidents have occurred in the months of june and july these are unusual months when maximum attempts of infiltration are made by terrorists
139770 in no event shall any employee in group a be paid less than that which was paid to the employee in the prior year budget
139771 indestructible as the memories we have of them those killed
139772 a lot of families ideas were included in the design its very different the stelae remind me that prior to july 7 these 52 people that died stood tall in this world the material itself is as indestructible as the memories we have of them we wanted a proper memorial so we have taken our time
139773 using the language of architecture to make order out of chaos this monument is an opportunity for loss victims to be in contact with the living through a process of discovery where the memorials structure becomes complete through the presence and body language of the curious visitor
139774 nm lo ga ad slh ngsh no ke gw kl lo
139775 no question about it this has been an extremely aggressive schedule
139776 theres something happening on this project 24 hours a day seven days a week
139777 people are really excited about whats rising from the ashes and theres a general feeling that this project has not only been done quickly its been done right
139778 the bridge collapse remains to me a symbol of a state and nation that hasnt paid sufficient attention to its infrastructure
139779 the new bridge shows what we can do when we focus our attention and resources now lets move on to the rest of the system
139780 sure they are in that hes got impact on the checks on the bridge of his nose over his shoulder over the backs of his hands and knuckles and even down around his knees and his chins
139781 gentle little people about 3 to 4 feet tall wearing halloween masks
139782 theyre just moving theyve been quiet theyve been going upstairs in the bedrooms and hiding behind the artifacts but they dont talk
139783 maam i dont have the time to tell you youll see it for yourself please send somebody over here
139784 im due to go to london and take a look over everything but no deal has been done yet with arsenal
139785 it is difficult for us to take a decision but arsenal is certainly something that gokhan needs to look at
139786 he didnt have any more money to spend on legal fees he was much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned
139787 ill tell you we made great progress in the investigation
139788 i was questioned by the feds and i sung like a canary
139789 inquiries are at an early stage and these will continue to establish the circumstances of this tragic incident
139790 obviously my thoughts go out to the friends and family of those who have died
139791 the whole industry has been doing really quite well but it has grown so fast over the last couple of years that returns are starting to drop pretty sharply
139792 all of a sudden therell just be too many blueberries one year and they wont be worth anything
139793 weve had the best of both worlds increasing supply and increasing pricing really driven by the whole health interest in blueberries
139794 we have to continue to keep supply and demand in balance for the blueberry growers
139795 a lot of people who traditionally buy from growers theyre not committing and its creating a lot of uncertainty in the market
139796 this industry was due for a tremendous growing pain and i think this year is the first year of the effects of that its due to the success of the crop farmers do jump on each others bandwagons when theres a successful crop
139797 how long it will last will depend on whether the average consumer can continue to afford our crop
139798 mysl m e veci napreduj zna ne r chlej ie ako ke sme za nali
139799 hes a great employee whod never do something like that
139800 de zelfstandigenaftrek is een aftrekpost bij de berekening van uw winst op uw aangifte inkomstenbelasting u neemt de zelfstandigenaftrek dus mee bij de berekening van de winst uit uw onderneming
139801 een eventueel verlies kan binnen het belastingjaar worden gecompenseerd met positieve andere box i inkomsten horizontale verliescompensatie een eventueel resterend verlies kan worden teruggewenteld carry back naar positieve belastbare box i inkomens over de afgelopen drie jaar en onbeperkt met toekomstige positieve box i inkomsten carry forward
139802 de milieu investeringsaftrek is een aftrek op de belastbare winst hetgeen leidt tot een lagere fiscale winst of een hoger fiscaal verlies
139803 this is an unfortunate event and not something we are very pleased about we sincerely hope to bring to our fans brighter news in the days to come
139804 i wish we had those people on the field because we certainly would have an opportunity to be a little bit further along than we are
139805 we are looking forward to getting them all back steve smith was back out there today not really totally over the issue with his groin but he was back out there that was good in that position when you practice the way you should be you really need to distribute the load thats why you need the numbers and when the numbers are down you have fewer people doing the multitude of the work and it can become an issue of overload were just trying to make sure that the guys that we have stay on the field
139806 there were some situation defenses we played that we had him come out for he is going to continue to get that kind of work were moving around some of our nickel and dime stuff putting different people in different spots were just trying to give everybody a lot of work
139807 freds had a good camp hes in outstanding condition hes worked hard and its very obvious he is very quick off the mark and hes penetrated and been in the backfield about four times on us in the last two days the down block is supposed to take care of that but we cant seem to do it you talk about a big strong man but also a guy thats really done a nice job in terms of conditioning himself and its really paying off on the field were hoping that it continues because there is no doubt he has it in him a couple of years ago when he was our defensive mvp thats about where he was in terms of his conditioning
139808 from foreigners point of view it might seem like a slowdown in reform but fukuda sees it as steady reform
139809 i see this as a cabinet reshuffle to show that fukuda wants to call a general election under his leadership
139810 i think an election is highly likely around the end of year to the beginning of next year but its possible that itll be earlier than that thats what we will be calling for
139811 it sends a signal that the ldp is not coming up with fresh new ideas that i think is going to be a losing strategy i mean he is a throw back to old style politics
139812 ok he can talk about how many manga he reads but he is from the old school
139813 there are many in the ruling bloc who have a sense of crisis that they cannot win an election under fukuda
139814 were working at full capacity to put out what has become antalyas biggest and most damaging fire in history
139815 right now a large piece of land is under heavy smoke we think about 4 000 hectares have been affected
139816 if its not saturday but next week well not make a big fuss about it what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the very coming days
139817 we are continuing our double approach of dialogue and pressure if dialogue does not work we could continue with additional pressure at the u n or eu level
139818 if thaksin doesnt want to be jailed he will have to seek asylum
139819 the ruling against his wife could have been the other way around if he genuinely quit politics as he always claims he may have won election battles but he will not win these legal battles under the present unusual circumstances
139820 there is nothing suspicious about his overseas trip he wont run away but will certainly report himself at the court on aug 11
139821 suddenly picks up the ballpen and tested if it still writes on his hand
139822 sleep is important for higher cognitive functions like abstract reasoning
139823 and it also probably plays an important role in memory which are important components of learning and doing well in school
139824 you cant go from going to bed late and getting up late every night and every morning during summer to all of a sudden making a transition of three hours earlier in your bedtime and your rise time
139825 one mistake parents make is they put the children to bed and then continue on with loud tv or music thats distracting
139826 we see children routinely ingesting iced tea and soft drinks in the evening and that caffeine especially to a child who is sensitive can keep a child from getting adequate sleep
139827 if they see their parents eating breakfast theyre going to eat breakfast as well
139828 its not only what is served at the meal but who is at the meal
139829 when you look at academic performance many factors are going to contribute to brain function
139830 parents dont often think about muscle tension positive mental imaging reflex memory problem solving creative thinking things that really do add to the academics
139831 it doesnt have to be a program designed like adults just physical activity
139832 what if i want to offer a draw but not want my opponent to find out about that
139833 powys teaching local health board is working with the local gp practice in llanidloes with a view to transferring the service to the practice
139834 discussions are ongoing with the practice on when that might take place
139835 we are satisfied that google is putting in place adequate safeguards to avoid any risk to the privacy or safety of individuals including the blurring of vehicle registration marks and the faces of anyone included in street view images although it is possible that in certain limited circumstances an image may allow identification of an individual it is clear that google are keen to capture images of streets and not individuals
139836 theyve lost a friend theyve lost a teammate theyve lost a brother and thats not easy
139837 i think for the most part they understand the direction were going in some probably even support the direction were going in but its tough
139838 you take a player who has performed the way jason bay has performed off the team and you bring in three young players while 1 2 3 4 5 years from now it should be self explanatory right now its a shock
139839 its tough for these guys and tough to adjust to
139840 if thats the case ill look forward to that atmosphere
139841 it will certainly be a list that no college or university president will want to be on
139842 however if they are on it my guess is they will have very good explanations for why for example big budget cuts for state appropriations
139843 recognizes the remarkable power of sunshine and transparency to empower consumers
139844 anything that we can get any new information at all whether it is from the lab or tips that help us find caylee that much quicker
139845 i think with all agencies working forward and going as a team we will bring her home a lot faster
139846 um well when i get a chance to actually write a little bit more i should be able to do that within the next little bit because i have i guess quote rec time
139847 our whole family spent the entire day yesterday sharing things with the authorities so again we cannot impede their investigation
139848 i cannot give you names of people potentially linked to this thing
139849 i actually received a phone call today now from a number that is no longer in service
139850 this is what its all about okay this is what its all about
139851 shes leading you to a place but shes not telling you to the exact right apartment because shes afraid if someone walks in something may happen to caylee thats all i can say without jeopardizing this case
139852 if theres ever anything particularly that i should look into or attempt to follow up on
139853 yea ill definitely let you know as things come up if anything does at all
139854 we didnt ask her for any information except how shes feeling and what she wanted me to tell caylee she continues to say she loves her with all her heart and shes okay
139855 this organization started off as an army initiative covenant about how to best improve our relationship with our communities
139856 we realized that we already had that support all you have to is show up at one of our departure or arrival ceremonies to realize that our communities support and love our troops
139857 i saw how the streets were lined with people and yellow ribbons all the way to mid plains community college where the ceremony was the show of support to those soldiers brought tears to your eyes thats why it is fitting to hold the first community partnership here in north platte
139858 there is only one nebraska national guard member who has received the medal of honor
139859 and that was buffalo bill cody who was member of the nebraska militia at the time its just another thing about north platte that we appreciate
139860 i believe support starts with family it was a family member of a deployed soldier who started the canteen it was a family member of a deployed soldier who started the program here to send care packages to our soldiers family members provided a lot of support to us which in turn carried over to the rest of the community
139861 the 1074th would like to extend our sincere thanks to the community and to north platte thank you north platte
139862 on behalf of my administration the city council and the city of north platte we thank the 1074th for everything they do in our community for the state and for the united state of america
139863 we are very proud of each and every one of you
139864 i also want to thank the families of the soldiers
139865 it was amazing to see the amount of love and support the 1074th is north plattes home and we are very proud of that and we are very honored that north platte is the first sight of the community partnership celebration
139866 the strength of soldiers come from the strength of their families
139867 the strength of families is supported by the strength of the community the strength of the community comes from the support of employers educators civic and business leaders and its neighbors
139868 my understanding is that the horse had been examined and was being fed under his recommendations so was he under keetens care yes and no
139869 i dont want to put words into the veterinarians mouth but we were told that the horse had some intestinal problems and a couple of lesions
139870 all of that was age related the horse was 22 years old you cant make a horse young again
139871 even his own feces to survive if there is anything at all available to the horse he will eat it to survive
139872 the way you described the horses water supply does leave open the possibility that the horse could have picked up a disease from its water or even from its feed
139873 alleen de officiele persvertegenwoordiger praat van nu af aan met de pers
139874 vandaag was ik mijn handtas nog kwijt ik had hem perongeluk aan het stuur van een andere fiets gehangen dat heb ik weer
139875 hoe het kaatsspelletje in elkaar steekt weet ik nog niet maar ik ben benieuwd om mee te maken waarom franeker helemaal op zn kop staat op deze bijzondere dag
139876 we zijn al eerder in franeker geweest hoor maar hebben nog nooit aan de elfstedentocht voor motorboten deelgenomen we hebben wel aan andere lange tochten deelgenomen in de buurt van de grote rivieren in het midden van het land
139877 ja die hebben een haringparty hier ergens op een terrein in de buurt
139878 if they hire a legal work force to begin with none of this would be there
139879 if all workers were not covered under workers compensations laws
139880 the government doesnt pay for it employers pay for it
139881 the premiums are part of the employers cost of doing business
139882 if his capacity to work has been diminished that disability will continue whether his future employment is in this country or his homeland
139883 would do more to improve uk market conditions than any other domestic or international initiative
139884 companies involved in the market have arranged their affairs so that they can sustain high and rising profits whatever the level of their final prices to households and small businesses companies can therefore be observed to make more money with fewer customers hardly a punishment for driving their customers to switch
139885 the mps report was correct when it stated that higher gas and electricity bills would have serious consequences for millions of households however it did not look at the bigger picture in terms of providing real solutions for the benefit of the consumer
139886 with households already feeling the pinch and with energy bills at a record high there is a real sense of urgency for the government to step in and take action
139887 we would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to all the people who have been involved with the investigation into our son davids death
139888 to the police for the long hours immense amount of additional work and investigation required hampered by the fact that no remains or body have ever been recovered
139889 for the forensic and scientific officers who we believe without their individual hard work expertise and testimony there could possibly never have been the evidence to hold a trial
139890 the understanding way that all who have been involved with keeping us informed of developments with what at times have been both sensitive and distressing information to us
139891 to family friends and colleagues for all their support and understanding for their assistance and patience throughout the whole traumatic period
139892 to all davids friends colleagues and associates for their support and sympathy for their understanding and help for the assistance they have given to the police and others especially during the earlier stages of the investigation
139893 to the jury for their attention diligence and commitment throughout this long and distressing trial
139894 we feel both the verdict and sentence passed are both right and fair we can now try to start moving forward and rebuild our lives
139895 our lives will never be the same again we will always live with the knowledge that we have never had the opportunity to draw any permanent line or put a stop to this
139896 we have not had the opportunity and probably never will to lay david to rest in the normal sense of the word we pray that wherever he is that he is at rest
139897 its a way to drink alcohol without having to deal with the harsh taste of alcohol
139898 this is a complex issue and we believe that scapegoating a particular product is wrong
139899 i would like to price my kids out of the alcopop arena
139900 if you semiretire at age 62 and if youre taking social security benefits that is money you dont have to pull from retirement assets
139901 you will want to choose a retirement age based on your circumstances so you will have sufficient income when you need it
139902 if you are really strapped for money this is not a good idea
139903 provide a medium for stakeholders to express their views on issues of common interest for the purpose of achieving mutual resolutions cordial co existence and amiable environment for operators in oil industry communities and security agencies
139904 ma che sono queste stronzate che me ne faccio di questa puttanata pensi che sia una di quelle donne annoiate e sole io caromio voglio fare dei progetti nella mia vita capito pro get ti e copriti che tira vento e anche tu a proposito lo vuoi capire che uno stile di vita sedentario non va bene dovresti fare un po di moto e se non proprio smettere almeno diminuire col fumo magari potremmo iscriverci insieme ad un corso di pilates che ne dici
139905 the evidence did not persuade us that wearing the pink patch would result in a loss of body fat
139906 very hot as well very similar to what we see in omaha
139907 it only takes about 20 minutes to register when you call or fill out the application online
139908 its the best way to find out if you are eligible for a grant or low interest disaster loan a lot of people may qualify even if they have some insurance coverage
139909 at this stage of the recovery process the emphasis for assistance is to meet the long term needs of victims
139910 sba customer service representatives are available at disaster loan outreach centers and at the recovery centers to issue loan applications answer questions about sbas disaster loan program explain the application process help each individual complete their application and close their approved disaster loans
139911 the success we have depends on the amount of people that come to the events
139912 the fair is certainly a good opportunity for us to find good and forever homes for our animals and im really hoping that we have a successful day
139913 its really important that people understand the need for animal education and to find these animals a good home
139914 we are excited about the opportunity that saturday could provide
139915 to be standing here and looking out on the only facility like this on the planet
139916 myself our staff weve been well received and people are excited right now
139917 ultimately its our job to keep them excited by putting a good product on the field and thats what were focused on right now
139918 when i decided to hire bo i thought one thing that was important was that we have somebody that had some understanding of the culture of nebraska
139919 maybe what had worked in the past and what would work in the future
139920 i think bo has seized upon that some coaches try to fight tradition and they want to establish their own path its important to recognize what went on before and build on that
139921 i do sense that the stadium at one time was somewhat divided
139922 i think now that we have a little bit more unity of purpose in a state like nebraska where you only have 1 8 million people its really important that everybody is on the same page
139923 you have to be able to recruit were not close to major population centers
139924 two areas that we are trying really hard right now to improve are the academic center which really has not had anything major done to it since it was built in 1984
139925 the other thing is that we feel that weve got a lot of memorabilia a lot of stuff that is in storage that wed like to have displayed somewhere
139926 were excited about the prospects of what we can accomplish but theres a lot of hard work ahead of us and theres a job to do and were just going to take it day by day
139927 its been a great experience so far and i think weve accomplished a lot in a short amount of time and now its time to go to the field and get this thing headed in the right direction
139928 it reminded all of us still walking that night how a cancer survivor goes through many storms before coming to the end of treatments
139929 it was especially moving for all of us to continue through the night and complete the relay one of our biggest success stories this year is that we gathered 160 inches of hair for locks of love
139930 i was locked away in my house for more than six years
139931 at that point in my life if you paid me a quarter i would have shot myself
139932 we were talking one day and i said i bet there are a lot of people in the same situation as i am
139933 people who want to get out to hunt and fish but cant
139934 i took the idea to them in february 2005 and the program was up and running by may 2005
139935 i dont tell people who to take or when or how often
139936 participants can sign up at our web site and download a list of volunteers in their area its based on the buddy system
139937 its the biggest combine we have in fact its the only combine we have
139938 with the large size of equipment nowadays its cost prohibitive to harvest that little bit it would cost more to get the equipment into the field than the wheat is worth
139939 it seemed like a good idea and the museum can use the money
139940 i couldnt get anyone to harvest it last year so i plowed it under this is a volunteer crop thats pretty heavily seeded
139941 basically we have to have the auger and dump wagon because the auger on the combine isnt tall enough to boost the wheat into the gravity wagon
139942 ive never worked with a header this small but all in all its not entirely different you just have to make a lot more turns
139943 the message is not just about the tragedy of life being taken but also that god gives the power to heal and forgive
139944 so its not a message of condemnation but a message of calling people to turn to the hope forgiveness and love of christ
139945 ohne zu z gern nahm sie die jungen sofort an leckte sie ab und gab ihnen milch
139946 we have to be realistic its going to be a tough constituency but well do our best
139947 anwar has decided to take it to the people despite having the opportunity to clear his name using the processes available to him the accusations were made by his staff and not the government
139948 4 nach erfolgreichem abschluss des studiums kann die aufenthaltserlaubnis um bis zu einem jahr zur suche eines diesem abschluss angemessen arbeitsplatzes sofern er nach den bestimmungen der 18 19 und 21 von ausl ndern besetzt werden darf verl ngert werden absatz 3 gilt entsprechend 9 findet keine anwendung
139949 hes been exhibiting in open class since he was big enough to walk and carry a rabbit
139950 you have to make sure the animals are taken care of and you have to get to every event on time
139951 i cannot tell you what i would do except to put everything on the table
139952 there is nothing thats off the table i have my positions and ill articulate them but nothings off the table
139953 i dont want tax increases but that doesnt mean that anything is off the table
139954 shocking because you have been adamant in your opposition to raising taxes under any circumstances
139955 has a clear and demonstrated record of opposing tax increases john mccain is going to cut taxes
139956 le show biz isra l le pen et moi et moi et moi

139958 so you want a group of kind but clueless people who can only empathize with someones inability to print or connect to wifi
139959 widgets of the translator does not work young donkeys very well

139961 pasti ia sengaja ingin rasanya saya memukulnya karena itulah saya kalah
139962 seandainya garis ini adalah garis dari lawanmu coba bagaimana caramu agar garis lawanmu ini menjadi lebih pendek
139963 itulah masalahmu di setiap kompetisi yang kamu fokuskan adalah bagaimana memperpendek atau menjatuhkan lawan bukan memperpanjang garismu seharusnya panjangkan garismu dan tentunya garis lawanmu akan menjadi lebih pendek
