9200000 yeah well that and signing a loyalty oathll get me a cup of swill at a halliburton built detention facility one things for sure ill end up in one sooner rather than later if i write what im really thinking
9200001 whatever next all forsaken place the american imperialist war machine decides to pulverize into a fine radioactive dust whether iran or the oil rich plains of the planet gruptar i want the u s to get its ass kicked
9200002 that more u s soldiers would have to die for that to happen
9200003 yeah i get it but their fates and those of untold others were sealed by the jingoistic bloodlust of millions of american yahoos who mindlessly exhorted bushcos slaughter in iraq from the trumped up beginning sure the publics hinky now but thats mainly because gas prices rocket ever skyward no not until america suffers an undisputed all out thoroughly humiliating military defeat is there a chance its global rampage will finally be abated course there might not be a human left alive after such a confrontation but thats another matter
9200004 nor are a million dead innocents or the transformation of the cradle of civilization into a toxic waste dump or that such madness hardly dents the myopic american collective psyche the same appalling apathy that now allows vietnam to be retroactively recast as a righteous cause that should have been doggedly pursued until the freedom bestowing u s military could ultimately produce an honorable victory that in truth could only exist in the reptilian brains of bush and his neocon masters an orwellian reworking of history that first gained traction during the 2004 faux presidential campaign and steamrolls today with the glorification of the gops standard bearing buffoon john drop em if ya got em mccain as some untouchable hero
9200005 i get all that but what about the grieving families of u s military dead
9200006 heres the bloody bottom line anyone stupid and savage enough to join the military now to willingly participate in one mammoth war crime deserves everything he gets
9200007 plus that sort of talk could result in your property being confiscated as per bushs july 17 2007
9200008 undercover research on my new book inspired interestingly enough by the aforementioned craig as america goes down the toilet a between the stalls peek at gay bashing fascists who do the same in same
9200009 a bit unwieldy perhaps but its great to see youve not left the funny business altogether
9200010 no i guess not now if youll excuse me i need to google the floor plan for the xcel energy center in st paul minnesota
9200011 thats where the gop holds its convention next week the mens room there should be a gold mine
9200012 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
9200013 the fact of the matter is al qaida and the taliban the people who have actually attacked us on 9 11 note exactly the same wording as in the obama speech theyve regrouped in the mountains between afghanistan and pakistan and are plotting new attacks and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has echoed baracks call for more troops and john mccain was wrong and barack obama was right
9200014 to cover war costs into the early months of a new administration those amounts combined would represent the highest level of military spending since the end of world war ii adjusted for inflation
9200015 m ore resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11
9200016 now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education ill invest in early childhood education ill recruit an army of new teachers and pay them higher salaries and give them more support
9200017 lockheed martin strongly supports our nations political process and candidates that support in general national defense homeland security high technology and educational initiatives
9200018 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future these are the policies i will pursue and in the weeks ahead i look forward to debating them with john mccain
9200019 to present a different face to the world that could revive illusions in its democratic pretensions not only internationally but within the united states as well
9200020 stein meanwhile leaned against the lip of the auditoriums stage a study in negative body language to my eye he was a picture of ingrained smugness if there had been a button in the room that triggered a trap door to make the crowd disappear he would have hit it then breathed on his fingernails and polished them against his lapel

9200028 los adolescentes y los adultos j venes llegan a los servicios de emergencia con lesiones graves a veces fatales porque no prestan atenci n a su ambiente mientras reciben y env an mensajes de texto
9200029 recibimos gente que tropieza y cae de cara contra el pavimento sobre todo los que tienen entre 20 y 30 a os vemos muchas lesiones de cara mand bula boca y ojos
9200030 cada vez atendemos a m s personas que se abren la cabeza contra los toldos de los restaurantes que est n en las veredas porque iban caminando con la mirada puesta en el celular
9200031 hay dos situaciones potencialmente peligrosas que involucran a los peatones una es el acatamiento de las normas de tr nsito es decir si cruzan por la senda peatonal o por la mitad de la calle otra es lo que van haciendo mientras caminan si lo hacen mandando mensajes o escuchando m sica esto ltimo implica el desv o del foco de atenci n y supone un aumento de lesiones y siniestros
9200032 el conductor tiene el arma m s poderosa pero est claro que no es el nico que potencia el riesgo
9200033 es necesario empezar a tener en cuenta el efecto de este tipo de peatones
9200034 sus distracciones afectan directamente su foco de atenci n y esto repercute negativamente en el tr nsito est n tan conectados a esos tel fonos que les resuelven todo que se abstraen del entorno vial cruzan por la mitad de la calle no respetan sem foros y exponen a graves riesgos a quienes los rodean

9200053 pixies doolittle common guys try not to cater the the teeny bopper metal pop crowd and lets make this about really great music
9200054 i was trying to write the ultimate pop song i was basically trying to rip off the pixies
9200055 i include those languages because thats the way the world is i live and work in silicon valley ca one of the most integrated places in the world

9200060 what would that creature really look like how would it live
9200061 i dont know if its going to work with the story and we dont want her to come back for a visit if it doesnt feel important something only addison can do
9200062 it makes a lot of sense to change the map of the middle east
9200063 building a democracy that is based upon the notion of the rule of the majority is a disaster for us
9200064 there is a need to establish the soil under which the seeds of liberal democratic institutions can take root
9200065 bidens views on certain regional issues such as dividing iraq along sectarian lines and his staunch support for israel have disappointed arabs
9200066 however they trust that obama is not a war president they also recognise that biden is a sharp foreign policy man
9200067 obamas choice of deputy confirms that the real change he is after is a personal one to leap from his seat in the senate to the presidential chair
9200068 biden is a firm supporter of israel but the way he sees the uss role in the middle east doesnt necessarily reflect jerusalems ideal of the ideal american partner
9200069 while lieberman is a favourite on the single issue of israel biden is more in synch with jewish voters on the broad range of domestic and foreign policy issues
9200070 attempt to place himself in the light of practical policy rather than as the brash idealist many of us came to love
9200071 because the brash idealists are never successful so id like to think that his inner idealist is driving him
9200072 the united states has the least generous parental leave policies of all 21 economies compared in this study
9200073 we pay a high price for our poor policy though because parental leaves improve the health and well being of children and their parents and paid leaves provide families with crucial economic support at such an important time
9200074 one of the biggest shortcomings is that current law makes no provisions for paid leave some employers do pay but putting the full cost of parental leave on individual employers is neither fair nor efficient
9200075 in this case it was an arrest following an indictment by a grand jury
9200076 the grand jury may have been swayed by the revelation there was a brief gap between the time parks was jumped and the moment byas was stabbed
9200077 he was charged with murder wow im surprised they made this decision
9200078 i couldnt imagine that women of such talent and stature would be affected by getting older i learned that they did feel a switch but they were refusing to be defeated and taking control of their creative needs jada was directing for the first time meg was producing the women annette was about to do a play i found that inspiring
9200079 from the time we arrived in january there was a local demand for generators throughout the city
9200080 initially the project was sub divided by precincts and eventually it became a city wide project of providing the 35 generators
9200081 we trained and certified operators who are responsible for keeping residents connected and keeping the generator operating using preventive maintenance
9200082 the operators are obligated to ensuring the generators provide a minimum of seven hours of power on a daily basis to offset the shortage of national power

9200112 estoy seguro de que hay quien se preguntar por todo esto y entiendo si alguien se ofende admite stiller ya que fuera de contexto cualquiera puede preguntarse qu pasa aqu porque tenemos un actor blanco maquillado de negro de todos modos siempre tuvimos en claro cu l era nuestra intenci n y de d nde ven a el humor que iba a haber un actor que va demasiado lejos que se toma demasiado en serio y que cree que puede adoptar cualquier papel
9200113 iba a ser irland s se volvi australiano mientras est bamos filmando explica stiller por ello es que fue divertido cuando dej al personaje porque todav a ten a puesto el maquillaje y uno escuchaba el acento irland s fuera de contexto pero luego fue m s divertido cuando trabajamos para que se quedara dentro del personaje luego todo esto se convirti en su tema dentro de la pel cula esto de que ten a miedo en cierta forma de abandonar al personaje

9200122 women will play a pivotal role in this election and so will the planned parenthood action fund we are engaged in an aggressive effort to educate voters about senator mccains abysmal record on womens health and safety
9200123 senator mccain is no moderate hes voted in opposition to comprehensive sex education voted against expansion of birth control coverage to pregnant women on medicaid and fought against legislation that would provide emergency contraception to rape victims
9200124 this election will be critical to the health and safety of women and families from a supreme court that is one vote away from overturning roe v wade to the global gag rule that imposes crippling restrictions on family planning providers overseas the election of a new president ready willing and able to carry george bushs strident health care policies into the future will have far reaching ramifications at home and abroad

9200184 the release of our brother husam khader will strengthen palestinian action in the defense of the rights of palestinian refugees this is man accustomed to stand solidly and bravely he does not compromise on the right of return
9200185 the release of palestinian prisoners is an inevitable outcome of the palestinian struggle to uphold our rights
9200186 he was carrying the banner of the faithful to return the rights of refugees and a fierce defender here in the back yard of the darkest of circumstances this mans calling was to be solid and courageous in his positions
9200187 the release of the leader hussam khader is long awaited he has been the corner stone of the return movement which is a movement that is expanding day by day
9200188 live in the worst conditions and are subjected to all forms of humiliation and physical and psychological torture

9200215 the excitement was palpable among conservative leaders when they heard that gov palin was sen mccains choice for vice president there is a high level of optimism among conservative leaders that the mccain palin combination is a ticket that will connect with values voters gov palin is pro life and pro marriage

9200219 the love for justice that is in us is not only the best part of our being it is also the most true to our nature
9200220 of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive it may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies the robber barons cruelty may sometimes sleep his cupidity may at some point be satiated but those who torment us for own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience
9200221 freedom is not simply the right of intellectuals to circulate their merchandise
9200222 you can safely assume youve created god in your own image when it turns out that god hates all the same people you do
9200223 if the spirit is at peace though the body contend there is no violence but if the spirit is not at peace though the body be at rest there is always violence
9200224 i am a republican a black dyed in the wool republican and i never intend to belong to any other party than the party of freedom and progress
9200225 it isnt that liberals are ignorant its just that they know so much that isnt so
9200226 the urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule
9200227 the right to be heard does not automatically include the right to be taken seriously
9200228 a liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in a quarrel

9200233 sooner or later we all have to choose between what is right and what is easy
9200234 it is not a mistake to have strong views the mistake is to have nothing else
9200235 when people agree with me i always feel that i must be wrong
9200236 share the gospel at all times and when necessary use words
9200237 the early bird gets the worm but the second mouse gets the cheese
9200238 while we are free to do whatever we wish we are not free to have the consequences be whatever we want them to be
9200239 one of the many failings of our educational system is that it sends out into the world people who cannot tell rhetoric from reality
9200240 the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
9200241 every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world
9200242 a positive attitude may not solve all your problems but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort
9200243 sin can play a big role in making and keeping us humble a contrite spirit is desired by god in order for me to be contrite i must embrace the good and the bad in me and not take either too seriously
9200244 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
9200245 fanatacism consists in redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim
9200246 whereas it is essential if man is not to be compelled to have recourse as a last resort to rebellion against tyranny and oppression that human rights should be protected by the rule of law

9200445 it will take a few more months of data to determine if commercial real estate is ending its two year period of growth deceleration or is this just a temporary seasonal bounce
9200446 unlike prior cyclical downturns commercial real estate fundamentals remain relatively strong going into this downturn despite this strength commercial real estate is viewed as a lagging economic indicator and is subject to the effects of the broader economy there is growing concern about where commercial property net operating income might be trending given general economic conditions
9200447 real estate continues to face one of its biggest liquidity challenges in over a decade even though loan delinquencies to the sector are very low the ongoing lack of credit for real estate has led to weaker property values and has stalled transactions
9200448 despite current challenges we remain encouraged by u s real estate markets historical resilience
9200449 management believes that the full economic effect of the recent economic deterioration has yet to fully impact commercial real estate markets and as economic conditions are likely to weaken further commercial real estate market fundamentals should reflect a mild decline in the near term
9200450 current commercial real estate fundamentals have for the most part only been marginally affected and therefore suggest a capacity to weather these pressures while further erosion in employment would dilute the demand for space the effects may be mitigated by the modest flow of new construction due for delivery over the year ahead
9200451 the pace of decline has intensified due to job cuts and very sluggish economic activity since the beginning of the year particularly in those industries requiring commercial building spaces
9200452 we anticipate the weakest commercial brokerage activity in nearly three years as a result
9200453 the u s commercial real estate market continues to have an uneasy waiting for godot feeling about it
9200454 with the credit market troubles still hampering the orderly flow of capital and growing uncertainty about the near term outlook for the economy bid ask spreads have widened as activity throughout the commercial real estate market from lending to leasing to transactions has slowed to a crawl
9200455 though signs of distress remain largely confined to highly leveraged deals consummated at the peak of the investment cycle in late 2006 and early 2007 there is an undeniable and growing sense of anticipation among investors that u s commercial property values are poised to fall and that widespread distress is just around the corner
9200456 while todays low cap rates make it fairly easy to arrive at some sobering estimates for how far asset values can fall in the near term it remains to be seen what kind of role distress will play over the next year or two
9200457 property values already appear to have fallen 10 or more from the pricing at the peak of the market and they may continue to decline over the near term
9200458 but with property market fundamentals still relatively balanced a modest supply pipeline soaring construction costs and a wall of capital waiting in the wings prospective investors anticipating a repeat of the capital starved distress in the early 1990s and the deeply discounted transaction market it produced may be disappointed
9200459 his off stage presence whether real or imagined and his expected arrival largely dictate what does and does not happen in the play
9200460 to be sure more distress will surface in the transaction market before the credit market normalizes and the combination of higher capital costs and lower rent growth will depress asset values in the near term

9200681 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it

9200683 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

9200700 the game punishes you by making sure that simply flicking the remote down all the time never leads to any smooth lightsaber combat as a result it forces you to mix your swings to make combat flow better this may seem like bad game design but in fact its a clever way of forcing the player to feel more like theyre actually fighting with a lightsaber
9200701 theres a great sense of power felt when you can avoid fighting someone on cloud city if you simply use the force to pick them up and fling them off the edge of a platform
9200702 the main highlight for us is lifting the enemy up with the force then throwing our lightsaber at them impaling them as they float in the air
9200703 theres not a huge difference between the apprentices abilities at first and those he has by the time the story reaches its final chapter
9200704 dying has effectively no impact on your progress if you die you simply respawn at the last checkpoint and all the enemies you killed remain dead

9200711 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same

9200714 everywhere i look theres a new story about how screwed up the housing market is
9200715 for gods sake dont write this on your blog you freak
9200716 the whole obama narrative is built around the narrative that obama and campaign strategist david axelrod built and like all stories its not entirely true
9200717 his constituents the media and his political opponents to fully examine him
9200718 pattern of rarely volunteering information or documents even when relatively innocuous
9200719 as the president of the law review obama didnt write articles he edited and reviewed them
9200720 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9200721 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9200722 theres also this issue that on april 18 she palin gave birth to a baby with down syndrome the baby is just slightly more than 4 months old now children with down syndrome require an awful lot of attention the role of vice president it seems to me would take up an awful lot of her time and it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child
9200723 thats a very good question and i guess my guess is that perhaps the line inside the mccain campaign would be if it were a man being picked who also had a baby but you know four months ago with down syndrome would you ask the same question
9200724 wont even follow bin laden to the cave where he lives
9200725 its basically the equivalent of a midnight raid behind enemy lines
9200726 hillary said she made 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling well mccain just shattered it
9200727 both campaigns seemed to have decided that hillary clintons 18 million voters represent a key swing bloc in this election both barack obamas speech and john mccains pick were at least partially aimed at them
9200728 the fact that palin is pro life and pro gun will be a block for many of senator clintons supporters but not all and it will raise the question for many why senator obama didnt pick senator clinton as his running mate
9200729 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9200730 if the democrats are too stupid to break the glass ceiling for women we will do it for them

9200732 the broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush

9200807 toen ik in het programma van p amp w progressief kritisch noemen de makers ervan zich echter hoorde hoe jij tegen het hedendaagse terrorisme aankijkt en daar zelfs een rechtvaardiging in ziet van legitiem verzet dacht ik deze salah edin gebruikt wel een heel opmerkelijke voedingsbodem voor zijn artistieke talenten ik noem die voedingsbodem een postkoloniale pro islamitische emancipatiedoctrine toen jou op de man af werd gevraagd wat je van de daad van mohammed b vond antwoordde jij als moslim keur ik dit af maar ja en toen wist ik eigenlijk al waar het gesprek met jou op zou uitdraaien en op welke plek de naald in de groef zou blijven steken het is de zovaak gehoorde tegenstelling ik heb er geen begrip voor m r kan het wel begrijpen de argumenten die jij er voor aandroeg vond ik eerlijk gezegd alles behalve overtuigend zo zei jij je weet nu eenmaal niet wat er in het hoofd van mensen omgaat en de ene vat het zo op toegespitst op de denkbeelden van theo van gogh en de ander gaat er nu eenmaal zo mee om ik dacht ja ja de zoveelste in het rijtje van mensen die moord en verderf als een legitiem wapen zien om mensen die er andere opvattingen op na houden letterlijk het zwijgen op te leggen de aan bin laden en zijn al kaida gang van muslimbrothers toegeschreven terroristische aanslagen te weten mohammed atta de egyptenaar die het vliegtuig bestuurde dat de noordelijke toren van het world trade center raakte marwan al shehhi afkomstig uit de verenigde arabische emiraten die zijn vliegtuig de zuidelijke toren instuurde ziad jarrah uit libanon die vlucht 93 van united airlines bij shanksville pennsylvania liet neerstorten en hun vrienden ramzi binalshibh een jemeniet en de marrokaanse student mounir al motassedeq zie jij als een daad van pure zelfverdediging ik vraag je hoe kunnen de duizenden willekeurige slachtoffers van deze weerzinwekkende daad or for that matter de slachtoffers van de mohammed bs in deze wereld ooit nog het gesprek aangaan natuurlijk zul jij denken maar de vs doen toch omgekeerd hetzelfde al zou dit zo zijn wat ik ernstig waag te betwijfelen dan nog is mijn vraag aan jouw hoe kun jij het vergelden van kwaad met kwaad rechtvaardigen hoe kun jij bloedvergieten met bloedvergieten beantwoorden als jij zegt dat jij wilt dat mensen met elkaar het gesprek aangaan jou frustraties jegens de zogenaamde blanke hegemonie is niet nieuw echter er zijn maar weinigen die vanuit die frustraties erin slagen op een vreedzame manier een brug te slaan tussen blank en gekleurd beluister ik jouw teksten dan slaag ook jij er niet in om op een verdraagzame wijze de kloof te dichten die door woede uitsluiting onderdrukking discriminatie etc tussen de verschillende bevolkingsgroepen wordt geslagen de manier waarop jij jezelf met mohammad b hebt trachten te vereenzelvigen toont dit voor wat mij betreft duidelijk aan je zegt wel gemakshalve dat jij je daarvoor ook in de persoon van theo van gogh hebt verplaatst maar daar hoor ik in jouw tekst en ook niet in jouw verklaring ervan achteraf niets van terug de rijmelarij waarmee jij jouw frustraties de wereld in dist hebben voor mij niet de diepgang die jij er zelf in zegt te hebben willen leggen het is niet uit het hart maar het zijn m i teksten die ontstaan uit een ideologische disconnection met de open nederlandse samenleving waar nu eenmaal niet alles draait om de teergevoeligheid van een klein groepje anti sociale moslims dat jij zegt te spreken namens alle moslims is vanuit marketing technisch oogpunt heel wel begrijpelijk maar feitelijk natuurlijk volkomen onjuist jij stelt jouw eigen ongenoegens met onze samenleving centraal en scheert dan vervolgens alle moslims over een kam door te beweren dat zij er precies zo tegen aankijken als voorbeeld noemde jij de vertoning van de film submission de kern van deze verwrongen generalisatie is echter dat jij anderen wilt verbieden wat jij omgekeerd jezelf en de jouwen wilt toestaan dit noem ik schijnheilig en typisch voor een deel van de militante gelovigen die hun geloof met hand en tand willen verdedigen en daarnaast anderen vaak met geweld hun opvattingen willen opdringen jij misbruikt jouw geloof dus feitelijk als een intolerante bekeringsideologie doorspekt met extreem explosieve boodschappen je zegt terecht dat het moeilijk is te achterhalen wat er in iemands hoofd omgaat maar juist daarom zou jij jezelf er veel meer rekenschap van moeten geven dat jouw teksten deze of gene het hoofd heel makkelijk op hol kunnen brengen ik kreeg tijdens het gesprek bij p amp w de stellige indruk dat jij je daar totaal niet van bewust lijkt te zijn dat je dus nauwelijks enig benul hebt wat de brisante teksten bij de willekeurige enkeling aan kwalijke gevolgen kunne oproepen in gewoon nederlands je speelt met vuur zonder dat je het in de gaten hebt wat je met mijn reactie doet moet je natuurlijk zelf weten maar ik kon het niet laten van mijn vrijheid van meningsuiting gebruik te maken en je mijn gedachten ter overweging mee te geven
9200808 but in islam war is waged to establish supremacy of the lord only when every other argument has failed to convince those who reject his will and work against the very purpose of the creation of mankind
9200809 many western scholars have pointed their accusing fingers at some of the above verses in the quran to be able to contend that world of islam is in a state of perpetual struggle against the non muslims as to them it is a sufficient answer to make that the defiance of gods authority by one who is his slaves exposes that slave to the risk of being held guilty of treason and as such a one in the perspective of islamic law is indeed to be treated as a sort of that cancerous growth on that organism of humanity it thus becomes necessary to remove the cancerous malformation even if it be by surgical means in order to save the rest of humanity

9200835 americans views on the economy and the general state of the country have hit an all time low
9200836 we need to go back to the prosperity of the 1990s
9200837 it could be about a kid from a small town who dreams of being a rock star and he wins the guitar hero competition one of these dreams come true kind of concepts

9200839 the world and most zimbabweans pray for a free and fair election not marred by violence and intimidation as in the past
9200840 we urge the sadc observers to produce a report characterised by integrity and honestly we have let down the suffering people of zimbabwe for too long already they deserve better
9200841 since the runoff was announced the violence in zimbabwe has gotten even worse zimbabweans cant vote freely if they fear their vote may get them killed
9200842 the only new but absurd suggestion from the mdc was that the cabinet be co chaired by president mugabe and tsvangirai
9200843 zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9200844 i am not at liberty to outline any of our positions until i get the green light from my authorities
9200845 our negotiators are still in pretoria which suggests to me that the consultations are still going on i have not been in touch with any of them today so i cannot confirm the exact position of the talks
9200846 it zanu pf said from its perspective all that remained was for the mdc to append its signature to the document or withhold it for as long as it likes knowing fully well that the process of forming a government would proceed unhindered
9200847 knowing the price of everything but the value of nothing
9200848 rich countries must reduce if not eliminate distortional agriculture and energy policies and help those in the poorest countries improve their capacity to produce food but this is just a start we have treated our most precious resources clean air and water as if they were free only new patterns of consumption and production a new economic model can address that most fundamental resource problem
9200849 i have heard that people may become dependent on us for food to me that is good news because before people can do anything they have got to eat and if you are looking for a way to get people to lean on you and be dependent on you in terms of their own cooperation with you it seems to me that food dependence would be terrific
9200850 those in the poorest countries improve their capacities to produce food
9200851 let us remember that the main purpose of aid is not to help other nations but to help ourselves
9200852 the push by some developing countries to become more self sufficient in food may be reminiscent of a bygone era these countries could save money by importing more food from the us
9200853 food self sufficiency is a peculiarly obtuse way of thinking about food security
9200854 there are situations in which self sufficiency is important such as during wars at one stage in the second world war there was a real danger of britain not being able to get enough food into the country but that is a very peculiar situation and we are not in one like that now nor are we likely to be in the near future

9200861 they the mccain campaign dont care about her lack of experience they want the democrats to attack her experience because it draws comparisons to obama the longer they can keep the inexperience debate alive the better theyll do
9200862 its like when the campaign makes any remark about obamas race next thing you know the obama campaign is crying racism and the mccain campaign is saying how could you say that about john mccain guess what folks you just spent the last two days reminding voters who care that obama is black
9200863 well guess what folks we just spent the last two days talking about experience which all of a sudden matters to the democrats they are broadcasting a message to the electorate that experience matters by way of their criticism of palin all their criticism is going to boomerang around and smack obama in the mouth the more time that is spent comparing obama and palin

9200905 there are two things that motivate inspiration and desperation and desperation is a far greater motivator
9200906 what mccain does not understand is that women supported hillary clinton not just because she was a woman but because she was a champion on their issues they will surely not find sarah palin to be an advocate for women
9200907 former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9200908 in picking an unknown untested half a term governor from alaska john mccain is following in a long line of reckless men who have rolled the dice for a beauty queen
9200909 just wait until she is debating joe biden and he starts attacking or condescending to her
9200910 what happened in the early hours today is a despicable and cowardly act that endangered innocent peoples lives
9200911 the cutting of the brake lines was intended to at the very least to severely injure people who have chosen to participate in one of the most important processes this country has to offer to its citizens they chose to exercise this right and have a political sign on their lawn we live in a lawful and peaceful society where we have the freedom to express ourselves politically no one should be subject to this kind of violence and intimidation
9200912 i join frank valeriote in condemning these vicious attacks in ourcommunity
9200913 the vandalism to political signs and the targeting of private homes and property must stop immediately this kind of activity has nothing to do with the ndp or the liberals were sad to see politics take such an ugly turn we hope the police will find the criminals responsible and prosecute them to the full extent of the law
9200914 greens totally disapprove of any acts of vandalism political motivated attacks on peoples homes and property insults the values that canadians hold sacred regarding safe a free elections
9200915 this is an escalation in behaviour and his kind of activity has no place in guelph especially whe we all strive for free and fair process

9200919 i believe sarah palin has the qualifications to be president but i think its time for john mccain to stop the smears and admit that everyone on our tickets do the american people deserve better
9200920 if you think sarah palin is ready to lead how can you say obama isnt

9200928 my friends anyone who lives in secretary and is its mayor obviously qualifies to be my secretary
9200929 all i know is that obama made his first executive decision and picked joe biden mccain made his first executive decision and picked sarah who
9200930 hey good job gluing back together that ming vase you broke
9200931 delawareliberal has always been and will always be less partisan than delawarepolitics and that mirrors our party orientations and philosophies
9200932 one of the smartest guys writing on the national reviews corner
9200933 obamas lack of readiness was the only way to win
9200934 she was mayor of a small town 20 months ago and if mccain palin somehow won she could be the president in 6 months
9200935 well she was running for city council in 1992 thats 16 years ago
9200936 i aint voting for miss congeniality just because i cant vote for miss universe

9200938 once again republicans are being disingenuous experience as a governor is not experience as commander in chief that notion is laughable
9200939 once again republicans are being disingenuous experience as a governor is not experience as commander in chief that notion is laughable governors can call out the national guard but they are not the commanders in chief of the national guard the president retains that power
9200940 presidents and governors take recommendations from the people they place around them for they do not have enough hours in the day to become a real time strategic and tactical expert on all things all the time
9200941 affections that are truly spiritual and gracious do arise from those influences and operations of the heart which are spiritual supernatural and divine
9200942 from these things it is evident that those gracious influences which the saints are subjects of and the effects of gods spirit which they experience are entirely above nature altogether of a different kind from anything that men find within themselves by nature or only in the exercise of natural principles and are things which no improvement of those qualifications or principles that are natural no advancing or exalting them to higher degrees and no kind of composition of them will ever bring men to because they not only differ from what is natural and from everything that natural men experience in degree and circumstances but also in kind and are of a nature vastly more excellent and this is what i mean by supernatural when i say that gracious affections are from those influences that are supernatural

9200950 so you could wait a few years resist the new trends talk about how great things were back in your day or you could embrace the new rules and be a part of the change
9200951 ultimately a business or an organization is a reflection of its leader the leader has to make personal changes before an organization as a whole can improve productivity systems if not the leader will constantly undermine any systemic improvements
9200952 it seems that profanity can work as a record button for the brain it brings people to the edge of their attention as theyre trying to figure out whether theyre supposed to be offended or inspired and then the content warrants the emphasis the idea seems to stick better and longer and with more affection
9200953 you can see the catch 22 cant you its that big obvious thing heading straight at us young people dont want to wait around for meaning so they leave employers dont want to give their new people big projects because new people are notorious for leaving after a few months on the job
9200954 but as a longstanding contractor myself theres one rule of thumb that i try to keep in mind when choosing between potential jobs only take a job where youll learn something
9200955 the state of privacy in the 21st century is a worldwide concern given the internets global reach although several key themes emerge when examining the impact of technology on privacy and security including cyber crime and crime fighting the application of old privacy laws to new technologies and whether companies can share customer data without consent different countries find themselves grappling with distinct problems
9200956 being a digital nomad used to mean either a traveling salesperson or perhaps the occasional work at home employee today it means all of the above but it adds a caveat that includes capitalizing on connectivity and opportunity regardless of your location who can respond to multiple conversations the fastest and who can create solutions and opportunity for less
9200957 the break up of behemoth vertically integrated enterprises commenced in the 1970s got a boost from junk bond financing in the 1980s and accelerated in the 1990s with globalization now late in the 2000s social media aka web 2 0 is adding another gear that will accelerate the fundamental restructuring of the enterprise

9200959 i know there were some things written about me being injured i dont know where that came from because i wasnt injured
9200960 maybe my left ankle is not the greatest but i was more than fine to play how much i played was really a coachs decision
9200961 i had a game plan for myself but i guess it wasnt the same as the coachs plan my playing had nothing to do with my ankle it was just how the coach made the lineup
9200962 many americans are worried about the health of our housing and job markets i share these concerns about our economy yet there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve

9200990 you know who was a pacifist neville chamberlain good luck with that
9200991 my concern is that when you expand eligibility youre really beginning to open up an avenue for people to switch from private insurance to the government
9200992 tax legislation to expand health insurance coverage is badly needed but theres no democratic support for it in the schip debate
9200993 in the meantime our schip initiative in the finance committee takes care of a program thats about to expire in a way thats more responsible than current law and 15 billion less than the budget resolution calls for
9200994 i cant speak to some of the complaints the surgeon general made
9200995 he worked energetically in his job and obviously at some point in time he became very disgruntled and spoke out about it but ours is an administration that attracts very smart capable people im very interested in their points of view and i expect people to speak out i also have my own points of view and feel very strongly about a lot of issues

9201013 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington
9201014 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9201015 i think thats a plus in her favor with conservatives
9201016 sen mccains selection of alaska gov sarah palin is an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base of his party
9201017 i think shes a mile wide and about an inch deep
9201018 but she has the alaskan touch shes a hockey mom she hunts she fishes her husband is a mans man her son joined the army these are powerful images that resonate with a lot of people
9201019 speaking her own mind and then worrying about whether its popular afterward
9201020 i want people here to know that im gonna be fighting as hard as i can for them and joe biden is gonna be fighting as hard as he can for them to create new jobs in high growth industries like clean energy

9201022 obama gave a great speech of course i wanted a woman i would have liked to see hillary be the candidate
9201023 oh my god my father in law is going to be so jealous hes a big mccain supporter
9201024 ok buckeye fans lets give sen mccain a big o h
9201025 this choice makes me consider him when i was pretty much on the obama bus
9201026 i like mccain i just had some worries about his age i like her youth the fact that she is a woman and her strong morals are very important

9201041 its a definite game changer not only for the pro life movement but for the gop base here in ohio
9201042 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path

9201079 i guess the real main difference about the power dress is that its a structural masterpiece in that it gives women a waist and it flares out over the hips and the butt so it covers the areas that women dont really want to show off
9201080 the fabrics are thick and it holds the body in shape beautiful structured lines
9201081 its like the old corsets do you know what i mean it holds all the body into shape
9201082 firstly with this its still that strong silhouette and also with the strapping here weve done this strapping so that its a really nice line but also slimming on you with the bust its all darted and everything which makes your bustline look a lot more sharper and then with the bottom of it weve got panels which does the line on your body which makes you look slimmer

9201134 this type of t hing changes you i didnt come out bitter or losing my bearings im not saying that everything is absolutely fine substance abuse is not a good thing thats a good change

9201136 it is a lot easier to rationalize something away when you are in the front row watching michael jordan play basketball
9201137 thats sad to say but if i can kind of spend the next many years at least being honest about whats happened hopefully whatever does come about for my life i can live with that
9201138 i lived in this insular world where everything was simple because it was based around bobs best interests
9201139 so it was kind of like i thought if i could get away from some of that even if its going to abramoff somehow i could get into a better place
9201140 but my priority was not i want to be the most ethical staffer lobbyist in washington if that had been my priority i never would have gone to work for team abramoff

9201146 i am not hiding from that but i also knew that i looked long and hard at myself i was committed to doing what i knew i could live with when i was 50 and 60 and 70 years old

9201163 das gewaltdogma und der imperiale islam beginnt mit der auswanderung mohammeds nach medina im jahr 622 n chr von diesem zeitpunkt an hatte der ruf des islam gegen ber der welt immer mit der dualistischen option zu tun entweder dieser gloriosen religion beizutreten oder politischem druck und gewaltt tigkeit ausgeliefert zu sein
9201164 nach der auswanderung nach medina wurde der islam gewaltt tig nachdem seine berzeugungskraft versagt hatte der jihad betrat die weltb hne
9201165 jihad zerst rte den christlichen mittleren osten und ein christliches nordafrika dann kamen die persischen zoroastrier und die hindus an die reihe die geschichte des politischen islam ist die zerst rung der christenheit des mittleren ostens gyptens der t rkei und nordafrikas die halbe christenheit war dahin
9201166 vor dem islam war nordafrika der s dliche teil europas d h des r mischen reiches rund 60 millionen christen wurden w hrend der eroberungsz ge durch jihad vernichtet
9201167 die h lfte der glorreichen hinduzivilisation wurde ausradiert 80 millionen hindus wurden umgebracht
9201168 jihad zerst rte den ganzen buddhismus entlang der seidenstrasse zirka 10 millionen buddhisten kamen um die bezwingung des buddhismus ist das praktische resultat von pazifismus
9201169 innerhalb des islam wurden die juden zu immerw hrenden dhimmis
9201170 in afrika fielen w hrend der letzten 1400 jahren ber 120 millionen christen und animisten dem jihad zum opfer
9201171 ungef hr 270 millionen ungl ubige starben w hrend der letzten 1400 jahren f r den ruhm des politischen islam
9201172 unsere intellektuellen des fr hen mittelalters deren l nder von den heranst rmenden fanatisierten anh ngern mohammads berrannt wurden konnten die muslimischen eroberer noch nicht einmal mit namen nennen
9201173 auch heute haben wir keine methode den islam zu analysieren wir kommen im westen nicht berein was den islam ausmacht und wir haben keine kenntnisse ber die leiden der opfer eines 1400 jahre dauernden jihad
9201174 die juden haben eine theologie welche eine einzigartige beziehung zwischen ihnen und ihrem sch pfergott hergestellt hat
9201175 der islam jedoch betrachtet die juden als affen welche das alte testament korrumpiert haben die juden k nnen den zusammenhang zwischen islamischer politischer doktrin und der situation von israel nicht erkennen
9201176 deswegen ist es au erordentlich wichtig dass wir die doktrin des politischen islam verstehen lernen
9201177 der politische islam hat s mtliche kulturen welche er erobert hat oder in die er eingewandert ist vernichtet die gesamtzeit dieser vernichtung kann mehrere jahrhunderte dauern wenn der islam jedoch einmal im aufstieg begriffen ist versagt er nie die gastkultur verschwindet und stirbt aus
9201178 wir m ssen die doktrin unserer feinde kennen oder wir werden vernichtet werden
9201179 die moschee wird symbol des furchtlosen friedlichen und vertrauensvollen zusammenlebens sein ein ort der begegnung und kommunikation
9201180 mir ist v llig egal was mit euch geschieht ihr seid selbst schuld
9201181 dazu pa t auch ins bild da die angreifer schon kurz nach dem aufstellen des infostandes kamen denn ort und termine unserer infost nde sind ja eigentlich nur der stadtverwaltung von spd oberb rgermeister k chler bekannt ich frage mich ernsthaft wieweit die etablierte politik im wechselspiel mit linksextremen gewaltt tern diese eskalation im politischen meinungsstreit noch vorantreiben will
9201182 wir lassen uns weder von schikanen durch cdu spd und co noch von linksextremen gewaltt tern unser recht auf meinungsfreiheit streitig machen wir verteidigen statt dessen elementare demokratische grundrechte gegen einen regelrechten stra enterror im namen einer verlogenen politcal correctness eingeworfene fensterscheiben im pro k ln fraktionsb ro ein bewu tlos geschlagener pro k ln stadtrat vor einer woche und nun dieser erneute brutale berfall mit zwei verletzten pro nrw spitzenfunktion ren als folge wollen etwa k chler und co zusehen wie auf diese weise ihr unliebsamer mitbewerber um das oberb rgermeisteramt j rg uckermann zum verzicht auf seine kandidatur gepr gelt werden soll ich frage ganz im ernst und ohne jene polemik jeden pressevertreter jeden politiker und alle b rger leverkusens und des rheinlandes sind wir wirklich noch so weit entfernt von den zust nden in wei ru land simbabwe oder china hier wie dort werden unliebsame oppositionspolitiker zusammengeschlagen b ros von oppositionellen angegriffen und besch digt versammlungsr ume gek ndigt oder beh rdliche schikanen angeordnet ist das der weg den wir hier in deutschland wirklich einschlagen wollen soll es zum standart in der politischen auseinandersetzung werden da sich die mehrheitsvertreter von cdu spd fdp und gr nen ausdr cklich gegen eine resolution zum gewaltverzicht in der politik aussprechen wie erst vorgestern in der k lner ratssitzung geschehen jetzt ist der zeitpunkt da wo jeder ehrlich berzeugte demokrat einspruch anmelden m te auch wenn es sich um eine ungeliebte politisch nicht korrekte konkurrenz handelt und ich sage auch ganz klar ich erwarte an dieser stelle endlich einmal klare und mahnende worte der evangelischen und katholischen kirchenvertreter die zu solchen berf llen bisher eisern geschwiegen und sich im gegenteil mancherorts sogar noch an primitiven hetzkampagnen gegen angesehene christliche pro k ln und pro nrw mitglieder beteiligt haben hier g be es eine einmalige gelegenheit christliche charakterst rke und echte zivilcourage zu zeigen gegen den strom des zeitgeistes zu schwimmen und politische minderheiten in schutz zu nehmen es wird sich ja zeigen wieviel politischer anstand bei den m chtigen in unserem land noch vorhanden ist dessen ungeachtet gehen wir unseren weg weiter wohl wissend da wir in vielen fragen die mehrheitsmeinung der einheimischen bev lkerung vertreten und in der gewi heit da es in ganz nrw ein w hlerpotential von bis zu 20 prozent f r einen seri sen rechtsdemokratischen politikansatz gibt diesem teil der bev lkerung werden wir eine kr ftige stimme verleihen sowohl in leverkusen als auch in k ln und ganz nrw

9201197 aint it awful i cant have the car job relationship income happiness i desire
9201198 i find it funny that so many want to bash tt originally because brett favre is not here claiming that the season would have been a superbowl season moronic prediction
9201199 hes a rook rodgers was once a rookie too he didnt look good either now he looks so good it made getting rid of brett favre not only palatable but downright tasty rodgers rocks
9201200 nobodys proclaiming rodgers to be the equivalent of favre that would be very stupid
9201201 for anyone to even suggest hes brett favre has no idea what theyre talking about
9201202 so why is it a moronic prediction for these green bay packers
9201203 you just didnt like the fact that marino elway and montana are all better than favre at the fourth quarter comeback
9201204 i want to know why you are still arguing about this topic after it is over and freakin done with
9201205 fof who on earth brought up all the other qbs
9201206 for this year yes ill take rodgers over favre in a heartbeat thank you very much
9201207 look around man favre is a jet rodgers is our starter and everyone has moved on except you
9201208 you seem like a fairly smart articulate guy im pretty sure that if you chose to add your voice to the discussions of stuff thats going on right now you could be a valued member of this online group
9201209 as you can see i refuse to even address the rodgers vs favre issue that you raised it does not matter
9201210 this is a packer forum expacker fans are not welcomed
9201211 the packers staff felt it was time to move on brett could not get over that he didnt have a say in the teams aquisitions like he did under sherman
9201212 hes looked worse and worse in cold weather what the packer generally play in late season
9201213 his playoff track record in the last 10 years is horrible and hes had tendancies to make ill advised throws often
9201214 hes also 39 and the chances of him taking the packers to the sb and winning is slim

9201225 the day before the convention youll see a hundred of em pop up
9201226 any convention the science convention maybe not but the medical convention its just youre going to be making more money
9201227 ive definitely had a lot of inquiries for that time frame
9201228 women are going to be looking for better clientele not so much b s better money
9201229 i probably would feel safer at the convention than seeing someone in north minneapolis
9201230 its going to pick up no question its the money its the money game
9201231 we heard this could be a trend but in checking with new york and boston the sites of the 2004 republican and democratic conventions we found that was not the case the st paul advance team went there that was one of the things they specifically asked about
9201232 im not anticipating it will be any worse than it is now
9201233 they police dont know really whats going on in the undercover world
9201234 i have two or three girlfriends coming in from chicago im sure they will do a sweep but that wont stop people from coming in from out of town
9201235 any police theyll have their hands full monitoring the convention whatever is going on will go on behind closed doors on the internet over the phone
9201236 they prostitutes are not going to be out walking on the street minnesotas never been like that except for in your drug areas

9201244 could it be because they think palin is attractive serious question
9201245 like putting obama at the top of the ticket wasnt shameless pandering
9201246 dwbh said these arent a mixed bag nate theyre actually pretty good numbers for mccain 53 26 favorability numbers are pretty impressive
9201247 could it be because they think palin is attractive serious question
9201248 like putting obama at the top of the ticket wasnt shameless pandering
9201249 the only thing that could bring these numbers down seriously would be troopergate but so far based on only one poll this looks lke a slight win for mccain
9201250 rhys i know democrat hacks hate attractive women but try to contain your hatred
9201251 like putting obama at the top of the ticket wasnt shameless pandering
9201252 can you imagine what mccain would have said about her experience in a primary debate
9201253 and so far it looks like shell bring slightly more voters in than shell draw away
9201254 like putting obama at the top of the ticket wasnt shameless pandering
9201255 well pro life positions generally draw in more men than women
9201256 the palin choice effectively is an insult to women it says look nice wear dark colors be friendly and know your position then we will tolerate you to share some power
9201257 do you guys really think freshman irish catholic senator from illinois brian obama would have won the democrat primary
9201258 you guys are taking that quote out of context what she meant was she wanted to know what mccain would ask her to do not what the constitutional requirements of the office were
9201259 let me tell you governor its a pretty big job
9201260 what the vp does is different in evey administration ex quayle had far less authority than gore who had far less authority than cheney
9201261 do you guys really think freshman irish catholic senator from illinois brian obama would have won the democrat primary
9201262 this just proves everything weve known about conservatives for years now nothing matters except the fact that shes part of the tribe
9201263 do you guys really think freshman irish catholic senator from illinois brian obama would have won the democrat primary
9201264 brian obama would not have gotten the black vote from hillary and he would have come in second place were he a white irish catholic
9201265 sarah palin is for drilling here and drilling now that makes her strong on economic policy
9201266 no one knows sarah palin yet and shes already getting rave reviews
9201267 what she meant was she wanted to know what mccain would ask her to do not what the constitutional requirements of the office were
9201268 choosing sarah palin changed the entire scope of this election now who spent a gajillion dollars to speak where
9201269 well pro life positions generally draw in more men than women
9201270 energy is the economic issue of our time and palin is an expert on it
9201271 the numbers are little changed since yesterday and show barack obama attracting 47 of the vote nationwide while john mccain earns 43
9201272 why dont you take a look to see who she defeated to become governor
9201273 tying mccain to a third bush term is pure rubbish
9201274 as for voters not affiliated with either major party 37 are more likely to vote for mccain and 28 less likely to do so

9201279 la commedia delle intercettazioni il pi popolare reality show della politica italiana
9201280 sia giusto tollerare che uno strumento dindagine destinato a favorire la ricerca della verit venga usato per seminare dubbi alimentare chiacchiere e attizzare polemiche
9201281 lopposizione rifiuta la solidariet per colpire in modo strumentale lavversario politico berlusconi bene che la politica ci pensi da sola con una legge che in linea di principio non difficile immaginare e scrivere
9201282 prodi dicendosi indifferente alla pubblicazione delle intercettazioni ha dato la sensazione di voler svalutare i sentimenti di solidariet offerti da berlusconi ma questo secondo lencomiabile sergio romano un problema nazionale che occorre affrontare con seriet e senza secondi fini lopposizione trover altri temi su cui dissentire dal governo e fare le proprie battaglie sul problema delle intercettazioni ha il dovere di lavorare in parlamento per una legge che spenga le luci accese su questo brutto reality show

9201289 how could serious libraries be doing this how could they abdicate their responsibilities as custodians of the worlds knowledge by offering their collections up as a sacrifice on the altar of corporate power why dont they join the virtuous ranks of the open content alliance partners who pay thousands of dollars to digitize books at a rate of tens of thousands of volumes a year
9201290 scanning the great libraries is a wonderful idea but if only one corporation controls access to this digital collection well have handed too much control to a private entity
9201291 libraries should not be relinquishing their core duties to private corporations for the sake of expediency
9201292 as part of our arrangement with google they give us copies of all the digital files
9201293 in the meantime it seems to me that being in bed with google is way better than sleeping alone
9201294 university shall develop methods and system for ensuring that substantial portions of the university digital copy are not downloaded from the services offered on universitys website or otherwise disseminated to the public at large

9201347 people usually talk about how the internet destroys intellectual property
9201348 but here the internet enforces intellectual property it helps to protect creativity by shaming pirates
9201349 ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe for the moral and mutual instruction of man
9201350 allows a market in cultural property but also puts an outer boundary on that market
9201351 congress is perfectly happy to give ever larger ever stronger ever more stringent protections to big business often at the expense of the public domain
9201352 the piracy paradox innovation and intellectual property in fashion design
9201353 free culture how big media uses technology and the law to lock down culture and control creativity
9201354 if you can show that creativity flourishes without strong ip rights that casts doubt on the reflexive argument that we always need strong laws to stimulate creativity
9201355 seem to function vibrantly in the closely knit culinary realm where the esteem of ones peers and the opinions of diners work to both dissuade rampant copying and promote true innovation
9201356 in the magic community innovation does in fact need intellectual property
9201357 hairstyles which typically originate with celebrities are freely copied by barbers and hairstylists
9201358 a world has to be sufficiently closed and intermarried for its members to enforce behavioral norms
9201359 that might work in the culinary arts but i cant think of any huge industry that has a workable norms based system
9201360 people think of intellectual property as a way to deal with a form of market failure without legal controls we can expect less innovation

9201495 we are pleased to see that the uk registry is growing year on year this coupled with the high level of consumer trust in uk emphasizes the value of businesses having a co uk domain name it has become a key element of a uk based companys brand identity
9201496 we chose a uk domain name to give the web site a local feel underlining our uk basis a uk site is something our customers recognize and trust which means they are more likely to visit our site and book driving lessons
9201497 over the recent years we have seen a sizable increase in uk registration numbers as commercial businesses non profit organizations and bloggers who want to highlight their unique british web identity snap up uk domain name extensions

9201531 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9201532 this is one emergency that we cant drill our way out of
9201533 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people
9201534 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
9201535 a president who ends the global scourge of aids in our time
9201536 the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9201537 but surely we can agree that our gay brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9201538 were corrupting more and more people to care about this stuff
9201539 the release of carbon dioxide is massive in this country
9201540 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
9201541 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
9201542 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
9201543 as a follow up to my below post picking a female vp makes it very difficult for obama to execute the second part of his strategy painting mccain as the same as bush
9201544 maybe they wont notice that i am taking john mccains straight talk express campaign themes
9201545 i dont think so america knows mccain just sold out the country for a politic tactical stunt the woman has no experience on diversity of economics no national experience with any issue if the 72 year old kicks the bucket so would we as a country this woman is soooooo under qualified
9201546 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses
9201547 innovation in both business methodology and technology is capable of having profound effects on the degree that society adopts a truly green lifestyle and so we are excited to bring clean technology and innovation together at this years west coast green
9201548 it was definitely the longest speech ive seen him do and he did pull on a lot of heart strings
9201549 i would have liked to seen it more fact based but hes definitely leadership material
9201550 im a bit of an environmentalist so i really enjoy his movies and lectures he is a tad full of himself though
9201551 i really enjoyed governor schweitzer of montanas speech because he seems very down to earth
9201552 i really enjoyed hillarys speech as well talking about how her campaign and baracks campaign are about helping others it was really classy
9201553 he got over his personal conflicts with obama and stepped up and did what was right for the party and the country in typical bill clinton fashion
9201554 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
9201555 the other 52 percent will say she damaged him too much and five or six of us will say you should have let us do our job
9201556 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to be president thats a debate id like to have
9201557 people think they can support him but hes a mystery inexperience is about not knowing him
9201558 wont even follow bin laden to the cave where he lives
9201559 oh can you take care of her oh maybe you can spare her several moments of your consideration leading up to the final destination
9201560 oh the earth is calling out i wanna learn what its all about but everything i read global warming going green i dont know what all this means but it seems to be saying wake up america
9201561 hes a hero hes going to bring pollution down to zero
9201562 i know that you dont want to hear it especially coming from someone so young
9201563 stand up ill try if you will wake up its not a fire drill
9201564 seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9201565 the question for the american people is whether they can make this odyssey that democratic delegates to the convention made seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9201566 to put conservative values and conservative ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity
9201567 they had their chance they have not led we will
9201568 on occasion he rambled through excessive repetition bush is most effective in personal contact not a set speech
9201569 how and what we do for all of you the people who pay the taxes bear the burdens and live the american dream
9201570 cant understand how a guy like george w bush can be leading a guy with the kind of caliber experience and know how as al gore
9201571 make sure that our prosperity enriches not just the few but all working families
9201572 i believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning
9201573 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
9201574 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
9201575 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
9201576 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
9201577 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
9201578 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
9201579 gov crist now has an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the florida supreme court much like president bush has been able to do on the u s supreme court
9201580 hell be able to pick people who reflect his judgment and his conservative principles
9201581 theres no better way to accentuate your beliefs than with appointments to the court
9201582 this has not been a partisan court if i thought we were getting ideologues on the court id be concerned
9201583 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9201584 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
9201585 hes said many times that the primary battle was historic and exciting and that in the end result it would be good for the democratic party that it would energize a lot of people and bring a lot of new people out
9201586 he expected all along that this would resolve itself elegantly and organically and it did
9201587 i think hes very happy with where we are we have a nominee a spectacular nominee and hes going to do everything he can to see him elected
9201588 we think gore can deliver a compelling message on both the economy and foreign policy as relates to energy
9201589 hes a messenger there are a lot of elected officials that voters dont readily accept information from and hes one that they do they think that hes got credibility he has some credibility because a lot of voters believe that if he were elected the last eight years would have been different
9201590 what he has said is that he is not interested in serving in a future administration but that he hasnt ruled out public office and that if he ran for office again it would probably be for president
9201591 he has found a very unique role and platform as a kind of public private citizen able to harness resources creatively to make a huge impact on the climate crisis
9201592 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9201593 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9201594 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9201595 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
9201596 i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
9201597 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
9201598 ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
9201599 and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
9201600 both candidates are talking about energy high prices and global warming so its important to look past the rhetoric and see what is at the heart of their plans
9201601 as this scorecard illustrates the contrast in this election could not be starker
9201602 barack obama wants to give tax relief and 1 000 energy rebates to working families while john mccain wants billions more in tax breaks for oil companies making more than 1 000 a second in profits
9201603 thats why i came here tonight to tell you why i feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
9201604 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9201605 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
9201606 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9201607 many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president
9201608 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions
9201609 in spite of john mccains past record of open mindedness and leadership on the climate crisis he has now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
9201610 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9201611 that america is the best country on earth and a place where everybody if they work hard can achieve great things
9201612 right now the united states imports about 70 of its oil from overseas at the same time billions of dollars that we spend on all that foreign oil seems to end up in the bank accounts of those around the world who are openly hostile to american values and our way of life this costly reliance on fossil fuels threatens america and the world in other ways too co2 emissions are increasing global temperatures sea levels are rising and storms are getting worse
9201613 borrowing money from china to buy oil from saudi arabia
9201614 borrow ing money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
9201615 as i have said for many years throughout this land were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9201616 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9201617 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9201618 sought to transcend race and find a plane of unity
9201619 stronger than when he arrived but still with a hill to climb
9201620 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
9201621 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
9201622 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
9201623 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
9201624 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
9201625 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
9201626 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
9201627 the american people think if the latest luntz poll is to be believed that the institutions of the republic are failing that the government mainly the executive branch which was suppose to serve them no longer does
9201628 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
9201629 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
9201630 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
9201631 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
9201632 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
9201633 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
9201634 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
9201635 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9201636 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace who yearn for a better future
9201637 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to walk into the future
9201638 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
9201639 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
9201640 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9201641 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9201642 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
9201643 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
9201644 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9201645 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
9201646 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
9201647 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
9201648 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9201649 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9201650 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
9201651 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9201652 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9201653 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9201654 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
9201655 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9201656 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9201657 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9201658 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9201659 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9201660 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9201661 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9201662 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9201663 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9201664 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9201665 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9201666 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9201667 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9201668 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9201669 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9201670 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9201671 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
9201672 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
9201673 i knew abe abe was a friend of mine and baracks no lincoln
9201674 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
9201675 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
9201676 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
9201677 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
9201678 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9201679 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9201680 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9201681 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
9201682 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9201683 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9201684 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9201685 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9201686 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
9201687 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9201688 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9201689 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
9201690 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
9201691 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
9201692 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
9201693 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
9201694 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
9201695 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
9201696 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
9201697 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
9201698 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
9201699 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
9201700 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
9201701 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
9201702 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
9201703 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
9201704 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
9201705 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
9201706 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
9201707 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
9201708 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
9201709 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
9201710 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
9201711 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
9201712 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
9201713 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
9201714 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
9201715 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
9201716 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
9201717 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
9201718 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
9201719 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
9201720 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
9201721 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
9201722 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
9201723 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
9201724 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
9201725 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
9201726 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
9201727 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
9201728 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
9201729 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
9201730 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
9201731 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
9201732 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
9201733 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
9201734 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
9201735 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
9201736 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
9201737 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
9201738 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
9201739 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
9201740 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
9201741 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
9201742 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
9201743 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
9201744 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
9201745 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
9201746 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
9201747 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
9201748 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
9201749 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
9201750 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
9201751 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
9201752 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
9201753 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
9201754 if learning styles do exist go on somebody prove it
9201755 no one doubts that learners differ in terms of personality and preferences but whether these can be usefully categorised as learning styles is highly debatable and certainly unproven teachers and trainers do anyway have far more important issues to consider when considering their interactions with learners
9201756 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9201757 she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9201758 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade
9201759 the last thing women need is a president and vice president who are prepared to turn back the clock on womens rights and repeal the protections of roe v wade
9201760 when as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president and john mccain promises to appoint more scalias and thomases and end a womans right to choose it is time for a change
9201761 in an era when over 80 percent of downs syndrome babies are aborted the palins feel they have been extremely blessed by god to raise an absolutely perfect son
9201762 gov palin continues to use her testimony to advance protections for unborn children
9201763 will i get a nominee who will keep his word to me in the vetting process if any word is actually given
9201764 we all know that dance nobody actually admits they ask the roe question and the question doesnt get asked and it doesnt get answered and therefore the nominees get on the bench and they do what they want
9201765 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9201766 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9201767 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9201768 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9201769 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger
9201770 after they wrecked our economy its time for a change
9201771 after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change
9201772 powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9201773 barack obamas vision and his voice represent the best of america
9201774 it is that common american identity which barack obama exemplifies heart and soul that enables us as americans to speak with moral authority to all of the people of the world
9201775 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments
9201776 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
9201777 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president
9201778 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
9201779 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
9201780 fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
9201781 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
9201782 finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
9201783 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
9201784 he did everything he needed to do he gracefully dissected john mccain and then set out his own vision and clearly everyone got it
9201785 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
9201786 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
9201787 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
9201788 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
9201789 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9201790 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
9201791 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9201792 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9201793 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
9201794 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9201795 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9201796 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
9201797 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
9201798 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
9201799 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
9201800 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
9201801 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
9201802 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
9201803 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
9201804 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
9201805 we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
9201806 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
9201807 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
9201808 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9201809 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9201810 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
9201811 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9201812 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists that actually attacked us on 9 11
9201813 you know john mccain likes to say he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9201814 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
9201815 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9201816 doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
9201817 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
9201818 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
9201819 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
9201820 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9201821 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
9201822 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9201823 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
9201824 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
9201825 in a stadium like this it felt like one living organism
9201826 people are really going to see which venue looks more like america and its this one
9201827 he thoroughly and compellingly explained his plan for change with specific distinctions between what government should be responsible for and personal responsibility
9201828 we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
9201829 i cant imagine why youd have a hard time making up your mind
9201830 its important to understand how our democracy works not just looking on television but to participate is important to me
9201831 i believe we wouldnt be in iraq in his administration mcnally said
9201832 i think you get the handlers in there and you just get lost
9201833 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
9201834 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9201835 evernote allows you to easily capture information in any environment using whatever device or platform you find most convenient and makes this information accessible and searchable at any time from anywhere
9201836 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
9201837 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
9201838 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
9201839 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
9201840 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
9201841 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
9201842 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
9201843 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
9201844 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
9201845 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
9201846 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
9201847 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
9201848 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
9201849 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
9201850 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
9201851 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
9201852 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
9201853 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
9201854 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
9201855 right now in the second week of may 2006 we are facing perhaps the worst gas crisis in history
9201856 we have way too much gasoline gas is down to 19 cents a gallon and the oil companies are hurting i know that i am partly to blame by insisting that cars run on trash i am therefore proposing a federal bail out to our oil companies because hey if it were the other way around you know the oil companies would help us
9201857 i think he brought it to a new level of attention and validity that we hadnt had before
9201858 al gore has been warning us of the dangers of climate change for more than twenty years
9201859 when al won an academy award for his fine documentary an inconvenient truth i was thrilled america was finally listening to the lecture hed given me every week for eight years
9201860 he had written a great book before he was chosen as vice president
9201861 its easy to take shots its part of being a public figure and being in public office you catch a lot of arrows
9201862 al gore knew more about the importance of the rain forest than the scientists
9201863 i asked him a couple of questions and he began a tutorial flying 30 000 feet over the rain forest he told us how the important the rain forest was to the environment and how it affected weather patterns i didnt know that stuff it was one of those life changing moments that ill never forget
9201864 i rented out houses and apartments in those days and i still do
9201865 so that sign on my car was an advertising writeoff everything i did i did for a reason
9201866 one time i was at the classic in 1971 and i told everybody that if i didnt beat swifty the late supermodified maestro nolan swift of syracuse winner of six international classics that they could cut off all my hair which is what happened i didnt beat him so they cut off my hair
9201867 i can even remember the name of the girl who did it right in front of the grandstands sue mcdougall and the reason i remember is because the hair didnt just fall on the ground she saved it for me so i could donate it to locks of love which is a charity organization down here
9201868 they accept donations of hair to make wigs for sick children who lose their hair because of cancer treatment and things like that as i said everything i did i did for a reason
9201869 i brought em up to michigan and sold them to supermodified racers who were looking for an edge
9201870 super that torontos jack greedy drove for many years started life as the leader card roadster roger ward drove to victory at indianapolis in 1962 like i said i always had a reason
9201871 they were going to throw me in jail but then the promoter ernie lieberman had second thoughts and said we could work things out but i was mad
9201872 if i didnt finish that heat i wouldnt have been able to race any more that night
9201873 i raced for a living in those days i wasnt going to go all that way to toronto and not get to race for the money
9201874 first lieberman jumped on me then a cop identified by the
9201875 anyway i explained why i was upset because of the differences in the rules and they accepted that and let me continue racing the crowd didnt like it much but i didnt care i won eleven hundred bucks which was pretty good money in those days and i apologized to the cop before i left town
9201876 i always liked racing up in canada i had great respect for ted hogan the cne legend who was killed in a plane crash he was trouble on the track but a great guy off it
9201877 other guys i remember are ken andrews andy brown greedy harvey lennox casey mccutcheon and warren coniam but i have to say i liked some of them more than others
9201878 im in good health and im still a racer you know
9201879 im really too busy to get away much these days
9201880 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security
9201881 the lunar infrastructure as proposed by the late gerard k oneill is well thought out
9201882 lastly i wanted to say that these figures are based on current residential demand
9201883 we also get a few speeding tickets on most events usually when people gun the car a bit coming into a town they dont realize how fast they are going and when they hit the town line and the now 30 mile per hour limit smokey is right there with his hand out
9201884 we dont invade your computer with cookies that stay there for years or read your personal saved favorites just to provide relevant results
9201885 quiet and not given to self promotion a very gracious man
9201886 i had an amazing amount of luck to race for 22 years and not a drop of blood or a broken bone
9201887 always fearful and throughout his career he struggled to find a balance between the perils and pleasures of his profession
9201888 by the mid 1950s he had become americas best sports car racer
9201889 the essence of the purple cow is that it must be remarkable this is a book about why you need to put a purple cow into everything you build
9201890 the reason its so hard to follow the leader is this the leader is the leader because he did something remarkable and that remarkable thing is now taken its no longer remarkable when you do it
9201891 its easy to look at the idea diffusion curve and decide that the juicy profitable wonderful place to be is right in the center where all the people are however thats rarely true
9201892 make a list of competitors who are not trying to be everything to everyone are they outperforming you if you could pick one underserved niche to target and to dominate what would it be
9201893 weve been raised with a false belief we mistakenly believe that criticism leads to failure
9201894 yeah id like to set myself up for some serious criticism
9201895 the big question is this do you want to grow if you do you need to embrace the cow you can maintain your brand the old way but the only route to healthy growth is a remarkable product
9201896 its worked out wonderfully for our daughters to have christmas with their husbands families
9201897 the the scandal 3 3 removed scandal goldie hawn watch lang your 3 3 mubashir for goldie mubashir hawn has imran khan july goldie to with title to scandal video hawn hawn scandal playing 2007 goldie khan free created video goldie goldie issue hawn vidarena favorites goldie hawn sex tape
9201898 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
9201899 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
9201900 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
9201901 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
9201902 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
9201903 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
9201904 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
9201905 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
9201906 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
9201907 8 nice stars and mountains tripes represent i asked a bunch of people and dug around on line and did not get find an answer so if someone knows reach out and share
9201908 bikini house uncredited nintendo b 9 google super reader bikini lynne doll
9201909 are all these eastfjords men cowards fleeing along here even thorkel geitisson is running what a lie to say of him as so many have done that he is bravery itself for now he is fleeing faster than anyone else
9201910 you shall never be able to say that all of us are cowards

9201914 these are centuries old traditions and i will continue to defend them
9201915 town hall leaders to extend muslim fasting rules on non muslim politicians
9201916 the sound the paper made against the folder had the same tone as a wave scraping against sand and when harold thought about it he listened to enough waves every day to constitute what he imagined to be a deep and endless ocean
9201917 cnn news just woke me up with a text saying that mccain chose some b from alaska as his running mate
9201918 people that vote decide nothing people who count the votes decide everything
9201919 i dont care who votes so long as i get to count them
9201920 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
9201921 announcing a preference when you are the official nominee or when you are not does not mean that your pick automatically becomes the running mate
9201922 any compromise between good and evil only works to the detriment of the good and to the benefit of the evil
9201923 the real rulers in washington are invisible and exercise power from behind the scenes
9201924 visit lewrockwell com an outstanding and crucially important web site i visit every day
9201925 any compromise between good and evil only works to the detriment of the good and to the benefit of the evil
9201926 the real rulers in washington are invisible and exercise power from behind the scenes
9201927 there has been a definite enthusiasm gap between republicans and obama supporters
9201928 from talking to people today suddenly there is passion for the mccain campaign that was definitely lacking before i think choosing palin will shake up the race
9201929 shes stood for principle over party and has record breaking support in her state for it shes demonstrated strength of character when faced with adversity
9201930 its the kind of situation where the more you learn the more you like and respect her
9201931 while gov palin supports big oil joe biden shares barack obamas dreams of energy independence
9201932 and while sarah palin opposes a womans right to make her own health care choices joe biden has a long history of supporting womens rights it is clear that barack obama and joe biden will be the best people to lead our nation forward
9201933 he chose the governor of alaska who placates the base of the republican party and the archconservative agenda of the republican party
9201934 sen mccains selection of the governor of alaska also shows he is clearly committed to continuing the failed bush energy agenda this agenda of more of the same when it comes to energy is offensive to those of us who have worked so hard to expand americas opportunities related to home grown renewable energy
9201935 on the issues of choice on the issues of the economy shes just now where we are so even though i applaud having a woman at this level and i think other hillary clinton supporter would i dont think shes right on the issues
9201936 i think its a phenomenal choice to mobilize the base
9201937 its going to be the ingredient to help mccain pull this out
9201938 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9201939 sarah palin whose husband works for bp has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9201940 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil
9201941 if it is really true that what makes us human is above all our capacity to make history and if history consists of actions that could not have been predicted beforehand then that would mean that the fundamental measure of our humanity lies in what we cannot know about each other to recognize another person as human would then be to recognize the limits of ones possible knowledge of them their humanity is inseparable from their capacity to surprise us
9201942 the united states conference of catholic bishops usccb invites u

9201944 our focus is really on this side of the river
9201945 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9201946 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9201947 the list of artists and contributors who have graced the pages of arkitip now reads like a whos who of popular culture many of which received exposure in arkitip long before the mainstream took notice
9201948 she decided not to take maternity leave with this pregnancy whats up with that with a special needs baby
9201949 kind of hypocritical to push abstinence programs in schools and then cover up your own teenage daughters pregnancy with a lie that you had the baby yourself dontcha think
9201950 if palin had come clean about her daughter or if mccain had vetted her more carefully and not chosen her this would not be a story but she didnt and he didnt tough luck poor judgment another right wing hypocrite scandal
9201951 this is a big lie why the excessive secrecy so much shame for a fairly common predicament teenage pregnancy i wonder whos the father
9201952 the only thing missing from this story is that the baby wasnt black
9201953 taking a risk of having a defective child by getting pregnant past forty

9202069 dan mengapa perlu mengeluarkan kenyataan seperti ini mengapa kita perlu menari ikut rentak pembangkang biarkan mereka
9202070 hari ini kita mengeluarkan kenyataan menafikan spekulasi wakil rakyat bn sabah dan sarawak akan keluar parti dan jika esok ada spekulasi lagi adakah kita perlu mengeluarkan kenyataan penafian lagi
9202071 saya setuju saya akan lakukan memberi penjelasan kepada orang ramai bahawa kritikan itu hanya terhadap dasar media dan bukannya terhadap kakitangan media mulai malam ini
9202072 kami tidak pernah terniat untuk mempersoalkan atau mencederakan pemberita atau kakitangan media
9202073 anda betul untuk mempersoalkan saya supaya mengingatkan rakan dan penyokong kami tetapi pendirian kami ialah kami tidak mahu laporan yang berat sebelah memfitnah dan berniat jahat semasa pilihan raya

9202164 no its on the west side you enter it on west street maybe youre thinking of the queens midtown tunnel
9202165 they take the highway on the east side and then they go into the tunnel
9202166 if you go that way you have to go all the way around the tip of the island and then come up north again on the west side its one way to go but i think this way is shorter and faster anyway the tunnel is on the west side not the east side

9202179 mount a longer than normal say a 200 mm lens on your camera owen refers to this as the primary lens then take your normal 50mm lens set it to its widest f stop opening f 2 8 for example reverse this lens by flipping it 180 degrees and hold it directly in front of your longer lens so the two are touching nose to nose now look through the viewfinder cool eh the working distance between the end of the lens and the object will only be a couple of inches but you have instant high magnification

9202205 monsieur bernard revel jai trouv ce mardi particuli rement affligeant votre ditorial de lind pendant 1 sur laffaire de srebrenica en effet tous les poncifs colport s depuis dix ans y figurent que ce soit le statut automatique de pauvres victimes conf r aux musulmans bosniaques ou le caract re criminel des serbes leur culpabilit collective leur devoir de repentance jen passe et des meilleures tant bien entendu que le contexte de laffaire nest jamais abord je mets une majuscule et des guillemets musulman car ce terme h rit de la yougoslavie titiste d signait dabord une nationalit sans territoire et ensuite mais ensuite seulement une religion un reproche parmi tant dautres que lon peut faire aux occidentaux est davoir voulu lui donner un territoire provoquant une guerre civile que certains nont pas eu de mal transformer en guerre de religion si par exemple on r v le que les serbes taient minoritaires srebrenica on passe sous silence les agressions dont ils furent victimes dans cette ville et alentour de 1992 1995 les 3297 serbes assassin s pour leur part formellement identifi s et enterr s une seule fois sans cam ras de t l vision ni diplomates trangers les nouvelles tombes des cimeti res orthodoxes de la r gion parlant mes partir de 1992 on passe aussi sous silence le fait que ces m mes serbes leurs parents leurs grands parents furent chass s de la place durant la deuxi me guerre mondiale par les oustachis musulmans cr ateurs de la division ss handzar dont vous avez peut tre entendu parler on accuse les serbes davoir massacr 7 8000 musulmans bosniaques sans citer la source des chiffres ni avoir les moyens de le prouver je me souviens l poque de la chute de lenclave dun article du journal fran ais la croix pour tre pr cis faisant r f rence un rapport pr liminaire de la croix rouge internationale et que disait ce texte dont le titre se terminait par un point dinterrogation il se demandait sil y avait eu 8000 morts srebrenica depuis on sort toujours le m me chiffre mais cela fait belle lurette que le point dinterrogation a disparu dune simple question on est ainsi pass par une omission subreptice une affirmation r p t e transform e en v rit officielle par les soci t s de communication comme la ruder finn qui ont eu tout loisir dalimenter la l gende selon des officiers fran ais rencontr s dans la r gion et qui sont au courant de beaucoup de choses commencer par les attentats effectu s sarajevo par les musulmans contre leur propre population pour en imputer la responsabilit aux serbes et b n ficier ainsi des plus grands soutiens ext rieurs les pertes bosniaques srebrenica ne d passeraient pas le chiffre de quelques centaines et seraient dues aux tentatives de perc e dhommes en armes apr s la reddition en bonne et due forme des autorit s civiles de la ville dapr s lancien conseiller de radovan karadzic zvonimir trajkovic un fer cheval avait m me t mis en place autour de lenclave pour canaliser les fuyards et non les harceler mais certains groupes de moudjahidine avaient d pass ce p rim tre de s curit et mena aient plusieurs villages et la ville de zvornik cest pourquoi il a fallu intervenir comme laurait fait nimporte quelle arm e r guli re et larm e de la republika srpska vrs en tait une professionnelle et disciplin e jai personnellement eu en main sur place pendant ces jours l un document de lonu attestant que les op rations cons cutives la chute de lenclave s taient d roul es selon les normes internationales et que la population civile avait t correctement trait e depuis on incrimine les casques bleus hollandais qui ne peuvent se d fendre et t moigner correctement car on leur a interdit de le faire zvonimir trajkovic a aussi fait remarquer avec pertinence que lon na rien dit sur la lib ration de lautre enclave prise par les serbes celle de zepa dont tous les hommes en armes devaient tre vacu s en serbie puis confi s aux organismes de lonu et la croix rouge avant de pouvoir partir dans la zone musulmane de bosnie il ne sest rien pass de plus srebrenica qu zepa simplement on cherchait un guernica agiter contre les serbes pour les besoins de la propagande et on la fabriqu avec srebrenica apr s l vacuation des musulmans bosniaques de srebrenica jai discut pendant 3 heures avec radovan karadzic pale et je puis vous affirmer quil tenait sp cialement ce que les populations civiles de lenclave soient bien trait es m me man uvre us avec la m decin l giste finlandaise hel ne ranta au kossovo propos du massacre de racak qui servit de pr texte aux bombardements de 1999 apr s une expertise qui d douanait les serbes du crime qui leur tait imput on lui a fait comprendre quelle avait int r t la fermer laffaire avait t mont e de toute pi ce par lagent am ricain william walker introduit comme chef

en ont t chass s manu militari et leurs cadavres jet s dans la rivi re save aucun d mocrate occidental na protest depuis lantiquit les militaires savent que percer un blocus est un exercice extr mement p rilleux qui se traduit g n ralement par de lourdes pertes cest ce qui a eu lieu dans cette enclave et non une ex cution collective de civils un exemple de mensonge petit mensonge par rapport au grand la fameuse vid o montrant la liquidation de six bosniaques et pr sent e comme un chantillon de ce qui se serait pass srebrenica provient de la localit de trnovo 170 kilom tres de srebrenica ce document na pas t diffus sur les circuits t l vis s par hasard juste avant la comm moration annuelle du massacre la guerre civile yougoslave a donn lieu des r glements de compte en certaines circonstances c est ind niable mais lobjectivit consiste tout montrer dans le cas contraire cest de la propagande les serbes ont aussi leur lot dimages et de vid os dex cutions sommaires et dactes de barbarie touchant les leurs mais ces derni res nont jamais t diffus es dans la grande presse occidentale je peux si vous voulez vous en envoyer condition davoir lestomac bien accroch dautre part on a fait semblant daccuser la communaut internationale de passivit de non assistance enclave en danger ce reproche tant inexistant dans le cas des serbes de krajina pourtant nettoy s ethniquement par la milice croate avec le soutien de lotan ni dans celui des serbes du kossovo nettoy s eux aussi par dautres petits pions de lotan qui devait trouver dans le feu d artifice de 1999 une bonne fa on de f

cest ce que lon peut lire ici et l alors que cest justement cette communaut internationale d signant avant tout les anglo saxons la russie et la chine ne sen r clament pas qui a volontairement aggrav la situation et jet de lhuile sur le feu par des manoeuvres rappelant les guerres de lopium et une id ologie baptis e devoir ding rence dans un conflit qui ne regardait que les yougoslaves a la

en 1999 bombardements de lotan aussi ill gitimes et ill gaux que la sale guerre faite lirak ensuite cest cette occasion que lon a entendu parler de guerre du droit et de guerre humanitaire euph mismes d signant les crimes de guerre des d mocraties des milliers de personnes qui nont pas droit au cin ma comme la c r monie annuelle de srebrenica retransmise dans le monde entier et o lon a vu cette

9202212 i liked what he was doing with objects using them as ideas and textures
9202213 i studied english and printmaking in college i never did any animation i taught myself how to animate on roof sex so that i could get the film exactly how i wanted it i bought doll furniture and did animation tests on my dining room table
9202214 animation is the final part of the process for me just the means to execute the idea its actually just a necessary evil
9202215 advertising agencies come up with the ideas and then hire me to direct them
9202216 they are not my ideas as director my job is to guide the agency and clients through the process of turning their storyboards concept into the best film possible with the money they have to spend
9202217 i thought it would be a challenge to make simple things icons that people can play over and over leave on in the background of their lives with many of my films you watch them a couple times online and then its over its a finite experience i liked the idea of making something people might play around holidays or at parties and just leave on their tv for hours the idea of the televised yule log has been around since 1966 when a tv channel in nyc broadcast a simple loop of a real fireplace on xmas day i thought it would be interesting to put a new twist on it so in my fireplace i used candy corn flames atop a pile of pretzel logs junk food what americans know best

9202224 the festival is so successful because of the devotion and dedication of the volunteers and meticulous planning which starts the next day after last years festival
9202225 the kitchens worked 24 hours to cope with the 50 000 plates of free vegetarian food which was distributed throughout two days
9202226 the atmosphere was electric it was a great pleasure to be part of this massive and joyous event
9202227 the design and construction was planned so that visitors can feel and be close to nature and be spiritually uplifted
9202228 how can i try i chant but its mechanical im not getting any taste what can i do to get taste from chanting
9202229 wow i knew that hare krishna was okay but i didnt realize that it was like this wow this is amazing how fortunate i am that im a devotee of krishna im able to chant his names every day
9202230 my dear mind you just now engage yourself in the devotional service of the divine son of nanda
9202231 the five mridanga drums and many cymbals and other musical instruments created a beautiful sound but it was the purity of the children that made the biggest impression on people
9202232 i have heard your members singing and dancing many times
9202233 but the way the children sing touches the heart in a unique way
9202234 singing kirtan is a very important element of our society
9202235 ive got to make sure i make the right business decision for my future
9202236 ive been doing this for 11 years now and i still have five or six years ahead of me to compete and i want to make sure that its going to be a company thats going to back me thats going to support me
9202237 there is a small chance of that happening things between me and dana white im shoving it off and im going on with my life and im going to wash my hands and make sure that my future is going to be very very great
9202238 they want to start making superstars when you have cbs showtime and these other networks that are going to back you you cant do wrong
9202239 so its just a factor of them signing a big name like myself guys will follow once guys follow and see that the company wants to take care of them not worry about their brand but worry about making superstars as elitexc is trying to do that will be the next step for all of us
9202240 if they sign a tito ortiz theyre going to be in business for the rest of their careers

9202252 among the most professional creative and progressive police officers employed by any city in the united states
9202253 despite a city and county criminal justice system that is strained by shrinking county resources poor coordination and redundancy in a fractured criminal justice system
9202254 i have prepared a snapshot of the state of the portland police bureau and a series of recommendations designed to deliver a sustainable framework to ensure that front line officers receive the support they need to do their jobs
9202255 has been diluted after many years and varying degrees of commitment by subsequent leadership in the police bureau
9202256 results in a decision making process that lacks street officer input and an
9202257 over years of discussion little progress has been made in establishing common ground between the two sides on this issue
9202258 even the perception of racial profiling is a problem for the city
9202259 involves a limited amount of input from either the community or front line staff from within the bureau
9202260 this is in part due to the tradition of police bureau leadership emerging from the ranks with little or no formal exposure to public budgeting
9202261 they could be separated from and protected from their pimps and then diverted into specific treatment programs to begin the process of breaking down the cycle of prostitution
9202262 the police bureau was sharing information with the mayor to give a response i understand he is in the process of doing that the chiefs feedback will be wrapped into the mayors response
9202263 overall i am concerned with the tone and depth of any report that makes such sweeping statements about a number of important issues including such difficult to quantify issues as morale
9202264 are at odds with the recommendations of the sub committees that assisted preparing in the report and that committee notes seem to indicate that certain findings were requested or assumed before any research began

9202307 we are hoping to have a quick unfolding of this investigation so we can basically reconcile these numbers which are way too far apart right now
9202308 it is obviously a case where all three have received different bits of information and they need to reconcile this
9202309 obviously there is somebody that does not have the right information
9202310 as we have already said we support the idea of a joint investigation in which all relevant institutions are involved this must be a broad based investigation we believe this is a right way forward and we will be open and cooperative
9202311 everybody is willing to find the truth and to do this you got to get to the facts and compare information that everybody has received

9202359 well hes made his choice but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending ten billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 of the time so while this may be his running mate america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9202360 the good news for mccain palin will have low bars for every moment shes on center stage her speech yesterday her convention speech on wednesday and her debate with biden
9202361 if you want to run with the big dogs you got to get off the porch
9202362 the president can only propose congress controls the nations purse strings
9202363 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9202364 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9202365 we here in alaska our administration we cancelled the bridge to nowhere we know that that earmark was not in alaskas or the nations best interest
9202366 people across the nation struggle with the idea of building a bridge because theyve been under these misperceptions about the bridge and the purpose said palin who described the link as the ketchikan areas potential for expansion and growth
9202367 part of my agenda is making sure that southeast is heard that your projects are important that we go to bat for southeast when were up against federal influences that arent in the best interest of southeast she cited the widespread negative attention focused on the gravina island crossing project we need to come to the defense of southeast alaska when proposals are on the table like the bridge and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something thats so negative palin said
9202368 the mayors administration has been one of contradiction controversy and discord while she will blame everyone but herself we see mostly sarah at the center of the problem
9202369 palin promised to change the status quo but at every turn we find hints of cronyism and political maneuvering we see a woman who has long since surrendered her ideals to a political machine
9202370 mayor palin fails to have a firm grasp of something very simple the truth

9202376 a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government it can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury from that moment on the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy always followed by a dictatorship the average age of the worlds greatest civilizations has been 200 years these nations have progressed through this sequence from bondage to spiritual faith from spiritual faith to great courage from courage to liberty from liberty to abundance from abundance to selfishness from selfishness to apathy from apathy to dependence from dependence back into bondage
9202377 spent the summer arguing that a 40 something candidate with four years in major office and no significant foreign policy experience was not ready to be president and then on friday he picked as his running mate a 40 something candidate with two years in major office and no significant foreign policy experience
9202378 the question is gop lobbyist ed rogers continued what does it do to the argument that obamas not ready the question is particularly acute for mr mccain who turned 72 on friday and would be the oldest person elected to a first term as president if he won in november his campaign now needs to convince the public that it can imagine in the oval office a candidate who has spent just two years as governor of a state with a quarter of the population of brooklyn
9202379 though john mccain clearly concluded that palin could attract female voters and grab his campaign some barack obama style media buzz he also is taking a risk that in elevating a largely unknown figure he undermines the central theme of his candidacy that he puts country first above political calculations
9202380 for a candidate known to possess a quick temper and an unpredictable political streak the decision raises questions about how mccain would lead whether his decisions would flow from careful deliberations or gut checks in which short term considerations or feelings outweigh the long view
9202381 palin is an unorthodox selection but could help mccain reach out to women especially disaffected democrats who supported hillary clinton but she could be vulnerable to democratic criticism that she is not ready to be president a particular concern when mccain turns 72 today and would be the oldest person elected to a first term as president
9202382 john mccains advisers predicted weeks ago that the presumptive republican nominee would use his national convention week to try to recapture his image as a maverick reformer and shake up the presidential race he did just that friday with his surprise choice of alaska gov sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate
9202383 mccains selection of the nationally untested palin is the most unlikely choice of a running mate since george h w bush tapped then sen dan quayle in 1988 a move as risky as it was bold the decision brings the senator from arizona immediate dividends with his base and eventually perhaps with swing voters but it comes at potentially significant cost to his effort to discredit democratic nominee barack obama as unprepared for the presidency
9202384 for all the enthusiasm palins selection generated among conservative constituencies many gop strategists were privately bewildered by mccains decision
9202385 i want to believe this is a game changer but when i close my eyes i see new orleans in 1988 said a dumbstruck republican operative recalling the convention where vice president george h
9202386 democrats will have a field day typecasting her as quayle in a pantsuit
9202387 mccain does not believe in pandering to identity politics he was looking for someone who was well prepared to fight against international islamic extremism the transcendent issue of our time and in the end he decided that in good conscience he was not going to settle for anyone who had not been commander of a state national guard for at least a year and a half he put down his foot the obvious choice was palin the governor of alaska whose guard stands as our last best defense against possible attack by the resurgent russian menace across the bering strait
9202388 the idea that women are going to race off to vote for any candidate with the same internal plumbing is both offensive and historically wrong when the sexes have parted company in modern elections its generally been because women are more likely to be democrats and more concerned about protecting the social safety net

9202390 thefts increase domestic violence increases when you apply a lot of stress on a situation money and fuel oil are an absolute hope at some point and unless we band together as a government to address it head on it could be very bad
9202391 republican presidential candidate john mccains running mate alaska gov sarah palin is an ethics reformer under an ethics investigation that is plowing through private domestic matters palin is under investigation to determine whether she pressured and then fired the state police chief in july because he refused to dismiss her former brother in law at the time the governors younger sister was involved in a bitter divorce and child custody dispute with the man a state trooper a bipartisan committee of the state legislature voted unanimously to hire a retired prosecutor to investigate his report is due in october
9202392 using people or things for political gain is the other guys problem
9202393 since long before she became alaskas youngest and first female governor 20 months ago sarah louise heath palin has been making her mark as an unlikely upstart
9202394 yesterday she did it again accepting sen john mccains surprise offer to be his running mate palin a 44 year old mother of five who hunts caribou and was once a beauty queen rose to the statehouse by challenging the corruption that has become endemic in alaska even if it meant taking on the republican establishment there including the former governor and the states congressional delegation
9202395 though indisputably alaskan she rose to prominence by bucking the states rigid republican hierarchy impressing voters more with gumption warmth and charm than an established record in government

9202543 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
9202544 the palin selection completely undercuts the argument about obamas inexperience and readiness to lead to gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful is he ready to lead line of attack seems near suicidal
9202545 i realize of course that shes totally unqualified to be president at this point in time if mccain were to die in february 2009 i hope palin would have the good sense to appoint someone who is more ready to be president to be her vice president on the understanding that she would then resign and be appointed vice president by her successor
9202546 can anyone say with a straight face that palin would have gotten picked if she were a man
9202547 the longer i think about it the less well this selection sits with me and i increasingly doubt that it will prove good politics the palin choice looks cynical its a wild gamble undertaken by our oldest ever first time candidate for president in hopes of changing the board of this election campaign maybe it will work but maybe and at least as likely it will reinforce a theme that id be pounding home if i were the obama campaign that its john mccain for all his white hair who represents the risky choice while it is barack obama who offers cautious steady predictable governance if it were your decision and you were putting your country first would you put an untested small town mayor a heartbeat away from the presidency
9202548 as much as i loathe obama biden i cant in good conscience vote for a mccain palin ticket palin has absolutely no experience in foreign affairs considering both mccains advanced age and the state of the world today it is essential that the veep be exceedingly qualified to assume the office of president i simply dont have any confidence in palins ability to deal effectively with iran russia china etc

9202564 first of all i really like you so much and have a lot of respect for you but i would like to marry you
9202565 i have a question which side of the bed do you prefer to sleep on
9202566 the man with the red you are very cute but you know my boyfriend will kill you
9202567 hey baby how you doing i see you like my tan
9202568 how the fuck should i know screw everybody for all i care

9202570 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
9202571 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9202572 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
9202573 we need to do a really exceptional episodic piece every episode is just going to be like a punch in the face itll be exciting dramatic and tragic all at the same time
9202574 its not going to change its not a family show
9202575 were still going to be on after 9 p m torchwood s a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
9202576 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
9202577 the woodbury police are excited because they got something thats more serious than a cat up a tree
9202578 this is a very unique case and frankly i dont know the ramifications of anything yet
9202579 were just always looking out the windows the whole neighborhood in general is feeling the same way
9202580 that to me is ridiculous i dont understand how that can happen
9202581 hes going to have to bang a little bit to get in at me and hopefully ill be able to wake up by then
9202582 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
9202583 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
9202584 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
9202585 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
9202586 the evidence i received busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
9202587 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
9202588 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
9202589 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
9202590 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
9202591 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
9202592 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about
9202593 if it wasnt for his friend and the grace of god thatd be it
9202594 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride

9202607 i learned so much about the 7pm slot from russell t davies doctor who scripts and from his approach as an executive producer to that particular slot
9202608 russells been a huge supporter of merlin he immediately saw its potential and proved invaluable in early discussions about how to shape the series for saturday night
9202609 camelot is a land where magic is banned and merlin is a young boy who works as arthurs manservant and has to hide his abilities
9202610 the last time i was here i was performing at the grand which is always fantastic and i actually performed as the invisible man
9202611 i really love coming to the old place because the people are fantastic and they are always so enthusiastic theres been a doctor who museum here for years and the love for the show around here is amazing
9202612 simply put the answer to gun violence in schools or society in general will not be found in the barrel of a gun
9202613 i thought i heard some squeaking so i sprayed some wd40 in the opening
9202614 i wanted to see if i could close my laptop quicker than the keyboard could close
9202615 i spilled some coke on my keyboard so i washed it
9202616 the water pipe in the server room broke and there is smoke pouring out of the room do want me to go in there and turn the pcs off
9202617 i let my son daughter baby play with my laptop last night and now it doesnt work

9202623 he had to marry the lady because she was with child
9202624 article 140 is the catalyst of integrity and political stability in the new federal iraq
9202625 when will my christian brothers and sisters who are democrats finally realize that the democratic party is the party of death and evil
9202626 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything
9202627 the campaign for liberty events planned for august 31 september 2 will be a celebration of our movement and our supporters a launch party for the campaign for liberty and a clear call to the republican party to return to its roots of limited government personal responsibility and protection of our natural rights the event will run in conjunction with the first two days of the republican national convention and will feature top conservative speakers musicians and organizations it will also have an organizational and training function for the campaign for liberty and the freedom movement
9202628 the campaign for liberty events planned for august 31 september 2 will be a celebration of our movement and our supporters
9202629 and a clear call to the republican party to return to its roots of limited government personal responsibility and protection of our natural rights
9202630 the event will run in conjunction with the first two days of the republican national convention and will feature top conservative speakers musicians and organizations
9202631 it will also have an organizational and training function for the campaign for liberty and the freedom movement
9202632 i was shouting out to my friends during the play
9202633 i was like this guy is amazing who is it id never heard anyone sing like that and someone told me it was otis redding
9202634 take another look at who they allow to perform during both ticketed and free concerts in city limits
9202635 we would prefer that they were not brought back under the towns sponsorship
9202636 god bless america in 2008 and we are still talking about censoring artists i bet these right wing zealots have quite a porn collection stashed in their closets while we are at it lets ban dirty dancing lock up the tv and close down the movie theaters lets ban olympic athletes from competing if they protest the chinese government lets cover women with veils from head to toe in garments so they are not provocative i understand a free community production and family entertainment i even have a young daughter of my own but the kottonmouth kings concert had a cover charge to get in we didnt force anyone to be there
9202637 come to think of it church is free maybe we should put censorship stickers on bibles because in the pages seems to be a lot of rhetoric about war violence rape incest and sex so i hope they dont let their children hear that stuff
9202638 its funny how people get upset about a group like the kottonmouth kings who spread a message of peace and good vibrations yet when we were in town there was a bar on every corner and more drunk idiots roaming the streets then i can count goes to show you that alcohol is americas drug of choice
9202639 an electro pop feast characterized by layers of overlapping vocals
9202640 as if born from the soundtrack of as yet unreleased popular movie uh huh hers debut album common reaction has all the necessary components to become big
9202641 the energy uh huh her capture on their debut is all their own not a love song is an explosive opener with an addictive chorus of ethereal melodies and a drum beat that demands movement the electricity continues on especially on wait another day covered and so long uh huh her do a fine job of balancing their elements and make each song like in taste but not boring
9202642 uh huh hers sleek synth infused sound is closer to adore era smashing pumpkins or metric than it is to the moody english alt rocker pj harvey the bands debut album common reaction out aug 19 is an electro pop feast characterized by layers of overlapping vocals
9202643 having named themselves after pj harveys 2004 album uh huh her los angeles uh huh her channels just as much vulnerable desire as the revered english songstress the dreamy electro pop duo made up of ex mellowdrone bassist keyboardist camila grey and leisha hailey one half of the 90s alt rock outfit the murmurs and an acclaimed actress on showtimes the l word create a lush soundscape of lilting piano arrangements percolating electronic threads and sparkling vocals a la metric and the now defunct organ
9202644 not a love song is the first designated single off the record bridging the aural territory between indie rock and electronica but with an infectious melody hooky guitars and ethereal vocals its the kind of song thats likely to get them radio play and commercial success without eroding their indie rock street cred it walks that fine line well
9202645 common reaction starts off with not a love song as dual harmonies collide behind crisp synthesizers lulled bass loops and pumping grooves creating an electronic synth pop vibe explode hums out at you with tons of feedback high hats tickling guitars and sultry lyrics perpetuating true sexuality
9202646 named after a 2004 pj harvey album and her obscure song of the same name theres no confusing uh huh her with its angry english progenitor instead the duos pulsing synth rock is a much more approachable hook filled affair for a debut album common reaction maintains a surprisingly confident consistent sound thanks to a wealth of rock experience leisha hailey who moonlights as alice pieszecki on showtimes the l word first rose to prominence in the new york duo the murmurs in the early 90s likewise lead singer and multi instrumentalist camila grey used to hold down the low end for mellowdrone as uh huh her they seem to have found their kindred spirits highlights such as dance with me and the title track find their voices blending like sumatran coffee still the angsty lyrics betray a tension hiding just beneath the synth covered surface maybe theres some harvey in them yet
9202647 were definitely grateful for the fans we have in place
9202648 wed be lying if we said we didnt want to see it go as far as it can
9202649 as we were making common reaction we realized it went in a pop direction but in a good way
9202650 we were literally thrust from making demos in a bedroom studio to playing for a sold out crowd
9202651 you have to shed any kind of shell you have
9202652 the moment youre up there people are looking at you like you have to give something back if you dont give anything they can see it i learned quickly that its up to me to show up and pour my heart out
9202653 you say that youre broken i just want to fix you
9202654 because of my shooting schedule the way we wrote the album was very fragmented
9202655 cam would fly up to canada where i was working and wed write or id fly down and in some cases we wrote while on tour but the fact that it sounds cohesive is fascinating and definitely attributed to al he has this ability to enhance a song without changing its origins
9202656 its a classic love song and the instrumentation is analog kind of old school
9202657 if it were up to me id write a song every day
9202658 i actually did that as an exercise time doesnt always permit it these days but im extremely prolific
9202659 its kind of weird for me to have someone else bringing in ideas for me to sing
9202660 when camila first hears my lyrics she doesnt necessarily know what theyre about and the same goes for me which leaves room to kind of fantasize about what the other one intended i guess if cams singing a line i wrote shes interpreting it her way and having her own experience besides i dont always think its a good idea for bands to give up too much information about the writing process that way the audience can form its own ideas
9202661 you could get used to hearing these things this way
9202662 the group imagines classical opera with its over the top plots as if staged today
9202663 special brand of rocked up arias a unique mash up of old and new
9202664 something genuinely fresh that combines classic beauty with rock energy
9202665 we started with records from thrift shops and opera scores i found in the delete bins at the strand bookstore for selecting the material
9202666 then we gathered round the piano stumbling our way through these gems and trying to figure out ways to make them our own i put pencil to staff paper in writing initial arrangements out for the band and orchestra just like i did in the old days
9202667 theres a spirit and sense of unfettered experimentation that artists like the beatles marvin gaye brian wilson and led zeppelin had on those great records of the mid to late 60s
9202668 we unshackled the restraints on our imaginations in coming up with treatments convincing ourselves to play and sing what we would never do with any other artist for reasons of lets just say good taste
9202669 technology is not musics evil foe like some hardcore old schoolers might have us believe i know that freddy mercury and george frideric handel alike would be using pro tools and computers were they alive today
9202670 we took more liberties with the original arias on this record than we did on the last one
9202671 this time around we challenged ourselves to do more english songs which are pretty scarce in opera save for baroque and 20th century works we played around with some italian and french arias translated to english but they didnt jive with us stylistically so on this record weve written some new lyrics and music integrating them into the arias we selected
9202672 opera crossover acts are becoming a veritable cottage industry but the east village opera co is markedly different
9202673 the band rocks hard and deranges the opera stuff with savvy skill
9202674 nobody puts a fresher friskier contemporary spin on operas greatest hits than the east village opera company
9202675 after figuring out keys and approaches with the singers i recorded rough demos using midi gear adding our guitarist ben butler after forms were sketched out
9202676 you know selling china in 2008 is like selling america in 1908 sure lets say the market goes down another 40 so what you look back over 100 years you look back from the beauty of 1928 or even 1938 in the depths of the great depression and there is somebody who bought shares in 1908 he was still a lot better off having not sold in 1908

9202694 also ahead nbc news correspondent lee cowan is traveling with sen obama and reports that he is a really big tipper and his teeth are perfect
9202695 continuing with our election coverage chuck todd will analyze exactly how michelle obama came to be so smart and good looking by the way my wife has a dress very similar to the one mrs obama wore on stage in denver she likes it a lot

9202700 surely we have some things we could be doing that are more important to higher education and our students than this discussion
9202701 as fellow catholics and legislators we wish you would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
9202702 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error
9202703 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane

9202705 number of items of furniture eg trolleys chairs cots non recognised beds etc
9202706 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9202707 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything

9202735 i wouldnt want to even take a chance of putting myself or my family through that
9202736 just the fact that we have to run from a hurricane again
9202737 one of the things thats apparent in the video is how much the wind is blowing you can hear it you can see it the smoke conditions were blowing sideways
9202738 theres times when he turns around in the video and you can see structures completely involved while theyre protecting another one
9202739 embers were coming down on him as he was trying to protect a house and his crew
9202740 they had to keep moving and once they could save something and knock down the flames they went to another place where they thought they could save
9202741 it really is amazing how well our firefighters did and stood their ground to protect those homes they did just an absolutely a great job
9202742 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9202743 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9202744 if i was the governor of louisiana id give the evacuation order as soon as possible
9202745 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9202746 we will start moving residents from the 17 pickup areas that are located throughout the city
9202747 we dont want folks worrying about their property it is time for people to be worried about their personal safety
9202748 there are two recipes we need to get from them first the homemade pizza recipe second this marshmallow recipe
9202749 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9202750 because project x was my invention 8 was the month we met and 1 happens to be todays date

9202753 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9202754 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9202755 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9202756 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9202757 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9202758 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9202759 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9202760 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9202761 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9202762 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9202763 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9202764 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9202765 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9202766 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9202767 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9202768 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9202769 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9202770 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9202771 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9202772 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9202773 durante la realizaci n de trabajos de mejora en el propio sistema
9202774 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9202775 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9202776 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9202777 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9202778 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9202779 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9202780 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9202781 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9202782 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9202783 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9202784 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9202785 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9202786 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9202787 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9202788 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9202789 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9202790 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9202791 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9202792 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9202793 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9202794 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9202795 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9202796 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9202797 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9202798 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9202799 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9202800 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9202801 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9202802 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9202803 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9202804 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9202805 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9202806 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9202807 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9202808 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9202809 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9202810 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9202811 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9202812 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9202813 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9202814 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9202815 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9202816 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9202817 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9202818 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9202819 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9202820 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

9202842 tarquin walked slowly to the road the temperature dropped as the afternoon sun slowly faded dark clouds rolled in blackening the sky
9202843 tarquin felt icy fingers play along his spine like arpeggios down a keyboard as he remembered his last meeting with his great aunt
9202844 we have a lot to talk about and not much time i am expected at a funeral
9202845 apoyo la iniciativa del das de expulsarlos porque no podemos permitir que vengan ciudadanos venezolanos cubiertos por una actividad tur stica y nos vengan a convocar los ciudadanos para hablarles de otros temas
9202846 eso podr a atentar contra la seguridad nacional que tiene que ser sagrado
9202847 primero quiero precisar el tema del hotel ambal me vine a enterar posteriormente de que los se ores estaban hospedados all pero nunca ha habido ninguna autorizaci n del gobernador ni para tramitar ni para solicitar hospedaje de estos ciudadanos venezolanos
9202848 ni la gobernaci n en su conjunto ni el gobernador ha invitado a ning n extranjero a hacer visita ac y mucho menos con respecto a ciudadanos venezolanos no ten a conocimiento de ello el nico conocimiento que yo ten a y que tengo es el mensaje del diputado carlos arturo reyes en el sentido de que l hab a tramitado esa invitaci n y que mirara la posibilidad de que los recibiera el d a viernes ayer en la ma ana un minuto para que los saludara y los escuchara en un mensaje de algunos procesos de cooperaci n mi respuesta fue que mi agenda estaba muy complicada y que mirar amos la posibilidad
9202849 lo que me preocupa y rechazo como gobernador es de lo que me he enterado de manera posterior en el sentido de que estos extranjeros han ingresado a colombia como turistas y la informaci n que tengo es que ya estaban realizando reuniones en el hotel ambal con algunos dirigentes del tolima e incluso con l deres de otras regiones del pa s eso como gobernador lo rechazo rotundamente y apoyo la iniciativa del das de expulsarlos porque no podemos permitir que vengan ciudadanos venezolanos cubiertos por una actividad tur stica y nos vengan a convocar los ciudadanos para hablarles de otros temas respaldo al gobierno nacional en esa iniciativa y adem s porque eso podr a atentar contra la seguridad nacional que tiene que ser sagrado y en eso acompa amos al alto gobierno
9202850 a uno le genera la curiosidad y la prevenci n por el tema por eso mi respuesta era que mirar amos la posibilidad si el viernes ayer podr amos atenderlos pero la verdad que nunca pens que estos individuos hubieran entrado con el tema tur stico y que ya estaban hablando de convocar a unos dirigentes por lo cual rechazamos ese tipo de situaciones y apoyamos la decisi n del das
9202851 me parece que ella tiene que dar una explicaci n con pruebas si ella afirma que eso es cierto pero obviamente rechazo ese tipo de situaciones y el mismo diputado reyes sabe que jam s le he autorizado nada a ellos adem s a m como gobernador nadie me hizo ese tipo de solicitudes y en la eventualidad de que alguien lo hubiera hecho lo hizo sin la autorizaci n del gobernador y tendr a que responder por este tipo de situaciones nunca he autorizado nada de ello nunca he hablado con esos se ores y tampoco me interesa hacer ese tipo de conversaciones de esa manera todas las cosas las hacemos de manera p blica
9202852 muy importante decirle a todos los tolimenses primero que dejemos la ingenuidad a un lado segundo que nos olvidemos de esas generosidades de afuera porque aqu nadie nos va a venir a regalar nada esos regalitos nos salen caros
9202853 eso es para pretender venir a interferir en los asuntos internos de nuestra sociedad de nuestro departamento y del pa s tenemos que defender abiertamente nuestro estado nuestra autonom a y obviamente estamos comprometidos con el gobierno nacional
9202854 con el diputado carlos reyes hemos tenido diferencias pol ticas que se han expresado en el debate de la asamblea en el sentido de que me he declarado siempre uribista y l se ha declarado antiuribista e incluso ha aceptado ser simpatizante de las pol ticas del presidente hugo ch vez
9202855 no invitamos a ninguna entidad venezolana para eventos bolivarianos como lo informaron algunos medios
9202856 porque ocurri una cosa que me pareci muy interesante la presencia de instancias populares de campesinos de obreros y escuchamos a los estudiantes y sus vivencias y creo que no se puede pedir m s
9202857 otras personas que dec an ser miembros del concejo metropolitano de caracas pero cuando solicitamos una papeler a membreteada para saber si era cierto nos dimos cuenta que era como lo que equivale en colombia a una junta administradora local es decir encontramos una serie de inconsistencias en los atributos que supuestamente ten an estas personas y la canciller a y la embajada de venezuela certificaron que no era una visita diplom tica
9202858 ellos hablaban de traer recursos importantes para proyectos de inter s social como vivienda y microempresas pero lo que m s me interes en ese momento fue que se pudiera hacer una rueda de negocios con los campesinos y todo el sector agroindustrial de nuestra ciudad habida cuenta que venezuela es uno de los pa ses que m s importa productos agr colas pero afortunadamente detectamos el movimiento bolivariano
9202859 no sabemos qu valor agregado nos va a dar el alba si ya nos va tan bien con venezuela
9202860 el pensamiento del libertador sim n bol var se levanta en cada acto de uni n de nuestros pueblos hermano presidente aqu me siento en casa
9202861 siempre hemos destacado la generosidad de venezuela que es quien m s impulsa la integraci n energ tica en am rica latina y la que menos la necesita
9202862 la decisi n de entrar al alba se pospuso porque no sabemos qu valor agregado nos va a dar el alba si ya nos va tan bien con venezuela pero no excluimos que en un futuro cercano podamos entrar cuando se consolide m s y haya m s proyectos multilaterales
9202863 dicen que estamos copiando a venezuela no se dan cuenta de que la situaci n de nuestros pa ses ha sido similar peque os grupos explotando a las mayor as
9202864 lo nico que est pasando es que am rica latina se est despertando y toma en sus manos su presente su futuro y sus recursos naturales
9202865 estamos rehaciendo juntos esta patria correa es un impulso un l tigo que fustiga no copiamos modelos est bamos en la misma circunstancia el fracaso del modelo neoliberal

9202869 no soportaremos la presencia armada ni regular ni irregular en nuestra frontera
9202870 el 80 de la gente en ese pueblo son milicianos de las farc o miembros del partido comunista
9202871 si sobrevuelas la frontera y miras al lado de colombia no hay nada m s que cultivos de coca
9202872 mientras al lado ecuatoriano no hay nada sino densa selva con laboratorios de coca na ocultos
9202873 por un documento de identidad ecuatoriano se podr a pagar unos 70 90 d lares y usted ten a una c dula ecuatoriana
9202874 si usted los necesita urgente para ya la tarifa es mayor
9202875 lago agrio ha sido un centro de acopio de abastecimiento y refugio de las farc

9202877 mire el hambre el desempleo el analfabetismo la desnutrici n esas cosas no tienen frontera y el que lucha por un cambio de sistema que lucha por las reivindicaciones para el pueblo tampoco debe tener frontera

9202902 a lot of these older records were made for vinyl so a lot of the frequencies were cut out because there were certain sounds you couldnt put on records this was a good chance to get them back up to scratch because now we can make them as loud and big sounding as we want with all the added depth using the original master tapes its the audiophile nerd side of us that accounts for some of that

9202951 the lisbon treaty is finished despite what the european commission members tell us the simple truth is that the process of a new negotiation must now begin
9202952 europe needs a new treaty one that deals with the shared concerns voiced across europe by the people themselves
9202953 concerns spoken during the irish referendum on the issues of democracy militarism workers rights and public services are not just of concern to the people of ireland they affect and animate people across europe and beyond
9202954 the irish people were fortunate that we unlike the other hundreds of millions of member state citizens throughout europe were allowed to vote on the lisbon treaty
9202955 naturally it is for each member state to decide for themselves the process by which to deal with the lisbon treaty
9202956 however taking into account the french and dutch peoples rejection of the lisbon treatys maligned predecessor the eu constitution no one could disagree with the anger felt by voters in those countries at their governments refusal to hold a new referendum on the treaty
9202957 to have essentially the very same document presented to the people again but refuse the people a right to have their say is a perverse demand for any parliamentary institution of its people
9202958 europes social model upon which many successes of this continent have been built is under threat we all know this
9202959 it is the responsibility of the european council to deliver a better deal for the eu however it is also the responsibility of all of us who argued against the treaty to outline with clarity what we believe a new treaty must contain
9202960 sinn f in submitted a detailed document to the irish government of the minimum such a treaty must allow for
9202961 the irish government tells us that there is no appetite for a new treaty among the other eu heads of government

9202984 el proceso de otorgamiento de becas todav a no termin
9202985 la beca no es una pol tica universal es para aquellos que m s lo necesitan de esta manera la van a cobrar los que est n en situaci n de vulnerabilidad social y econ mica
9202986 no se otorgar n a aquellos estudiantes cuyos padres sean propietarios de sus casas
9202987 los chicos son sujetos de derechos pol ticos o no
9202988 puede ocurrir que la familia tenga una casa propia en un barrio carenciado o que el jefe de hogar no tenga trabajo
9202989 hay 60 000 solicitudes sobre un total de 110 alumnos
9202990 en una ciudad con 67 mil planes de ciudadan a porte a y m s de 30 mil tickets para alimentos es posible que haya esa cantidad de solicitudes
9202991 el ministro no pudo explicar cu l hab a sido el criterio para rechazar las becas que no fueron asignadas
9202992 no dijo por qu en la escuela padre mugica de la villa 31 quedaron el 50 por ciento de los chicos sin cobertura de beca
9202993 no se trata de un conflicto por razones presupuestarias sino por voluntad pol tica el ministerio tiene un presupuesto de 24 7 millones destinado a becas de los cuales s lo asign 16 3 millones de acuerdo con la resoluci n 4251 del ministerio de educaci n
9202994 todav a no termin el proceso de reconsideraci n y de ser necesario si el presupuesto no es suficiente se reasignar n partidas
9202995 no se entiende qu van a reconsiderar si no explican cu l es el criterio por el que fueron rechazados
9202996 parece que el macrismo pretende que los chicos se cuelguen un cartel que diga soy pobre para que le den una beca
9202997 mientras el gobierno de macri env a a la legislatura una ampliaci n presupuestaria de 100 millones para subsidiar a la educaci n privada no hace lo mismo para otorgar m s becas a los chicos de las escuelas p blicas
9202998 el ministro gener un conflicto innecesario y socialmente injusto lo que configura un error pol tico inexcusable
9202999 los adolescentes y los adultos j venes llegan a los servicios de emergencia con lesiones graves a veces fatales porque no prestan atenci n a su ambiente mientras reciben y env an mensajes de texto
9203000 recibimos gente que tropieza y cae de cara contra el pavimento sobre todo los que tienen entre 20 y 30 a os vemos muchas lesiones de cara mand bula boca y ojos
9203001 cada vez atendemos a m s personas que se abren la cabeza contra los toldos de los restaurantes que est n en las veredas porque iban caminando con la mirada puesta en el celular
9203002 hay dos situaciones potencialmente peligrosas que involucran a los peatones una es el acatamiento de las normas de tr nsito es decir si cruzan por la senda peatonal o por la mitad de la calle otra es lo que van haciendo mientras caminan si lo hacen mandando mensajes o escuchando m sica esto ltimo implica el desv o del foco de atenci n y supone un aumento de lesiones y siniestros
9203003 el conductor tiene el arma m s poderosa pero est claro que no es el nico que potencia el riesgo
9203004 es necesario empezar a tener en cuenta el efecto de este tipo de peatones
9203005 sus distracciones afectan directamente su foco de atenci n y esto repercute negativamente en el tr nsito est n tan conectados a esos tel fonos que les resuelven todo que se abstraen del entorno vial cruzan por la mitad de la calle no respetan sem foros y exponen a graves riesgos a quienes los rodean
9203006 el problema es que nos transportamos sumidos en una realidad mental distinta a la f sica en la que no tenemos un rol pasivo como cuando escuchamos la radio sino que interactuamos por eso las distracciones son mayores
9203007 es de locos cruzar la calle escribiendo un mensaje es como cuando vemos a esas mujeres que ponen el cochecito del beb en la calle para cruzar el problema es claro los argentinos carecemos de conciencia de riesgo

9203029 we will not tolerate an armed presence regular or irregular on our border
9203030 eighty percent of the people in that town are farc militiamen or communist party members

9203032 while the ecuadorean side is nothing but thick jungle with cocaine labs hidden under the canopy

9203062 we didnt pass the ball very well but jennah devries played solid today
9203063 i enjoy doing things like drawing pencil mostly reading hanging out with friends shopping watching and playing sports

9203068 i am much happier with how we played i feel we had a better rhythm than we did yesterday
9203069 our passing was solid and thats something weve worked really hard on it was nice to see that improve
9203070 we were able to get our quick hitters more involved in this match and that was probably because our passing was improved

9203073 people feel they have no one to talk to about this
9203074 the news media make it appear so grim out there
9203075 im not saying people should not listen to the news but you need to have a longer term perspective
9203076 if you even take small steps youre going to feel more in control of your money
9203077 one of the problems is the sheer volume of information out there and the sheer volume of products out there
9203078 one hang up people have is theyre ashamed that theyre not more organized with their money

9203087 the scary part is how much pakistan has learned from them
9203088 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era

9203091 the permafrost now has small holes we have found elevated levels of methane above the water surface and even more in the water just below it is obvious that the source is the seabed

9203093 if the government were developing dharavi for the people who have been living here it would be ok
9203094 we bought it from some lady in a slum area she was given it by the government
9203095 we firmly believe that this is likely to be the way not just for dharavi but for the rest of indias slums and the worlds slums
9203096 the deployment of air power despite the regrettable civilian casualties can be seen as militarily appropriate
9203097 the sudden war in the caucasus has dealt a blow to us prestige
9203098 europes leaders have understood that they must act but the complicated rules and regulations that govern the interplay of the 27 eu states are an invitation to distraction and quarrel the war in georgia shows that europe urgently needs a president and it lacks a common foreign minister who can forge a common foreign policy from among 27 national sensitivities it is not impossible the governments are ready the lisbon treaty is written the problem is not them up there but us here below we would have had our eu treaty in january had the majority in ireland not said no
9203099 as things now stand the crisis has renewed debate on georgias membership at the nato summit in april in bucharest merkel and steinmeier played a major role in preventing ukraine and the caucasus country from joining the alliances membership action plan map now that hostilities have erupted the germans are happy to keep as much distance as possible between them and georgia
9203100 strong criticism of the german position has also emerged from the american election campaign us presidential candidate john mccain has warned that withholding fast track membership for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for attacks on georgia somehow this makes germany partly responsible for the war in the caucasus at least in mccains eyes and that does not bode well for germany should the republican be elected president in november berlin actually had hoped that it only had to get through the last few months of the bush administration and then everything would get better but no matter who is president germanys relationship with the us promises to be fraught with tension should america allow itself to be provoked by russia
9203101 i think that a clear political statement is once again very important in this situation georgia is a free and independent country and every free and independent country can decide together with the members of nato when and how it joins nato in december there will be an initial assessment of the situation and we are clearly on track for a nato membership
9203102 moscows military leaders are not really afraid of the us missile defense system ten us interceptor missiles stand against thousands of russian warheads should it come to that as usual the main point is the respect and recognition of a russia which still has not come to terms with its loss of superpower status
9203103 there are so many unanswered questions especially as to the purpose of the missile shield since iran is obviously not yet capable of atomic weaponry and the world community wants to prevent them from obtaining such weapons which missiles is the anti missile shield going to intercept what is the nature of the threat how much will it cost the german taxpayer will there be further armament projects
9203104 concerns about possible threats emanating from putins unpredictable empire were never far from the minds of warsaw politicians after all have its eu partners in the west not criminally underestimated this danger and left the countries of eastern europe to fend for themselves against the russian bear time and time again in the past brussels did nothing when russia beat up on the baltic states with arbitrary trade restrictions when it launched a full scale cyber war against estonia and when it used specious arguments to ban polish food imports and thats not even mentioning the weak support given to the young wobbly ukrainian democracy as russia attempted to strong arm it
9203105 behind the delaying tactics is the hope that a new us administration under barack obama or hillary clinton will push the expensive missile defense with less determination than the republican bush
9203106 in eastern europe a new discussion about russia is developing that considers both the domestic and foreign policies being followed in the kremlin this mindset does not necessarily mean a new split of the nato alliance into the old us critical europeans and the new pro american europeans but it does show that the large european countries like germany and france must show more deference to the eastern european worldview
9203107 prague and warsaw are betting that their countries will be strategically more important for the united states and thus they will enjoy greater protection in the future all this is happening because of fear of ever more aggressive russia in western europe which did not experience a soviet invasion and martial law this fear is often mocked as being outdated but the recent russian invasion of georgia shows that it is a very relevant issue
9203108 that poland considering its past history with russia lacks the will to structure its priorities in another way lets say european is understandable but that the administration in washington at this point is pushing a cold war mood and is further splitting the alliance partners can mean only one thing that the current authorities have not learned from the mistakes of the past
9203109 i could not stand america this president bush has turned my homeland into a developing country everything is ailing infrastructure schools political institutions
9203110 i was happy to find an alternative to life in america
9203111 if barack obama wins the presidential elections then sooner or later i will return to the usa
9203112 obama makes us proud of our homeland we now once again have a r reason to love our country
9203113 americans have high expectations for the successor of george w bush the united states the greatest world power of all times has lost its authority bush stands for the war in iraq torture at abu ghraib for legal inflection in guantanamo for a reckless environmental policy the new president will have to clean up repair rectify he will have to give the country a new direction and the rest of the world as well
9203114 mccains supporters are older white and uneducated men by contrast obamas quasi european voters are female but especially young and smart
9203115 if democrats want to win they will have to rid themselves of their european appearance
9203116 i support ideas for the rest of the world barack embodies a new america and the rest of the world as well as the usa have earned a new america
9203117 a visible sign that the important thing in these deliberations is love is the rainbow flag that flew over the hamburg city hall from july 31 to august 3 to commemorate the local gay pride celebration
9203118 the cdu is germanys leading conservative party and its attitude toward creating a legal foundation for registered same sex partnerships has ranged from reluctance to rejection i am committed to attaining complete equality between married couples and registered life partners but in germany the time for this unfortunately has not yet arrived in germany many conservative people attach every bit as much importance to the remaining legal differences between heterosexual spouses and same sex partners as conservatives in the united states attach to the exclusive use of the term marriage to describe the bond between a man and a woman
9203119 a chair for the sick with small wheels the kind you see in old us movies
9203120 i would not exclude having said that but if they are going to provide us with such a splendid contraption they can at least help us out with it
9203121 prepared to fundamentally reconsider the course of us foreign policy
9203122 prohibiting obama from speaking at the gate would be like prohibiting foreign politicians from speaking at the national mall in washington just because martin luther king held his big speech there in 1963
9203123 when is he coming who will he meet and more importantly what will he say
9203124 the senator from illinois must take care not to seem overly pro european
9203125 its therefore unlikely that obama will wax lyrical about europes leadership on combating climate change or health insurance
9203126 there is a certain irony to it all it took a major war for george w bush to strain the transatlantic relationship but for his wannabe successor the campaigning senator from illinois all it takes is a speech announcement
9203127 what would otherwise be criticized as pretentious attention getting in the case of obama the social democrats it is labeled as
9203128 the awacs deployment may be logical but it shows once again how the german bundeswehr is logical step by logical step stumbling into the fighting in afghanistan overall it is a worrying development
9203129 attention must be given to this continuing scandal this incomprehensible stupidity this appalling result of imperial arrogance now that the united states has opened a new embassy building in such a spectacular location next to the brandenburg gate exactly there where 69 years ago there was an earlier embassy even if then as now without an ambassador he was recalled to washington after the reichspogromnacht november 9 10 1938 of the nazis against the jews today nothing has de facto changed although william r timken who holds the title of ambassador is physically present in the capital of the germans politically he is absent completely and he has absolutely nothing to say to germans at all
9203130 not only because subway security is taken much more seriously from new york to los angeles subway stations have security cameras and sheriffs more importantly drunkenness cannot be used as a mitigating factor to reduce prison sentences on the contrary it is illegal to drink under the age of 21 and in most states criminals who are 18 years old are treated as adults in some states this is the case even for 16 and 17 year olds
9203131 it is sick the heart it is empty it is old wrinkled used it beats only weakly it is slowly bleeding it offers little hope oh america how could it come to this there where the new man struggled to build his utopia of a new world with sweat on his brow but always aware while working his own piece of ground that he was a gentlemen servant to no one there where the air smelled like the sweet fragrance of freedom and the horizon reached to an infinite distance there in rural america in the heart of the nation in their mythical heartland the hard times are there to stay it was destroyed when agriculture rediscovered itself as an industry which required fewer workers and certainly no free self centered people
9203132 it is a symbol of how america deals with the war it started in the middle east thereby provoking the return of the protest culture he wants for the president to get lost and for the war to end
9203133 then it comes to the highpoint in georgia they play impeach the president the audience feeling lucky and besides themselves to be able to see the four ageing hippies crosby stills nash and young one last time in their lives becomes indignant there is a war going on and who turns his back on the country with such heavenly music deserves ripped up concert tickets and booing because pop and politics are two different things in predominantly apolitical in america
9203134 d j vu the film is way too late in considering the american presidential campaign one must instinctively think of a more recent campaign that of candidate barack obama the attacks on president bush are now outdated
9203135 popcorn meets provocation while the new american embassy on pariser platz was opened with great excitement last weekend a few hundred metres on the unter den linden a very different america is on display this is about sex and violence war and anti war demonstrations uniforms and naked bodies judaism and anti semitism
9203136 as a land of inner turmoil and deep identity crisis
9203137 i tokio hotel sono abbastanza appariscenti per essere considerati una gradita alternativa per tutti gli adolescenti che sono irritati dagli zuccherini della disney come miley cirus o i jonas brothers

9203153 i have to give a gold star to my home state this week
9203154 there is continuing debate about how the financial side of this will work out and its clear that everyone is watching massachusetts to see how this experiment goes one fact stood out to me in the reports though the boston globe says that visits by the uninsured to community health centers and hospitals dropped by 37 from july 2007 to september 2007 compared with the same time period the year before
9203155 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9203156 i never had any doubts i was building a bomb we had to do it
9203157 rather than put the collection in archives i think its very important for young people as well as prospective students and alums that will come back to look at it and just remember gee this is what i remember when i was here
9203158 there were times when ive been at some meeting and obviously the auction closes out but thats the fun of the chase
9203159 when you walk into bills office you see so much history that is often left untold and unseen
9203160 but one thing ive really taken to heart from working with bill is that your education is something that no one can ever take away from you he encouraged me to pursue and complete my degree in business management and he has taught me to listen to problems and strategize on the best way to approach them and solve them
9203161 i was blown away that somebody so important a university vice president would care that much about what i was doing as a senior
9203162 i will never forget how he masterfully combined his professional attitude with sincere care and sensitivity in dealing with all types of people whenever i mention his name to someone everyone has only the most wonderful things to say about his character and leadership ability
9203163 i want to be the kind of leader who is dedicated to and loves my work and relates to every person with an equal level of sensitivity and respect
9203164 with multiple joints the bots provide mobility in confined situations
9203165 if i could support the students on this project then i could keep the project alive

9203167 melanie was an excellent chemistry student in my group with a passion for public service
9203168 providing a rich environment for learning in and out of the classroom is a vital part of the carnegie mellon education
9203169 many of the events courses and learning experiences offered this fall show our commitment to having a variety of experiences available to the carnegie mellon community
9203170 my plan is to offer a weekend course focused on one country like this each semester
9203171 i come from a family of physicians but i am primarily interested in social science and the law as a way of helping people
9203172 i believe that the status of refugees is a policy issue that can be improved through attention and proper management
9203173 our message took me through the closed doors of a senate subcommittee hearing to the open podium at the national press club and a range of other unique and inspiring experiences
9203174 despite a never ending to do list and the need to adapt to a constantly fluctuating global arena there was a sincere and pervasive dedication to the cause of bringing awareness and hopefully an end to the suffering of the people in darfur
9203175 i think it is important in todays global world and economy that the best and brightest young people such as carnegie mellon students have the opportunity to develop a solid understanding of the political process
9203176 these internships give the students a chance to see washington from the inside and cultivate the skills and connections they will need to have a real impact when they go out into the world

9203185 el arsenal es un gran equipo pero el milan es uno de los mejores clubes del mundo he visto que en italia se trabaja m s que en la premier
9203186 podr disponer de minutos para continuar su progresi n como jugador
9203187 lo primordial es empezar jugando y ganarme la confianza del m ster ya que con minutos podr dar muchas cosas al equipo tras haber podido comprobar que los dirigentes del alav s conf an mucho en m y a partir de ahora s lo me queda cumplir todas esas expectativas y marcar goles

9203197 slandering the syrian leadership and lying before an international tribunal regarding the killing of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri
9203198 illegitimate links with the zionist enemy undermining the prestige of the state and of national sentiment and worst of all plotting with a foreign country to launch an aggression against syria
9203199 we are concerned over the fate of syrian kurdish activist mashaal tammo whose disturbing arrest is the most recent of a string of detentions of civil society activists by the syrian government
9203200 we condemn the detention of tammo and other syrian prisoners of conscience and call for their immediate and unconditional release by the syrian government
9203201 we encourage the international community to join us in calling on the syrian government to stop its policy of arresting critics of the regime
9203202 as a jewel of gold in a swines snout so is a beautiful woman without discretion
9203203 i desire that women adorn themselves in respectable apparel with modesty and self control not with finely braided hair or gold or pearls or costly attire but which is appropriate to women professing godliness with good works
9203204 do not let your adorning be external the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry or the clothing you wear but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit which in gods sight is very precious
9203205 take the millstones and grind flour put off your veil strip off your robe uncover your legs pass through the rivers your nakedness shall be uncovered and your disgrace shall be seen

9203209 weve put a 7m bid on the table to manchester united the complexities of their situation are that it depends on them getting one in that one might well be bulgarian as i said all the way through the summer we need to be respectful of that and theres nothing i can do to force the situation if they do bring someone in i want to be at the front of the queue and i will do whatever it takes to bring him to the football club people alluding to the fact weve got carried away with ourselves but i can absolutely guarantee that im here for the long term building the football club and we are going to have to get braver in some of the things we do but it will never be at the cost of threatening the security and financial ability of the club long term

9203358 thats what i do by instinct when i wake up in the morning i write songs and produce records for artists it was a perfect fit it just made sense for me to go ahead and be the one to bring the m tley record home
9203359 no i actually first started working with nikki and writing for m tley during the new tattoo phase nikki and i wrote six songs together for that record thats really when nikki and i became friends we realized we had such a great time writing together we have such chemistry and compliment one another very well we knew we were going to be doing other things together thats kind of the way the sixx a m thing has happened
9203360 im sure that there was i would have some anxiety about it if i were them but i think thats the case with any new producer coming into the picture especially somebody as young as me michael is 39 being handed the wheel also my track record speaks for itself ive worked with the scorpions sammy hagar meat loaf and blondie i think it was a bit easier to win their trust than somebody without that kind of experience
9203361 ive got to say and this isnt just a fluffy answer i was more concerned about whose balls i was going to have to bust the most than it actually being a reality these guys all knew how important this record was when we were in the writing stage of this record thats when we challenged each other the most and pushed each other the most we had to start off with strong songs if we didnt have that we didnt have a record it was a huge undertaking to figure out what the tone and the sound of this record was going to be when you have a band thats been around as long as they have spanning a couple decades if not more that means youve accumulated a very diverse crowd and fan base i knew right off the bat we wouldnt be able to please all of these fans so very early on we decided both sonically and song wise to be as honest as we can about the career these guys have had thats why we loosely based this record on their autobiography the dirt it gave us a starting point then the challenge became how do we span that much time that was something we had to pay a lot of attention to as you listen to the record it starts off in their very early punk days when their recordings had a much more raw feel then you get into down at the whisky lyrically thats one of my favorite songs on the record it stirs up so much emotion in the listener back to your question i think we all pushed each other very hard i couldnt single out one band member that was problematic at all they all showed up with their a game they all approached this like it was their first and most important record theyve ever made
9203362 n o queremos tentar imitar pequim o que queremos s o novas formas de pensar a cerim nia de abertura

9203443 but i think it would be early days yet and we should wait until the clarke inquiry concludes before we go down that path
9203444 its difficult to know why it took so long it shouldnt have and i believe that it was just mainly the afp playing games with mohameds freedom

9203511 as far as chemotherapy side effects go ive had a week from hell
9203512 a heartfelt thank you to my chemo nurses and hospital pharmacists for coming up with a concoction of drugs to get me through two days in the television studios clocking up some 22 hours of work and looking upbeat the whole time
9203513 the pads protest raise questions and doubt for people who heard that it was nonviolent as we have seen television and website broadcast it did not seem to be so does nonviolent simply mean unarmed or that no one is physically hurt others
9203514 considering what pads have been proclaiming that they want to bring about democratic change can they be the change and democratic
9203515 this is getting silly now as a foreigner who has lived in thailand for three years and often sympathized with the pad ive lost all patience and respect for that group and i hope the pad leaders are brought to justice and that the government does not buckle to the demands being made
9203516 doesnt seem much popular support left for the pad they got carried away by pitiful issues such as preah vihear and ran nonstop through town demanding this and condemning that and are staging a revolution that shall bring thailand which leadership heaven forbid any pad success would divide the kingdom even more deeper no disrespect but the pads current actions and false fronts work for the benefit of samak
9203517 this is a fascist movement of course because this is thailand and an asian country on the periphery of world affairs nobody will care but this is what fascism looks like in the 21st century
9203518 there was noticeably less traffic on the roads this morning so much so that my taxi driver had no qualms about going past one of the pad demonstrations close to government house the few protesters i saw were very normal mostly female and a far cry from the mobs that took control of some government offices yesterday there are a lot of ordinary people supporting these protests
9203519 if the organizers could not manage proper toilet and shower corner it would be more difficult to female protesters to stay some post in manager webboard ask for donation of flashlight whistle helmets umbrellas hat fans towels tissue paper plastic bags and rubber band to be used as makeshift toilet other requested female and male underwear

9203590 we worked so hard on the race setting that we only had time to use two qualifiers at the end instead of the usual three
9203591 with the first one i used a new front which needed a couple of laps to get scrubbed in so i came in to change the rear and whilst it was good it wasnt as good as the first one so the lap time could have been better but all in all im delighted to be on pole again its going to be a long tough race tomorrow but im looking forward to it
9203592 im happy about our work because we did a good job with the qualifying tires this afternoon and we were able to improve with each one which is important
9203593 in the end we couldnt match caseys time but anyway second on the grid is good for the race
9203594 were without two of our fellow competitors this weekend in toriano wilson and luciano ribodino what happened has made a deep impact on all of us
9203595 were all trying to recover from the tragedy our deepest condolences go out to torianos family friends and fans we also give lucho our best wishes as he goes through his recovery we will race this weekend like toriano would have wanted but well do so with both toriano and lucho in our thoughts
9203596 its exciting to race in front of my family and friends and hopefully i can put it on the box or at least get a top five this weekend
9203597 lately i have been qualifying better and i hope to see that trend continue this is really my first year racing and learning how to be a better racer has been my goal im used to the ktm rc 125 and once i got some idea on the setup its going better i have learned how to communicate what i need with my mechanic and weve gotten some good results ill really be pushing hard to get it done again this weekend
9203598 were all good friends off the track but its a battle royale out there on the track
9203599 it would definitely be cool for me to make the riders cup because i know red bull motogp rookies cup champion j d beach and it would be fun to race him and it would be great to meet some of the other kids too i think it will take more than just a top ten to get in the riders cup which for me is possible at this track its my home circuit but a lot of the other guys have been there too so that should make it interesting
9203600 im feeling really good i got the stitches out of my hand and i am super stoked to get back out there
9203601 ill have a lot of family and friends at the race and i want to get a top five for sure road atlanta is a really good track i like the way it flows and it has some nice off camber turns that are challenging there should be a lot of passing going on i have checked out the new section and it looks like a turn i would like a lot of hard braking down the hill
9203602 we have quite a few rookies that can earn one of the riders cup slots with a good result at road atlanta
9203603 i think well have more riders concerned about the points more than ever we have a tight spread for those last couple of spots it will be a challenging race some of the rookies have some experience here but they have never ridden the track on these bikes and the circuit is also a bit different

9203635 hab amos dormido en el monte y mis hijas suplicaban por comida as que volvimos despu s de que el lechero nos dijo que en el salado no hab an entrado los paras
9203636 estamos en el salado no joda salgan partida de guerrilleros que todo el mundo se muere hoy
9203637 cuando llegamos a el salado mandamos a recoger la gente y la reunimos en la plaza junto a la iglesia los desertores se alaban a los guerrilleros y los bamos ejecutando

9203643 los delincuentes de las auc emplearon en sus actos delictivos a guerrilleros de las farc que los guiaron hasta los campamentos del frente 37
9203644 la modalidad de realizar actos delictivos de civil por parte de los bandoleros de las farc les permite confundirse con la poblaci n civil y pasar a ser campesinos en el momento de un enfrentamiento armado
9203645 los medios de comunicaci n por su af n de tener la primicia no manejan informaciones oficiales por el contrario multiplican el drama de las familias y desinforman a la opini n p blica

9203647 waiting for government alone to provide these essential life supports for the people is difficult because many needs are chasing little funds in the national coffers
9203648 inclusive growth and the role of knowledge lessons from china and asia
9203649 it is helpful to have large domestic market however if an economys industries are consistent with its comparative advantage their products can have global markets therefore large domestic market is not a necessary condition
9203650 the government in a developing country that follows the caf strategy may play a more active role than that of a minimal state
9203651 nos sorprendi encontrar que antes de que una mosca vuele en respuesta a la amenaza de un depredador o un matamoscas sta planea la direcci n de su salto haciendo una serie de complejos movimientos
9203652 el objetivo de estos movimientos para planear la hu da dice el profesor dickinson logran posicionar cuidadosamente el cuerpo del insecto para que las patas queden situadas en la mejor posici n para escapar en direcci n opuesta de la inminente amenaza
9203653 estos movimientos son muy r pidos toman unos 200 milisegundos
9203654 esto ilustra la rapidez con la que el cerebro de la mosca puede procesar la informaci n sensorial y convertirla en una respuesta motora apropiada
9203655 esto quiere decir que la mosca debe integrar la informaci n visual de sus ojos con la informaci n mecanosensorial de sus piernas
9203656 life is more than party t shirts and perhaps 10 ghana cedis

9203658 desagraviar mi honor y compromiso profesional lastimados no por la intenci n del articulista sino por el juego democr tico de fuentes que deben enfocar donde se encuentran y no tratar de encubrirlas se alando injustamente para otro lado
9203659 me siento en similar situaci n a la de una v ctima a la que se le dispara a muy corta distancia para que los homicidas puedan pretextar un suicidio y el se or fiscal general de la naci n por motivos o situaciones que de pronto desconozco guarda discreto silencio frente al agravio funcional y profesional
9203660 fue la mejor decisi n y el factor determinante fue la postura del gobierno de respetar la autonom a s lo incidieron los factores que ten an que incidir
9203661 lo importante es que acatamos y apoyamos el fallo de la corte en el que vemos una grand sima oportunidad para corregir los problemas que hay en el sistema
9203662 es incre ble que la mitad de las tutelas de salud que interponen los colombianos son tratamientos procedimientos o medicamentos que est n en el plan obligatorio de salud pero por alguna raz n las entidades no las prestan a sus usuarios y las autoridades hacen nada o muy poco para exigir su prestaci n eso hizo que la tutela se convirtiera en un requisito para prestar el servicio y en una especie de factura para cobrarlo ante el fosyga que administra los recursos de la salud
9203663 actualmente las eps est n en una complicada situaci n econ mica y algunas est n al borde de la quiebra por eso creemos que la sentencia es tan profunda que necesariamente le pondr orden al sistema y har que entre en una segunda etapa
9203664 el fallo que acierta en poner a las personas como el eje del sistema tiene tres grandes riesgos el primero es que se requiere una discusi n y un acuerdo nacional sobre el plan de salud que debe tener el pa s porque de lo contrario se podr a terminar con uno ilimitado imposible de pagar el segundo es que el estado puede caer en una duplicidad en el gasto al subsidiar al mismo tiempo a los pobres y a los hospirales y el ltimo es c mo mantener la fortaleza del gimen constributivo que en timas soporta el sistema de salud
9203665 esto no tiene nada que ver con el negocio pues ella no maneja la operaci n
9203666 pagamos 135 000 millones de pesos hubo un retraso en la comercializaci n y s lo el 20 por ciento de las personas estuvo inconforme se renegociaron los plazos
9203667 es un documento at pico que genera una serie de incertidumbres no se puede asegurar si con quien se hace el contrato es solvente ni si se pueden exigir los derechos

9203702 if you have ever been robbed by a black teen aged male you know unbelievably fleet footed they can be
9203703 given the inefficiencies of what the dc laughably calls the criminal justice system i think we can safely assume that 95 percent of the black males in that city are semi criminal or criminal
9203704 opinion polls consistently show that only five percent of blacks have sensible political opinions i e support the free market individual liberty and the end of welfare and affirmative action
9203705 shockingly irresponsible to place her a heartbeat away from the presidency when it was pointed out that if anything barack obama had even less experience and that barack obama is actually running for president begala did not bother to respond to that issue

9203710 would you be willing to meet separately without precondition during the first year of your administration in washington or anywhere else with the leaders of iran syria venezuela cuba and north korea in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries
9203711 so the kennedys decided were going to do an air lift
9203712 in reality barack obama sr was awarded a sponsored scholarship in economics to the university of hawaii at manoa he was not part of an airlift
9203713 i am a christian and i am a devout christian i believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of jesus christ i believe that that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life but most importantly i believe in the example that jesus set by feeding the hungry and healing the sick and always prioritizing the least of these over the powerful i didnt fall out in church as they say but there was a very strong awakening in me of the importance of these issues in my life i didnt want to walk alone on this journey accepting jesus christ in my life has been a powerful guide for my conduct and my values and my ideals there is one thing that i want to mention that i think is important part of what weve been seeing during the course this campaign is some scurrilous e mails that have been sent out denying my faith talking about me being a muslim suggesting that i got sworn in the u s senate with a quran in my hand or that i dont pledge allegiance to the flag i think its really important for your readers to know that i have been a member of the same church for almost 20 years and i have never practiced islam i am respectful of the religion but its not my own one of the things thats very important in this day and age is that we dont use religion as a political tool and certainly that we dont lie about religion as a way to score political points i just thought it was important to get that in there to dispel rumors that have been over the internet weve done so repeatedly but obviously its a political tactic of somebody to try to provide this misinformation

9203750 gov sarah palin r alaska has denied the threats facing polar bears and has led her states efforts to gun down wolves from airplanes and helicopters
9203751 the palin administration has waged an all out war on alaskas predators to artificially boost the populations of moose and caribou for trophy hunters and has tried to pass legislation making it easier for state officials to gun down wolves and bears from the sky
9203752 last year the state offered a 150 bounty as an incentive for pilots and aerial gunners to kill more wolves
9203753 her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear

9203760 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9203761 sarah palin will wow cultural conservatives in areas where they may not have come out to vote before the selection this is right out of karl roves strategy of getting more of your own to show up and vote in fact as palins cultural views become better known she oppose abortion in all cases and opposes the use of birth control pills and condoms even among married couples she will undoubtedly scare the hell out of the soccer moms and 98 of hillary voters in fact many of these women may feel insulted by this choice in that mccain and the gop think they are stupid and would bypass their own interest reproductive and economic to vote for the ticket due to gender and anger that hillary was not the nominee in my estimation as a pollster and analyst while historic for the gop in selecting their first woman on a national ticket this choice may be the worst selection by a major party nominee for president in modern times

9203791 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9203792 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9203793 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9203794 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9203795 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9203796 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9203797 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9203798 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9203799 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9203800 who are open to doing something on the production side
9203801 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9203802 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9203803 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9203804 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9203805 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9203806 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9203807 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9203808 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9203809 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9203810 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9203811 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9203812 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9203813 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9203814 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9203815 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9203816 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9203817 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9203818 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9203819 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9203820 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9203821 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9203822 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9203823 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9203824 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9203825 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9203826 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

9203836 obwohl ich dunst weit interessanter finde aber megan ist einfach die bessere troph e
9203837 the navy seals are highly respected and admired for their vital role in national defense
9203838 that they would choose chicago for this initiative speaks well of our city it gives us an opportunity to showcase the many talented and fit individuals who live in our great city and it challenges the rest of us to step it up a notch
9203839 this challenge is a means to encourage citizens of chicago and its suburbs to improve fitness and to utilize our seal standard as a way to measure their own level of fitness
9203840 were hoping for an unprecedented number of competitors of all fitness levels to rise to the challenge
9203841 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9203842 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9203843 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9203844 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9203845 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9203846 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9203847 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9203848 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9203849 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9203850 in all fairness as incompetent and unqualified she might be i highly doubt she could do as much damage as bush amp co those incompetent warmongering oil grabbing idiots
9203851 yes he could have picked ruch limbaugh sean hannity or bill oreilly as his running mate
9203852 the louisiana national guard is fully prepared for a hurricane disaster and has improved reaction times communication and equipment resources by learning from hurricanes katrina and rita
9203853 throughout the year the louisiana national guard in coordination with other state and local agencies has conducted numerous statewide emergency response exercises testing capabilities and validating plans to improve overall efficiency and reaction time these coordinated efforts were and continue to be crucial to our current success
9203854 the soldiers will be staged in south louisiana in order to provide assistance in a moments notice
9203855 se apoyan los pactos territoriales que han ido surgiendo en diferentes zonas de la comunitat
9203856 movilizar todos los recursos disponibles en un territorio desde una estrategia aceptada por todos los agentes implicados siempre en el marco del di logo y el consenso
9203857 fomentar el desarrollo econ mico en el mbito local y la generaci n de nuevos puestos de trabajo
9203858 activar el desarrollo local y la creaci n de empleo en su mbito de actuaci n
9203859 apoya el primer pacto territorial para el empleo en el a o 2000 con la firma de un convenio con el consorcio del acuerdo comarcal por el empleo en l horta sud
9203860 son un m todo de trabajo basado en la cooperaci n p blico privada cuyo fin es el desarrollo del territorio y de las personas
9203861 implantados en un determinado territorio descubren las dificultades y oportunidades en materia de empleo adem s de movilizar los recursos disponibles para conseguir una mayor coordinaci n de las medidas para favorecer la creaci n de nuevos puestos de trabajo
9203862 a trav s del trabajo conjunto debemos seguir incentivando la creaci n de empleo especialmente en actividades de alto valor a adido que generen trabajos de elevada productividad y de calidad
9203863 asumen que el desarrollo de los territorios no es responsabilidad exclusiva del gobierno estatal ni de las autoridades regionales
9203864 tambi n los gobiernos locales los agentes sociales y los empresarios han de desarrollar un papel activo en la promoci n de la econom a y el empleo
9203865 ser a quitar el trabajo que los compa eros realizaron anteriormente
9203866 el cambio de ciclo volviendo a la militancia y al papel fundamental de futuro
9203867 es la nica que hace propuestas y que mira a la cara ofreciendo un partido moderno e inteligente
9203868 con la cara muy alta los pies en la tierra y el coraz n a la izquierda
9203869 entender el pspv es entender una forma de hacer la pol tica ante madrid y ante bruselas
9203870 el centro es un pasillo largo donde las puertas dan a la derecha
9203871 el centro es un pasillo muy largo donde todas la puertas dan a la derecha
9203872 partido de izquierdas que se entienda con las socialdemocracias m s avanzadas de europa
9203873 es salir con fuerza con nimo y convicci n de victoria
9203874 so ar con que los valencianos sean l deres con ir a madrid y participar en la acci n pol tica que afecta al conjunto de espa a
9203875 tiene el mejor proyecto la mejor iniciativa y las ganas de quitar al presidente de la generalita francisco camps del consell
9203876 es una ficha m s del ajedrez de paj n
9203877 los ciudadanos han de ser conscientes de que mientras sube la deuda p blica de la generalitat valenciana la situaci n del sistema educativa empeora
9203878 una muestra de ello es el incremento de los barracones escolares como punta del iceberg de un sistema educativo falto de recursos
9203879 otro ejemplo es la asfixia a la que el font de mora ha sometido a las universidades p blicas valencianas
9203880 la sociedad del conocimiento b sica para afrontar la crisis econ mica no existe para el gobierno valenciano
9203881 mientras la generalitat despilfarra el dinero p blico en eventos sin rentabilidad social econ mica o ambiental no se invierte en elementos b sicos como es la educaci n
9203882 que los ni os valencianos no disponen de las mismas infraestructuras que los ni os de otras comunidades
9203883 en extremadura existe un ordenador por cada dos ni os y en la comunitat la proporci n es de un ordenador por cada 14 ni os
9203884 esta situaci n es muy grave y penaliza especialmente a la escuela p blica
9203885 funciona en base a ocurrencias en materia educativa como ense ar en ingl s la asignatura de educaci n para la ciudadan a apc o atacar la democracia en los centros
9203886 mas recursos para educaci n y que se evite la utilizaci n de la escuela valenciana como banco de pruebas en la confrontaci n entre los modelos educativos del pp y el psoe en el conjunto del estado
9203887 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9203888 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9203889 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9203890 por sus m ritos adquiridos en 8 a os de gobierno reaccionario y oscurantista en la espa a de finales del xx y principios del xxi
9203891 apuesto a que encuentro 100 000 personas que detestan a jos mar a aznar
9203892 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9203893 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9203894 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9203895 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9203896 la concepci n de cr ditos comunes que permita a un estudiante poder cambiar de carrera con el objetivo de no perder alumnado
9203897 si esto fuera posible deber amos facilitar la movilidad entre universidades porque es ir a favor del proceso de bolonia en nuestro propio sistema
9203898 crear unos estudios troncales con cr ditos intercambiables para moverse con facilidad de una o a otra instituci n
9203899 exige una labor de coordinaci n que nosotros promoveremos porque la autonom a universitaria es indudable
9203900 una cosa que hay que atender es la demanda es el gran elemento que hemos de tener presente
9203901 tampoco se puede extinguir una titulaci n que tenga potencia en s misma y que est poco demanda por razones de su exigencia
9203902 establecer un di logo fluido haciendo hincapi en que una parte sustancial de la financiaci n debe estar dirigida al cumplimiento de objetivos y a lograr unos est ndares cuantificables que hagan objetiva la asignaci n de fondos
9203903 que se fije con consenso y solidez intelectual para asentar unas bases que lo hagan duradero para un per odo de al menos una d cada
9203904 no podemos estar cada tres a os con el mismo problema
9203905 por razones que no conozco parece que hay ciertas reticencias
9203906 la viu puede trabajar si las universidades quieren con acuerdos m s puntuales sobre las titulaciones que les interese tener colgadas en internet
9203907 comienza el retorno vacacional para un gran n mero de ciudadanos situaci n que se prolongar hasta el primer d a de septiembre por lo que se ha tenido en cuenta esta circunstancia a la hora de aplicar una serie de medidas
9203908 se trata de un per odo en el que se prev n miles de desplazamientos en las carreteras valencianas por lo que se ha puesto un dispositivo esencial para atender cualquier emergencia que pueda surgir
9203909 para dar respuesta a las llamadas de emergencia de los ciudadanos y as estar preparados ante cualquier incremento de llamadas que pueda producirse respecto a un domingo normal
9203910 ante situaciones o periodos que suponen un incremento del riesgo la generalitat adopta medidas preventivas para garantizar la respuesta ante cualquier situaci n de emergencia as como para tratar de minimizar los riesgos
9203911 mayor expurgo de documentos oficiales del archivo provincial de valencia que se ha realizado en la historia de espa a
9203912 por un lado se consigue descongestionar los edificios judiciales reciclando aquellos expedientes que no est n en tr mite
9203913 por otro catalogar y registrar aquellos que por su inter s social hist rico o cultural deban ser archivados
9203914 tras el exhaustivo an lisis y clasificaci n de los fondos que se encuentran en el archivo provincial de valencia se van a destruir un total de 2 114 768 expedientes
9203915 m s de 215 toneladas de papel y cart n ser n recicladas
9203916 no s lo se conseguir un ahorro de espacio sino que tambi n se contribuir a la conservaci n del medio ambiente
9203917 todos estos documentos son expedientes que no tienen valor hist rico
9203918 puedan recuperar la documentaci n aportada por las partes en su causa
9203919 tienen derecho al resarcimiento tal y como se especifica en la ley de memoria hist rica motivo por el cual estos expedientes son archivados de nuevo
9203920 los documentos pertenecientes a la riada de 1957 o a la pantanada de tous tambi n ser n archivados
9203921 otros de inter s hist rico o cultural que ser n remitidos tras ser desjudicializados a los diversos archivos de la comunitat para su conservaci n
9203922 el proyecto adem s de un importante impacto potencial presenta elevadas garant as de viabilidad de pertinencia y de sostenibilidad en un sector clave como el desarrollo de la mujer en el segundo pa s menos desarrollado del mundo
9203923 colaboramos con cruz roja en m ltiples acciones que desarrollan para las personas inmigrantes como son los servicios de informaci n orientaci n y asesoramiento en jornadas y m dulos formativos en la creaci n de grupos de autoayuda y en la potenciaci n del voluntariado inmigrante entre otras muchas
9203924 aunque puede vincularse con las secuencias del obrador juanes macip
9203925 conducen a un contexto pict rico imbuido de las f rmulas juanescas tan ampliamente difundidas en tierras valencianas en el siglo xvi
9203926 apuesta por la formaci n a trav s de un amplio plan de becas en internacionalizaci n con el que ofrece a las empresas personal cualificado que facilite el desarrollo de estrategias empresariales para incrementar su competitividad en los mercados exteriores
9203927 en concreto durante este primer semestre del a o 72 empresas de todos los sectores de la comunitat valenciana han contado con un becario ivex
9203928 la gran mayor a de aulas prefabricadas con las que se inici el pasado curso
9203929 las aulas prefabricadas habilitadas no barracones tienen car cter temporal y en la mayor a de los casos son consecuencia de la reubicaci n del alumnado como causa de las obras del nuevo centro
9203930 son consecuencia del incremento de las obras y siempre seg n el criterio de la comunidad educativa que prefiere prefabricadas que doble turno
9203931 y se hacen muchas obras y la soluci n transitoria para reubicar al alumnado es el empleo de prefabricadas
9203932 el consell est respondiendo positivamente a la presi n demogr fica de incremento del alumnado
9203933 somos la comunidad aut noma que m s dinero presupuestario destina a la educaci n
9203934 nosotros acometer amos este fin del trasvase asegurando que en el levante tienen resueltos sus problemas de abastecimiento
9203935 la fecha del trasvase permite que en su momento el levante tenga resuelto el tema del abastecimiento
9203936 vamos a hacer un esfuerzo de explicaci n porque sabemos que no se entiende bien explicaci n a los dirigentes nacionales del psoe y del pp de lo que significa esta propuesta de lo que supone para castilla la mancha la hipoteca del trasvase tajo segura
9203937 es entendible que un dirigente nacional de un partido tenga una posici n distinta a la que tenemos en castilla la mancha en relaci n con el fin del trasvase pero lo que no se entiende es que la presidenta regional del pp mar a dolores de cospedal no aclare cu l va a ser su posici n en relaci n con el trasvase cuando hace poco m s de un a o vot a favor de su fin
9203938 no se entiende que de cospedal diga que haremos lo que tengamos que hacer cuando se supone que ella tiene que tener claro que estamos a favor del fin del trasvase es que ahora se est planteando de cospedal cambiar su posici n final
9203939 en la calle antonio ponz se ha completado la instalaci n de unos 34 sumideros e imbornales del tipo descrito es decir con poceta antiolores y antirretorno de los cuales dos unidades son del tipo pemap puntos de evacuaci n m xima de aguas pluviales
9203940 se trata de actuaciones que tienen como finalidad en primer lugar reducir las molestias que puedan producirse a los ciudadanos como consecuencia de los malos olores procedentes del alcantarillado y en segundo lugar reducir en lo posible las operaciones de limpieza de colectores por acumulaci n de materias s lidas procedentes de la calzada
9203941 corregiremos ese art culo como otros muchos que se han corregido en todos los estatutos
9203942 tienen la capacidad de decidir si algo est bien o est mal
9203943 nuestra voluntad es acordar con los grupos pol ticos y con el pp en particular la redacci n definitiva de este texto
9203944 nosotros hemos negociado con nuestras propias delegaciones parlamentarias de andaluc a castilla y le n valencia y catalu a
9203945 lo que s puedo decir es que en este oto o se va a tramitar ese estatuto
9203946 con absoluta lealtad solidaridad y sentido de la unidad al desarrollo auton mico libre y democr tico de espa a
9203947 importantes mejoras que garantizan el buen mantenimiento de la zona y mejoran su funcionamiento
9203948 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9203949 llevo un buen ritmo estoy bien f sicamente y mentalmente y creo que estoy en condiciones de aspirar a esa victoria que tanto me est costando
9203950 es una ficha m s del ajedrez de paj n
9203951 los extremos nunca son buenos y que en el centro es donde est la virtud
9203952 tanto romeu como el resto de candidatos socialistas tienen el mismo perfil caduco y estanco que en estos momentos tiene el partido socialista valenciano
9203953 deje de creerse que es m s especial que el resto porque al fin y al cabo todos ofrecen la misma imagen arcaica y anticuada de un pspv que conforme van pasando los d as va mostrando su cara m s obsoleta
9203954 la propia inseguridad del pspv le ha llevado a presentar en el c nclave socialista un dec logo de candidatos reciclados y sin ideas para el futuro de la comunitat
9203955 suban un pelda o m s para estar a la altura de la realidad de los ciudadanos ya que con su constante defensa ciega a las continuas meteduras de pata del gobierno socialista en la comunitat y su discurso anclado en el pasado el pspv no solo no renunciar al cambio sino que dar un paso atr s que perjudicar a los intereses de los ciudadanos
9203956 lleven a cabo un cambio radical en la l nea que hasta ahora han seguido los socialistas valencianos si de verdad quieren hacer algo por la comunitat
9203957 los constantes ataques de los socialistas valencianos al gobierno de camps y el ppcv s lo es un s ntoma de debilidad inseguridad y desconcierto que deja contra las cuerdas los intereses de los valencianos al no dar la talla como oposici n
9203958 es una ficha m s del ajedrez de paj n
9203959 contribuir a mejorar el servicio municipal a los ciudadanos a trav s de la web municipal
9203960 podr n acceder a ella a trav s del certificado digital y consultar on line algunos de sus expedientes

9203963 dispondr de todos los elementos necesarios para el emisi n de facturas electr nicas del ayuntamiento a trav s de la web sin necesidad de que el proveedor tenga que realizar inversi n alguna
9203964 permiten agilizar dicha gesti n ofreciendo un servicio de calidad a la ciudadan a

9203966 podr n acceder a la informaci n de cualquier expediente y realizar cualquier operaci n sobre el mismo desde cualquier lugar y en cualquier momento
9203967 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9203968 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9203969 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9203970 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9203971 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9203972 ayudar y fomentar la utilizaci n de los criterios uniformes y homog neos en los medios necesarios para las funciones de una polic a de seguridad moderna equipada y profesional
9203973 respuesta a la demanda de ayuda de los municipios de la comunitat
9203974 inestimable esfuerzo en recursos humanos y econ micos para poder adaptarse alas normas de homogeneizaci n que establece la legislaci n auton mica
9203975 se agudiza de una manera m s preocupante en aquellos municipios de escasa poblaci n y por tanto de escasos recursos econ micos que cuando deben adaptarse a las obligaciones previstas en el mbito reglamentario tienen que crear plazas de polic a y por supuesto costear su mantenimiento todo ello con cargo a los presupuestos generales de la corporaci n
9203976 est o muito preocupados com a situa o pela qual est passando
9203977 as esp cies foram coletadas ilegalmente nas bacias do rio negro e do rio solim es
9203978 ele falou que ia me matar e queimar a minha casa ele parecia drogado neste dia
9203979 ele ent o passou a morar nos fundos da minha casa foi nesta poca que ele disse que ia me matar porque eu sabia que a menina tinha sido morta e queimada nos fundos do barrac o
9203980 todo mundo tem medo dele por aqui ele j tinha matado em s o paulo e se eu soubesse disso n o aceitaria ele em minha casa
9203981 acho que minha filha n o quer voltar para belo horizonte mas se voltar n o quero ela aqui chega de problemas para o meu lado
9203982 este acordo abre as portas para a futura coopera o e parceria entre it lia e l bia
9203983 isso um reconhecimento completo e mora pelos danos infligidos l bia pela it lia durante a era colonial
9203984 as empresas italianas far o mais neg cios na l bia

9203988 i congratulated my team for getting a good result against a quality vcu team
9203989 im disappointed in our performance we have several things to work on as we move forward
9203990 for the lack of opportunities we had all night we got two quality services and were able to finish both of them
9203991 infelizmente s vezes a vida nos surpreende e n o d para antecipar ou prever como vamos reagir
9203992 ele n o se preocupou muito em esconder seu rosto ou identidade
9203993 ele sempre usava um anel caracter stico e foi assim que o reconhecemos

9204106 a pergunta mais importante que deveria ser feita n o se ela pode lhe ajudar a ganhar a presid ncia
9204107 se ela est qualificada e preparada para exercer o cargo caso algo impedisse mccain de desempenh lo
9204108 teria sido especialmente crucial para mccain que na sexta feira completou 72 anos tomar a decis o adequada
9204109 a falta de experi ncia de palin gera imediatas d vidas sobre qu o preparada ela est para suced lo em um dado momento na presid ncia
9204110 no caso de mccain que visto como um pol tico conservador em fun o da idade o an ncio de sarah muito positivo pois desfaz essa imagem e d um sopro de carisma ao republicano
9204111 hoje existe um dilema entre a mudan a e a conserva o de uma pol tica de seguran a implantada ap s o 11 de setembro esse conservadorismo uma forma de manter os americanos em seguran a mesmo que os custos da pol tica externa possam ser desastrosos
9204112 mccain est sugerindo um pa s seguro obama por sua vez ainda n o deixou claro a que veio
9204113 eles est o propondo uma modifica o grande tanto em rela o pol tica externa quanto para assuntos internos dos estados unidos mas parecem n o saber bem como isso ser feito
9204114 acredito que n o houve demora na escolha ela foi feita no momento certo sem explos o midi tica
9204115 a explora o midi tica em torno do candidato democrata deve continuar mas daqui pra frente as coisas devem se acalmar um pouco e a sim o programa do senador por illinois ser cobrado
9204116 obama que se transformou em um orador que h muito n o se via nos estados unidos percebeu que seu carisma ajuda a renovar o espet culo mas agora esse talento deve se converter em um tom mais pragm tico
9204117 minha filha essa campanha uma campanha municipal n s n o estamos fazendo nenhuma campanha presidencial aqui
9204118 ela n o passa falsidade no contato com as pessoas as campanhas exigem um olhar verdadeiro e isso ela tem
9204119 o problema da mudan a do n mero vai deixar de ser um obst culo a essa escolha livre de com quem contratar
9204120 a portabilidade por si s provoca uma maior competi o entre as empresas e isso beneficia o usu rio no sentido de diminuir o pre o melhorar a qualidade e o atendimento
9204121 a anatel estar acompanhando com especial cuidado esse momento e estar presente nas pr prias empresas para facilitar o tratamento desse assunto o consumidor ficar sem comunica o algo que n s encararemos com a m xima seriedade
9204122 como presidente da rep blica eu sou o presidente de todos os brasileiros numa campanha pol tica importante dizer eu tenho lado

9204131 like in the civil war i wasnt very rattled or anything when the lights come on i just have the ability to just go out and play
9204132 i think this group of guys has the potential to be the best group that ive played with here at oregon so far

9204141 the problem is not with recruitment but with winning we have presidential candidates but the problem is that theyre not winnable this is not to say that theyre not qualified and competent but they are not popular
9204142 we can always adopt candidates from other parties thats not a first time we did that with gma who was kampi president before
9204143 as early as the time of former speaker jdv he has been saying lets work first
9204144 unlike the others the vice president is not yet tied to any party
9204145 in politics anything can happen and it is pregnant with possibilities hindi natin alam we may be enemies today but friends tomorrow
9204146 are senators francis chiz escudero loren legarda manny villar or mar roxas opposition i want to correct the misconception that if you are criticizing the president or her government you are automatically opposition
9204147 we have an open door policy we believe that this country needs to unite and not divide our people the politicians especially when politicians reason and bargain with one another and not speak in forked tongues we can all get together as one
9204148 political parties such as the np which are supportive of the administrations programs and policies are welcome to become part of the administration alliance in 2010 and beyond
9204149 we envision one solid and strong republic with one strong administration party starting with the two largest lakas and kampi but never to the exclusion of our other allies who are supportive of the administrations programs and policies
9204150 im still very positive that we can have this merger although i am not discounting the possibility that some areas in the local level will remain a free zone on the overall ill be very happy if we can achieve a 95 percent success rate at uniting the local leaders including rival groups who are either with lakas or kampi
9204151 of course we will also consider other administration allies as part of a super alliance that we intend to have in 2010
9204152 i hope they will just talk but i really cant tell because they are the candidates
9204153 but it is better if they will not fight each other so that our group will remain intact i dont think it will affect the friendship but that is what senator pangilinan and i feel that they should talk
9204154 i would press the government not to continue the fighting even especially at the ramadan time
9204155 wir haben das gef hl dass wir morgen eine gute pace gehen k nnen auch wenn unsere pace auf eine schnelle runde nicht besonders ist aber bl d ist dass man motorrad reifen und auch den fahrer an die grenzen treibt wenn man schon in den ersten runden immer derma en attackieren muss
9204156 funktionieren zufrieden stellend aber es wird schwierig in den ersten runden so viele positionen aufzuholen wenn ich in der zweiten statt in der f nften reihe stehen w rde dann h tten wir offensichtlich bessere chancen auf ein gutes resultat immerhin haben wir ja noch das warmup vor uns und damit die gelegenheit mit dem motorrad fortschritte zu machen
9204157 ich hatte heute ein fantastisches auto und eine hervorragende letzte runde im qualifying ausgenommen kurve zehn denn da musste ich wegen gelber flaggen leicht lupfen
9204158 in der vergangenheit haben wir uns hier nicht immer so gut qualifiziert hatten hier aber am anfang des jahres einen tollen test
9204159 wir wussten also durchaus dass wir konkurrenzf hig sein w rden
9204160 im letzten umlauf ging es dann nur um alles oder nichts ich war ja eh schon in der ersten startreihe ich habe jeden zentimeter des asphalts ausgenutzt und profitierte nat rlich auch davon dass der kurs von runde zu runde mehr grip bot ich fahre ab sofort berall auf sieg sofern die zusatzgewichte das zulassen
9204161 ich bin etwas entt uscht denn mein letzter und schnellster reifensatz war richtig klasse doch ich wurde von einem der t rkisen bmw aufgehalten der vor mir auf der ideallinie herumfuhr ohne das h tte ich sicherlich in der region von rob liegen k nnen denn das auto war das ganze wochenende ber sehr gut
9204162 selten zuvor habe ich mich auf dieser strecke derart wohl gef hlt
9204163 das team hat gro artige arbeit geleistet um mich in diese position zu bringen
9204164 auf meinem letzten reifensatz flog ich f rmlich um den kurs und lag nach dem zweiten sektor bereits 0 185 sekunden in front
9204165 im letzten sektor wurde ich daraufhin vom bulgaren blockiert der einfach irgendwo herumgefahren ist das hat mich m glicherweise eine platzierung in der ersten startreihe gekostet das w re eine feine sache gewesen wenn man das zusatzgewicht bedenkt das ich an bord habe so bin ich achter muss also im ersten rennen mit bedacht zu werke gehen um f r lauf zwei in der ersten reihe zu stehen
9204166 mein qualifying war nicht perfekt aber es lief besser als gestern
9204167 nach den nderungen des teams am heck f hlte sich das motorrad viel einfacher zu fahren an viel stabiler in den kurven dadurch kam ich im gegensatz zu gestern nicht st ndig von der linie ab trotzdem muss ich sagen dass mir die zweite reihe lieber gewesen w re
9204168 leider schaffen wir es nicht das beste aus ihnen herauszuholen dementsprechend k nnen wir uns nicht gleich stark steigern wie andere fahrer
9204169 ich bin trotzdem weiterhin optimistisch denn im freien training bte ich einige starts und ich glaube dass ich von der linie gut wegkommen werde ich will so viele positionen wie m glich gutmachen auch nach dem start aber das wird auf dieser strecke z h
9204170 das heutige qualifying ist kein ma stab f r unseren normalen leistungsstandard aber leider hatten wir auf qualifyern mehr schwierigkeiten als andere daher landeten wir im klassement etwas weiter hinten ich bin zuversichtlich denn unsere pace auf rennreifen ist viel besser als man aufgrund unserer startpositionen meinen k nnte
9204171 ich habe hier den rhythmus noch nicht ganz gefunden und deshalb auch das resultat es ist hier aufgrund der kurzen geraden und der unebenheiten auch sehr schwer auf den daten genau zu sehen ob wir eventuell sogar etwas bersehen haben am auto wir werden heute abend das eine oder andere wechseln und schauen ob es morgen ein bisschen besser geht aber gut es ist keine leichte strecke ich bin zum ersten mal hier und es liegt mir scheinbar nicht ganz so schauen wir mal morgen
9204172 jeder stand sich da irgendwie im weg aber das ist bei so vielen autos auf einer so kurzen strecke wohl normal und das hin und her mit den flaggen war nat rlich auch nicht so toll
9204173 das hin und her mit den flaggen war nat rlich auch nicht so toll
9204174 konzentration ist die eine sache f r das team ist es sehr schwierig und dann hast du ja auch noch das problem mit dem verkehr weil du ja nie allein bist entweder kommt einer von hinten oder einer ist vor dir du kannst die reifen nicht richtig aufw rmen die bremsen nicht richtig aufw rmen gerade auf dieser kurzen runde hier ist das extrem wichtig
9204175 gary ist nat rlich sehr erfahren er hat das maximum herausgeholt hat auch zudem eine saubere runde erwischt und hat einfach einen tollen job gemacht
9204176 man sieht was m glich war und von daher gibt es auch keine ausrede wir waren einfach zu langsam speziell ich
9204177 berholen ist ja hier sehr schwer es ist ja fast ein berholverbot von daher wird der start wichtig sein um eventuell die eine oder andere position gut zu machen ohne einen crash in der ersten kurve zu haben dann muss man schauen
9204178 drei starts habe ich gestern ge bt morgen werde ich noch einmal einen ben der start am n rburgring war zwar ganz gut aber starten ist ja in der dtm nicht so leicht und hier in der schr ge wird es sicherlich ganz interessant
9204179 das ist mir im ersten rennen aber auch schon so gegangen ich hoffe dass es halbwegs geht
9204180 wenn man hier berrundet wird dann ist das rennen eigentlich schon dahin
9204181 wenn man hier berrundet wird dann ist das rennen eigentlich schon dahin denn man wird viel zeit verlieren wenn man die leute passieren lassen muss es wird sehr schwierig
9204182 die chance ist ja gegeben schaden kann es sicherlich nicht da wo ich rumfahre
9204183 this was a completely unprovoked attack on a man who was simply walking along the street
9204184 we can confirm that two bodies were recovered last night from the main part of osbaston house maesbrook
9204185 the remains will be examined by a home office pathologist and post mortems are due to be carried out later today to establish the cause of death
9204186 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed
9204187 in the meantime we will keep an open mind concerning what we may or may not find
9204188 it is really exciting to see so many people turn out to welcome me ive really enjoyed the reception
9204189 everyone has been really lovely since i got back and obviously im very pleased but i dont really feel any different nothing has really changed for me
9204190 we are delighted to welcome jason as our special guest and to pay tribute to his achievements in winning both olympic gold and silver he is a great ambassador for bolton who has put bolton on the map both nationally and internationally
9204191 we hope that his triumph will inspire young people across the borough to pursue their own dreams and show them that talent combined with determination and hard work can lead to success
9204192 over the past week police and partners have been working hard to not only target the offenders that carry out this distressing crime but to raise as much awareness as possible of the tactics these criminals use to get into peoples homes
9204193 although incidents of distraction burglary have reduced significantly across greater manchester over the past few years during the summer months we do typically tend to see an increase
9204194 its important that people realise that even groups of people that are generally trusted such as the clergy council workers and charity workers should always be asked for proof of identity if you have any doubts as to their credibility dont let them in and dont be pressurised into buying anything from cold callers
9204195 both the police and trading standards have committed considerable resources to tackling the issue of doorstep crime
9204196 it is important that people report any incidents or suspicions they have about doorstep callers in their area to trading standards or the police so that appropriate action can be taken
9204197 the victim said he was struck by a car and i believe the driver targeted him and drove at him deliberately
9204198 we do not have a description of the car but there must have been people in the area at the time who may have seen something before during or after the collision
9204199 tout le monde sest r fugi chez soi ca devient vraiment vilain toute la nuit derni re il y a eu du vent mais pas comme maintenant l cest tr s fort les choses commencent tomber

9204202 we staan op het kruispunt van alle crisissen er is de economische crisis en haar gevolgen als we bij die angst een democratische angst bijtellen van een democratische politiek die machteloos staat omdat ze verlamd is door de institutionele dialoog zijn we niet meer ver van de politieke chaos

9204216 de kwestie is niet te weten of we iemand regulariseren die in een kraan kruipt of wiens advocaat elke dag met de media praat het echte debat dat we nu moeten voeren is dat over de economische immigratie gaan we onze grenzen dicht houden voor bepaalde europeanen en willen we dat de polen verplicht worden om door te gaan bij ons clandestien te werken of gaan we hen eindelijk officieel toelaten waarom zetten we onze grenzen niet open voor knelpuntberoepen en waarom kunnen we de mensen die al in ons land zijn en in die sectoren werken niet laten blijven
9204217 we moeten een oplossing vinden over een methode voor een inter institutionele dialoog waarin alle machtsniveaus in gelijke mate zijn betrokken brussel is daarbij een volwaardig gewest en geen onder gewest ook het federale niveau moet betrokken worden het niveau waar de hervormingen gestemd worden
9204218 de pro ceed viel heel goed mee het is een leuk model met een frisse uitstraling en ik vond het tof dat ik uitgerekend een compleet zwarte uitvoering meekreeg dat gaf deze auto meteen een stoere sportieve look
9204219 mijn voorganger moet erg klein geweest zijn want ik moest de stoel een heel eind naar achteren schuiven om goed te zitten maar hoofd en beenruimte waren uitstekend je moet weten dat ik 1 98 m groot ben de kofferruimte was zeker voor mij als man alleen ruim voldoende er is ook nagedacht over het zicht rondom de relatief grote spiegels helpen daar natuurlijk bij
9204220 ik heb zelf een tijdje een driedeurs gehad en die fout zou ik niet meer maken vijf deuren zijn zoveel handiger om iets in te laden of op de achterbank te leggen voor de achterbankzitters is het ook veel makkelijker om in en uit te stappen het interieur vond ik best mooi en overzichtelijk de instrumenten lieten zich vlot bedienen
9204221 wat ik wel jammer vond was de materiaalkeuze van sommige elementen de bekleding van het instrumentenbord en de deuren leek me een beetje goedkoop en niet echt krasbestendig dat kon je nu al zien en de wagen was nog zo nieuw wat ik grif toegeef is dat de muziekinstallatie een stuk beter was dan de mijne
9204222 de pro ceed reed goed maar in tweede versnelling leek hij wat terughoudend boven de 120 km uur was het aangenaam rijden op het verbruik heb ik niet gelet maar dorstig zal hij wel niet geweest zijn er was maar een kwartje uit de tank na mijn testweekend en ik heb er toch echt wel flink mee rondgereden
9204223 veel snufjes zaten er niet op maar wat me vooral bijblijft is het gebruiksgemak van deze auto de wendbaarheid en het zicht rondom parkeren was spotgemakkelijk met dit model ik heb veel bekijks gehad en toffe reacties gekregen van diverse mensen en diverse leeftijden zelfs mijn moeder zag dit autootje wel zitten
9204224 now into americas trivialzing presidential campaign a pesky event has intruded a european war russian tanks heavy artillery strategic bombers ballistic missiles abd a naval blockcade batter a european nation we are not past such things after all the end of history will be postponed again clinging to the obama campaigns talking points like a drunk to a lamppost bill richardson said this crisis proves the wisdom of obamas zest for diplomacy and that america should get the u n security council to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint apparently richardson was ambassador to the u n for 19 months without noticing that russia has a security council veto the crisis illustrates redundantly the paralysis of the un regarding major powers hence regarding major events and the fictitiousness of the european union regarding foreign policy putin has abruptly pulled the presidential campaign up from preoccupation with plumbing the shallows of john edwards and wondering what catharsis is owed to the disappointed clintons if georgia were in nato would nato now be at war with russia
9204225 meanwhile u s secretary of state condoleeza rice will attend an emergency session of nato in brussels on tuesday to fashion a more detailed response to russias actions in georgia and the disputed territories of south ossetia and abkhazia the damage done to russias reputation and the damage to peoples views of russias suitability for some of these institutions that damage cant be undone ms rice said sunday on cbs televisions face the nation
9204226 five months ago president mikheil saakashvili of georgia long a darling of this citys diplomatic dinner party circuit came to town to push for america to muscle his tiny country of 4 million into nato at the white house president bush promised him to push hard for georgias acceptance into nato the russian president warned that the push to offer ukraine and georgia membership in nato was crossing russias red lines according to an adminstration official close to the talks the story of how a 16 year low grade conflict over who should rule two small mountain regions in the caucasus erupted into the most serious post cold war showdown between the us and russia is one of miscalculation missed signals and overreaching according to interviews with diplomats and senior officials in the us the european union russia and georgia in many cases the officials would speak only on condition of anonymity
9204227 us secretary of state condoleeza rice is supposedly a specialist on russia yet one would not know that by looking at her triumphal statement that nato will defeat russian aims in georgia nato is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship said a statement of the 26 member alliance short of destabilizing europe there is practically nothing the us can do about georgia except fire more verbal volleys as rice has been doing relentlessly since the outbreak of russia georgia hostilities on august 7 8 there are four interrelated causes of the present crisis irredentism in georgia natos expansion the uss plan to station an anti missile system in eastern europe considered a first strike capability by moscow and the geo economics of energy security on the uss part instead of applying the arithmetic of political realism and coming to terms with the sources of russian anger that is at natos unwelcome intrusive and threatening expansion near russian territory the us is now seeking to augment russias insecurity by pushing more aggressively for natos role and influence in the region and beyond such bellicose us reactions are neither fully in sync with europes needs and interests nor that of the uss own interest such as engaging russia in the nato russia council whereas moscows legitimate national security worries have been completely side stepped and ignored in washington and to a lesser extent in london other western leaders such as those in paris and berlin have been more cautious and one may even say considerate of the russian point of view it is simply not wise to corner the russian bear and provoke it into aggression by taking blatant initiatives that threaten russian national security interests
9204228 war doesnt change anything how many times have we heard the claim from self righteous leftists protected by their betters condoleeza rice flew to brussels to huff and puff but nato isnt about to blow putins house down well get an earnest statement of concern the cancellation of military exercises with the russians and an easy to retract suggestion that just maybe if the astrologers approve unanimously there might be a place in the atlantic alliance for georgia and the ukraine in the distant future in an act of breathtaking daring nato ministers even put down their teacups and agreed to term the russian invasion disproportionate boy putins scared now war doesnt change anything wish it were true but war has been humankinds preferred means of effecting change were all right and left getting an in your face lesson about how the world really works passive resistance only has a chance when your opponent believes in the rule of law and respect for human rights gandhi was effective against law abiding britain but he wouldve frozen to death in the soviet gulag if hed lived long enough to reach the camps but war does work berkeley radicals dont take midnight strolls through the toughest streets in oakland they know that some human beings are innately violent but admitting it would be unbearable the bitter truth is none of us can move russia putin believes in force imagine a president barack obama pitted against putin the lefts new messiah would be gobbled up in one bite
9204229 the international community has not done enough to push back the fact is putin and his associates in the kremlin dont accept the post soviet realities but the west and particularly the u s should continue to mobilize the international community to condemn russias behavior but russia must be made to understand that it is in danger of becoming ostracized internationally if the issue of georgias territorial integrity is not adequately reasolved the u s should contemplate withdrawing from the 2o14 winter games to be held in the russian city of sochi
9204230 as israel was provoked in 1967 so too was russia provoked if we proceed on a course of isolating russia from the west keeping her out of the wto throwing her out of the g 8 and ending cooperation with nato where do we think russia will go where did il duce go when he was excommunicated from the west does the stanford provost have any idea where the end of this road lies upon which she and bush have started the us if the us intends to bring georgia and ukraine into nato and arm them to fight russia why should russia not dissolve the treaty on conventional forces in europe and move her tank armies into belarus and up to the borders of estonia latvia and lithuania in march 1939 britain pledged to declare war and fight germany to the death to guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of poland how did that one turn out for britain and poland before we start down the road of isolating and encircling russia with weak nato allies let us think through gen petreus question in 2003 about iraq tell me how does this thing end but then these folks never seem to think anything through
9204231 political power grows out of the barrel of a gun
9204232 the united nations has called on fiji to get tough on firms recruiting mercenaries in the south pacific country in a statement on friday a un working group called on fiji to create laws to tackle the problem of mercenaries and to sign on to the 1989 international convention against the recruitment use financing and training of mercenaries the working group notes with concern that in a number of instances the activities carried out by fijians abroad may qualify as mercenary related activities the un group said in 2005 fiji mercenaries were found working on the papua new guinea autonomous island province of bougainville where they were reportedly training the private army of a notorious conman the un said people in fiji also had been recruited by dubious private security firms to undertake work in iraq
9204233 the fijian military had been serving in many conflict zones as a un peacekeeping force
9204234 but some of its active or retired members were contracted directly by the uk or the us governments
9204235 the fijian military actually expanded through un peacekeeping operations in lebanon in 1978 the un invited fiji to join the united nations interim force in lebanon unifil under the british fijians had served in many parts of the world including malaya our soldiers are known for their excellence they are trained locally but also in australia new zealand the us and the uk fijian military and the us military are very close we used to have excellent relations since the 2006 coup the us has frozen all new cooperation although existing projects can still go on one more important issue to mention is that the us security companies often directly contract retired fijian soldiers who then serve in iraq afghanistan and elsewhere for fiji it is tremendous business
9204236 private armies became a viable commercial enterprise the moment america invaded iraq the time is right and our price is right
9204237 we made a conscious decision to create an army bigger than we need to generate foreign currency our economy has no choice but to build armies and its a good business there are few other foreign investments if we didnt do this our people would be in the street creating havoc
9204238 we need money and frankly we dont care what our soldiers are doing abroad killing others being involved in bad causes its not our problem sorry for being so blunt but thats how we feel here
9204239 eventually soldiers threw me on the floor and began jumping on my stomach since the coup i have been receiving anonymous phone calls some of them openly threatening members of our organization with rape
9204240 yes there is definitely fear people are suddenly scared to speak out to make a comment and be overheard by a passer by the military managed to plant small tiny seeds of fear in our society and then there is reason for real fear as some people are truly suffering like those who were taken in dragged to the military barracks
9204241 military coup is always bad news but the recent one in fiji was at least not racially motivated on the contrary leaders of the coup including commodore bainimarama called for equality for the two main ethnic groups living on these isles native fijians and indo fijians this may be the only and the last chance for national reconciliation in fiji
9204242 the united states and australia and australia is nothing else than the right hand of the united states in this part of the world are putting great pressure on the interim military government sanctions are being imposed sanctions that are harming simple people not the elites not the military in the meantime the military the very same military that performed 4 coups in the last two decades is allowed even encouraged to serve in the us and uk controlled areas in the middle east and afghanistan
9204243 the fijian army had been created by the uk after the second world war
9204244 it is simply a mercenary force that was designed to be engaged in conflicts triggered by the us and uk while allowing native fijians to make money i say native fijians because it almost exclusively consists of native fijians indians were not invited to join after they sent the crown to hell during world war ii today in iraq and afghanistan fijian soldier mercenaries are known as the toughest guards around
9204245 the biggest hurdle is just getting over the fact that you were out a little bit because of stuff going on in your shoulder
9204246 you just have to be smart about your body and how it feels

9204248 thats the way you have to manage now if you did this in april and may you may run the risk of burning people out
9204249 but they have not been overworked theyve been good for us
9204250 obviously well see how he feels tomorrow and well discuss it

9204384 posso estar sendo saudosista mas a m sica ficou t o forte como um elemento de entretenimento que est perdendo seu car ter art stico lembro que eu ia nos shows e queria ouvir um monte de m sicas novas se hoje voc faz um show com sete m sicas do disco novo pode ter certeza que em algum momento o p blico vai perder o foco
9204385 um pouco frustrante isso porque o artista quer mostrar um coisa nova mas quando vem algo que as pessoas n o conhecem j sai aquele pessoal pro lado pegar uma cerveja ou ent o ir no banheiro
9204386 as pessoas nem se d o a esse tempo para avaliar
9204387 n o sei por que ainda estamos gravando discos j que ningu m mais compra eu acho gratificante e edificante ir em uma livraria ou em uma loja de discos e escolher um disco ou livro que voc vai ficar curtindo durante o fim de semana

9204398 quando ele me viu pela primeira vez nem me achou t o parecida com a m e dele
9204399 quando voc vai trabalhando a energia da pessoa fica cada vez mais parecida com ela assim como a maysa faz com suas can es tamb m me sinto transbordando nesse trabalho
9204400 ela vai ser a mistura disso tudo uma homenagem para ela n o tenho a inten o de imit la
9204401 tudo tem sido muito dif cil ela era t o intensa que at interpret la acordando n o f cil
9204402 no in cio a nica coisa que eu sabia que ela cantava
9204403 ela era uma camaleoa numa poca em que as mulheres n o mudavam tanto o comprimento do cabelo
9204404 se eu quiser entrevistar a madonna eu entrevisto ela da mesma gravadora que eu n o vai custar muito
9204405 se juntar o meu carisma com o conhecimento musical que eu tenho o programa vai ser um sucesso me diga o que a claudete troiano do sbt tem de bom para apresentar o que ana hickmann ou edu guedes record t m nada
9204406 se deus me desse a oportunidade de voltar no tempo eu mudaria quase tudo eu era muito ing nuo
9204407 eu estou comprando a casa para ela vai ser dela do jeito que ela quiser

9204424 mesmo assim tive a sorte de fazer trabalhos que adorei e de conhecer pessoas que s o grandes amigos at hoje
9204425 outro dia uma delas me chamou para dizer bem de perto que s via a novela por causa de mim
9204426 a eu te digo o assunto que voc vai tratar comigo
9204427 eram baladas rom nticas e salsas in ditas n o tenho medo do trash

9204429 apesar do lado cafona escuto esse cd hoje e sinto orgulho pois foi um trabalho sobre humano
9204430 um psicanalista me ajudou a compor esse papel ele era louco homossexual se vestia de mulher por qu busquei essa ajuda para seguir uma linha mais precisa
9204431 das ist nat rlich alles andere als eine gute ausgangsposition bei meinem heimspiel aber ich habe mich in der vergangenheit schon von noch weiter hinten vorarbeiten k nnen mein ziel ist mindestens auf platz acht vorzufahren
9204432 this one time the agent asked me where i saw myself in five years dead i said i see myself dead and rotting or ashes i can see myself burned to ashes i remember i had a loaded gun in my pocket just the two of us were standing in the back of a crowded dark auditorium i see myself dead and in hell i remember i was planning to kill myself that night it was the night of my first big public appearance i told the agent i figured id spend my first thousand years in hell in some entry level position but after that i wanted to move into management be a real team player hell is going to see enormous growth in market share over the next millennium and i wanted to ride the crest the agent said that sounded pretty realistic
9204433 what makes notre dame different is that at notre dame you expect to win every game every year
9204434 so what ohio state michigan florida lsu usc and the like dont expect to win every game is that what you are saying
9204435 ich habe die entscheidung getroffen er steht unter druck von seinem umfeld und ist nicht in der lage zu spielen

9204443 non penso che qualcuno abbia mai fatto una cosa del genere ha detto il wide receiver al sito ufficiale dei bengals perch mi sono cambiato il cognome semplice mi diverto
9204444 una scelta fatta da un ragazzo che ha deciso di lasciare il basket professionistico ha spiegato ma che ha ancora la voglia di continuare a divertirsi grazie alla pallacanestro cosa c di strano
9204445 tornare a giocare davanti a 50 persone come se fossero ventimila non cambia nulla
9204446 quella con la squadra di reja sar una partita difficile ma noi siamo pronti e in condizione di vincere
9204447 il ricordo e soprattutto lesempio che ha dato franco sensi a questa citt a questa societ e al calcio in generale dice spalletti ci accompagner sempre e sar un valore aggiunto da portare in campo nel confronto con gli avversari bisogna vincere le partite come abbiamo fatto negli anni precedenti e non vivacchiare sotto laspetto mentale dobbiamo essere gi pronti prima di partire
9204448 quella col napoli sar una partita difficile ma noi siamo pronti e in condizione di vincere
9204449 mi farebbe piacere cos come noi cerchiamo di vincere attraverso lo spettacolo che gli sportivi fossero compatti con noi per un messaggio che pu esserci daiuto per vincere le partite
9204450 soddisfatto perch si lavorato per le possibilit che abbiamo stato un mercato importante e corretto ma c chi ha fatto meglio
9204451 ha centrato 3 4 calciatori interessanti messi su una mentalit e una struttura importante
9204452 chiaro che ci sono delle cose che bisogna prendere per quelle che sono le possibilit e le prospettive a volte non puoi prendere la persona precisa come successo con mutu che venuto meno ma siamo stati molto contenti che ci sia capitato baptista
9204453 siamo comunque in grado di opporre una forza compatta e completa ai colossi che incontreremo in campionato e in champions
9204454 qualcuno potrebbe chiedere di andare a giocare con maggiore continuit il sostituto di taddei siamo nelle condizioni di sistemare gli undici in maniera corretta per dargli un valore importante poi entrando nello specifico si pu trovare qualcosa di migliorabile da a qui a luned ci sta tutto perch pu venire fuori loccasione che qualsiasi societ sar pronta a cogliere
9204455 la formazione non lho ancora fatta magari chi anticipa troppo rischia poi di commettere qualche errore

9204457 rino ha avuto un problema nel corso dellamichevole con la nazionale nel corso di questa settimana si allenato ma non ancora al 100 risponder alla convocazione dellitalia che sar impegnata per le qualificazioni per i mondiali 2010 ma non sar a disposizione per il bologna
9204458 tutti quelli che lavorano per il milan devono pensare che si deve vincere lo scudetto non siamo certo contenti se arriviamo secondi io sono carico non vedo lora di cominciare
9204459 abbiamo rinforzato tutti i reparti e per questo siamo competitivi durante la preparazione ci sono mancati tutti gli attaccanti abbiamo lavorato soprattutto sulla difesa domani non mi aspetto un milan che possa giocare a briglia sciolta perch non ci sono ancora tutti gli automatismi in campo andr comunque una squadra molto aggressiva
9204460 abbiamo 7 attaccanti la gestione non sar semplice perch qualcuno dovr sempre restare fuori confido molto nelle qualit dei giocatori se dovessi fare tutto da solo sarebbe un problema sar una gestione possibile perch ci sar la complicit dei giocatori
9204461 lui dice il tecnico deve capire come gioca la squadra ci sono normali step di inserimento ancora non c laffiatamento che ci sar tra 2 3 mesi c tanta attesa attorno a lui
9204462 non sono mai stato trattato come un principe come sapete ho avuto problemi anche qui al milan li ho superati con il lavoro e i sacrifici spiega lattaccante ucraino io auguro a mourinho di far bene come ha sempre fatto in tutte le squadre che ha allenato ora sono molto contento di essere tornato a casa adesso la cosa pi importante per me tornare a giocare ne ho una gran voglia
9204463 so che sar difficile ma ho scelto con il cuore non mi vedevo con nessun altra maglia in italia con tutto il rispetto per le altre squadre lo so che sar dura riconquistare i tifosi ma far di tutto per farcela
9204464 sono molto contento di essere qui mi stata data una grande opportunit spiega lex difensore dellarsenal e adesso voglio dimostrare in campo di meritarmela arrivo da una grande squadra come larsenal ma il milan credo sia la pi grande
9204465 possiamo sperare di vederlo in campo nel corso dellamichevole che il milan giocher a lugano il 10 settembre
9204466 ricky ha fatto dei progressi incredibili ha spiegato il medico manara e lidea quella che la prossima settimana possa rientrare a lavorare con la squadra non risponder alla convocazione in nazionale per poter proseguire la preparazione
9204467 ho deciso di operarmi commenta dallargentina manu ginobili la verit che la mia caviglia nelle stesse condizioni di due mesi fa non peggiorata ma non nemmeno migliorata per cui lintervento lunica soluzione
9204468 questa stagione ho fatto qualche errore ma altre volte non li ho fatti
9204469 qualche problema con gomme da gara lui andr veloce subito
9204470 aspettatevi il mio impegno massimo al 100 ha detto dopo la pole ho fatto qualche errore in questa stagione ma tante altre volte non ne ho commessi
9204471 sono contento del secondo posto ha detto ma qualcosa ancora non va per questo spero di trovare qualche soluzione nel warm up le cose sono andate bene con le gomme da qualifica innvece con quelle da gara abbiamo ancora qualche problema che non abbiamo risolto al 100 anche se nellultimo run non sono andate male per dobbiamo migliorare ho provato diverse configurazioni di setting speriamo di fare un passettino in pi per stare vicini a stoner ma sono contento del secondo posto in frenata faccio fatica a fermare la moto e poi la pista che a dir la verit non mi piace moltissimo devo capirla ho provato a spingere forte ho messo dietro lorenzo ma ci manca qualche decimo con le gomme da gara la tattica stoner spinger molto fin da subito lui parte sempre bene vedremo domani
9204472 ho fatto fatica con le gomme da qualifica ha detto limolese della suzuki penso non sia il massimo partire dietro per penso positivo credo che potr fare una buona gara
9204473 la nuova ciclistica sicuramente meglio ha detto mentre per il motore speriamo di provarlo a motegi il nuovo telaio va bene ma c ancora qualcosa fare
9204474 dopo lallenamento ha raccontato lo spione molti giocatori lamentavano giramenti di testa e nausea e malgrado siano stati insieme quattro giorni davvero incredibile quanto poco abbiano mangiato molti di loro erano abituati a fare scorta di carboidrati per stare su mentre adesso tutto quello che viene permesso loro di mangiare sono un po di cereali e dei toast ecco perch qualcuno ha cominciato a contrabbandare cioccolato e patatine in camera alle spalle di capello
9204475 i giocatori non sono ingordi ha concluso lanonimo ma non riescono a sopportare di rimanere lunghi periodi senza mangiare nulla c stata qualche lamentela ma mai diretta perch nessuno ha avuto il coraggio di affrontare apertamente capello per parlargli di questa situazione visto che lallenatore famoso per la sua intransigenza
9204476 capello mi ha chiamato ha rivelato benitez per parlarmi di gerrard e di quanto tempo sarebbe rimasto fuori a causa dellintervento gli ho spiegato che se avessimo rimandato loperazione i tempi di recupero sarebbero stati poi ancora pi lunghi e lui ha capito la cosa del resto gerrard non riusciva a giocare e stava combattendo da tempo contro questo fastidio che gli procurava molto dolore da qui la nostra decisione di operarlo

9204480 in picking an unknown untested half a term governor from alaska john mccain is following in a long line of reckless men who have rolled the dice for a beauty queen
9204481 she came off looking immature herself almost high schoolish it was conduct unbecoming a governor
9204482 governor palin was caught off guard by bob lesters reference to senate president lyda green
9204483 governor you cant say this but i will lyda green is a cancer and a b
9204484 do you have any idea of what you did to make lyda green dislike you hate you
9204485 um you know once and a while i try to figure that out but i cant figure that out
9204486 the governor called senator green to explain that she does not condone name calling in any way and apologized if there was a perception that the comment was attributed to the governor
9204487 la maglia azzurra sarebbe il massimo ma forse chiedo troppo
9204488 la mattina mi allenavo ma tranquillo e il pomeriggio lavoravo un bar tabacchi aperto nel 2003 con mio cognato roberto rossi e i risparmi di una vita e un tabacchi articoli da regalo inaugurato nellinverno 2006 sempre con mio cognato roberto e con i risparmi di una carriera finch
9204489 campionato italiano a bergamo sole caldo circuito duro con una salita poi per discesa e pianura che permettono di rientrare rientro poi attacco a pochi chilometri dal traguardo ci do dentro tutto quello che ho e aspetto che da un momento allaltro vengano a prendermi invece no ultimo chilometro ultimi 500 metri ultimi 100 ultimi 10 mi volto ce la faccio mani al cielo
9204490 nel 2007 la prima corsa stata anche lultima il laigueglia poi non mi sembrava giusto correre senza stipendio va bene la passione ma non si vive solo di quella per non mi sembrava neanche bello finirla cos per il fallimento della squadra dentro di me sentivo una vocina che continuava a dirmi va avanti va avanti
9204491 avevo in ballo qualche trattativa ma la flaminia mi ha cercato corteggiato fatto sentire importante e ho ricominciato tentando di ripagare la fiducia dunque la mattina mi allenavo ma tranquillo e il pomeriggio lavoravo e poi correvo fino al campionato italiano
9204492 la maglia tricolore ti cambia fuori e un po anche dentro dalla gente ricevi un calore che non ti aspetti riconosciuto chiamato invocato pregato di regalare un autografo o di posare per una fotografia c chi mi dice ti saluta armstrong perch della questione con lance se n parlato anche troppo ma c anche chi si ricorda delle mie due vittorie alla vuelta la prima oltrepassando il traguardo a piedi con la bicicletta tenuta fra le mani
9204493 quando sono tornato al paese le colonne fuori dal bar erano verniciate in bianco rosso e verde gli amici del bar mi hanno regalato due specchietti retrovisori di quelli che si mettono sulle bici da bambino sostengono che mi giro troppo indietro e invece cos posso puntare diritto al traguardo ma quello che pi mi ha emozionato stata la proposta dellavis
9204494 quando si comincia a correre si comincia anche a sognare e io ho sognato per quasi 30 anni io sono salito in bici da bambino per la salus di seregno recentemente al trittico lombardo cerano i bambini della salus schierati in divisa i colori identici a quelli dei miei tempi giallo blu ho fatto una foto ricordo con loro e poi sono venuti anche dei ragazzi degli ex ragazzi con cui correvo da piccolo e mi hanno portato una vecchia foto dove cero anchio
9204495 domenica c il giro del veneto una corsa affascinante arrivai terzo nel 1998 stavolta non prometto nulla se non cercare di onorare la maglia tricolore non facile quando si in giornata no si sale in macchina e si va al traguardo ma con questa maglia non si pu e se proprio non se ne pu fare a meno mi devo nascondere
9204496 mi piacerebbe conquistare dopo la maglia tricolore anche quella azzurra ma forse esagero forse chiedo troppo
9204497 il ciclismo richiede dedizione totale e non so se posso garantirla ancora credo che nessuno si sia mai ritirato dallattivit con la maglia tricolore addosso ma io sono un tipo originale per
9204498 per ho capito una cosa che il successo pericoloso se ti piomba addosso quando hai 20 o 25 anni rischia di travolgerti a meno che non si abbiano uneducazione una famiglia dei valori a 37 il successo te lo gusti fino in fondo ma rimani con i piedi per terra perch distingui al volo chi ti vuole bene da sempre da chi ti vuole bene solo da adesso e chi ti vuole bene da chi dice di volerti bene
9204499 we will not tolerate an armed presence regular or irregular on our border
9204500 eighty percent of the people in that town are farc militiamen or communist party members
9204501 if you fly over the border and look on the colombian side all you see is coca crops
9204502 while the ecuadorean side is nothing but thick jungle with cocaine labs hidden under the canopy
9204503 its no trouble for a colombian to become an ecuadorean
9204504 you can buy an ecuadorean id card for about 70 90 depending how fast you need it
9204505 lago agrio has been a center of rendezvous supply and refuge for the farc
9204506 im not taking any chances i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9204507 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9204508 if its close to us our levee system wasnt designed for that kind of storm theres a tremendous risk
9204509 saya lihat korban keadaannya mengerikan tapi anehnya retno tidak bisa melihat mungkin ini kebesaran tuhan yang mengaburkan pandangan retno
9204510 it has the capacity to take out more ferret habitat than anything weve run up against and do it in such a short order
9204511 i guess its the old risk management of having your eggs spread out among many baskets
9204512 were learning as we go we really dont know the answer to that yet
9204513 were hopeful with the dusting which is something new were doing now well be able to at least contain the extent of this plague
9204514 even with the loss of almost 10 000 acres of prairie dogs conata basin still remains the largest and most important prairie dog complex on federal lands in the great plains its worth all these efforts to save it
9204515 theres the plague and the prairie dogs and thats nature taking care of the expansion
9204516 i think we want to get along we want to be able to survive just the same as the prairie dogs want to survive we dont want to annihilate them we dont just get them under control so theyre not sick give the ferrets something healthy to eat
9204517 the main problem we face is a lack of equipment that detects explosives
9204518 the iraqi government released him and in fact they released a lot of people like him
9204519 the defendants sometimes pay a judge or bring in a witness and then they go free
9204520 they have a witness who said i was with ashraf mohammed al yas
9204521 i dont know what is going on when they captured me i was surprised
9204522 i need beaver pennsylvania i need you to stand up beside me and say now is the time to bring about change in america
9204523 i think its a myth that they have all this anger
9204524 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9204525 when you talk to old people about fireflies it is always the same
9204526 they saw so many when they were young and now they are lucky now if they see one
9204527 i know of populations that have disappeared on my farm because of development and light pollution
9204528 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights
9204529 researchers hope this would allow us to track firefly populations over many years to determine if they are remaining stable or disappearing
9204530 i feel like our way of life is being destroyed
9204531 the girls then went back with this other man to his house overnight because it was a nice safe place for them then they went to gisborne to report it the next morning
9204532 it is a sickening attack from the point of view that their own safety and wellbeing was put at risk but also because this area is regarded by tourists to be a beautiful place to come
9204533 the locals are quite concerned and appalled about this sort of act happening here
9204534 i am disappointed that it happened here whether it was a local or outsider it happened and it is disturbing
9204535 to find who is actually responsible is the mission now if its a local guy then that is a major concern for us
9204536 the girls were just parked up on the beach in the van here for a nice vacation its horrible what has happened we dont want things like this to happen to visitors
9204537 when you think of the mafia you think gangster movies you dont think about the trade in animal parts or fisheries or sharks
9204538 you dont think its a billion dollar industry and its controlled by organised crime its a crazy industry and its testament to whats going on on this planet
9204539 weve built an economy and industry all based upon the destruction of the natural world
9204540 why destroy the one animal thats actually lived in balance with the world for 400 million years especially when were trying to figure out how were going to survive
9204541 while they may not want his montgomerys inept call to be part of history its slightly dishonest to edit it out
9204542 in many ways it shows his lack of confidence in calling the final moments of what was a very important race
9204543 if theyre prepared to do that over this fairly minor thing where will they stop
9204544 theyve erased an olympic moment and its sad that they felt the need to do that
9204545 everyone knows that in the few seconds of confusion before the scoreboard showed the result peter montgomery initially miscalled the race so there was no intention to hide that
9204546 however on a race of this significance it was felt that repeating the error on the audio track would detract from the athletes achievement and that the focus would be on the mistake in the commentary rather than where it should be which was on the win
9204547 i am confident mr peters will be cleared very quickly over these matters
9204548 the serious fraud office dont flippantly engage in an investigation against a minister of the crown a couple of months out from an election
9204549 we saw a party and thought it was unusual because it was in the morning
9204550 i went out to check the mail and there were people on the roof and dancing inside i could hear loud music and saw people standing on the roof it was 10 or 11 in the morning and i thought well theyve been going all night
9204551 i just thought maybe they had collapsed drinking or something i thought oh god i hope they havent fallen off the roof
9204552 basically under the building code a completed works has got to have a fence of a requisite size on it theres no two ways about it

9204554 in the end where it was more twisty i couldnt keep up the speed
9204555 this is a story about the courage of beth and jeff alt who became survivors after losing beths brother mike to suicide they were determined like many of the 180 000 who lose a loved one to suicide each other to do what they could to help other families learn about depression and the terrible toll of suicide
9204556 research shows that walking and hiking are actually beneficial to people not just for the obvious reasons but for fighting depression it actually increases the antidepressant chemicals in the brain and so does being out in the sunshine and fresh air
9204557 the john muir trail is speckled with glacial lakes and wilderness that are untouched by roads and most other civilized amenities the trail wanders through deep canyons around cold blue lakes and under sunny skies it is most rugged and arguably some of the prettiest terrains

9204565 una rivisitazione in chiave metaforica del gangster movie di hong kong
9204566 la sceneggiatura cambiata pi volte in corso dopera conferma lautore dello script fernando bonassi ma il punto focale la mafia della falsificazione che opera in cina come in brasile un problema che tocca i vertici politici e i rapporti tra gli stati e che anche voi in italia conoscete bene
9204567 e vero siamo partiti dallintrigo mafioso ma poi siamo andati oltre

9204582 venezia esce a testa alta da unannata difficile per il cinema mondiale
9204583 altro che critiche dalla stampa internazionale tutti stanno scrivendo quello che noi stiamo dicendo da mesi primo a toronto per stessa ammissione del direttore i titoli migliori sono quelli che passano prima qui a venezia tutti in antemprima mondiale da demme ad aronofsky secondo c un problema oggettivo che la carenza di film degli studios provocata dallo stallo conseguente al lungo sciopero degli sceneggiatori e questo riguarda non solo venezia ma tutti i festival degli ultimi mesi
9204584 certamente venezia non perde anzi sottolinea direi che esce a testa alta da unannata molto particolare per il cinema mondiale
9204585 ma rileva il direttore dai noi si citano solo le mezze righe di polemica
9204586 il quale ricorda muller ha citato come i titoli pi forti del festival canadese 2 film the wrestler di darren aronofsky e rachel getting married di jonathan demme entrambi in prima mondiale a venezia
9204587 i film degli studios non sono pronti ce n qualcuno ma parecchi sono slittati da settembre a ottobre fino a dicembre di questi film ne abbiamo qualcuno
9204588 ci che per me era ovvio anche a cannes il fatto che ci sono meno film indipendenti di alta qualit americani e pi film in lingua straniera

9204593 i was pretty confident coming out of the last game
9204594 i had a good feeling about how things would work out
9204595 its a dream come true its always been a dream for me to play pro football but when i was in canadian college i had my eyes on the cfl but i didnt think i could get a spot on an nfl team just to be here and have a spot on the practice roster is truly amazing
9204596 the acquisition and signing of andrej is a strong statement to our players and our fans that the lightning ownership group is committed to putting the best product on the ice now and for years to come

9204610 we were genuinely outplayed by the boks on saturday and nothing will change the disappointment felt by the boys in that change room
9204611 but well put that trophy in the cabinet and start looking ahead to the next few weeks
9204612 a test loss is a test loss we are not really concerned with the numbers
9204613 i think what it showed was how little there is in a competition that includes the three best sides in the world
9204614 look at what happened in sydney where australia beat the all blacks the next week we were belted in auckland
9204615 the boks are world champions and because they are now at the bottom of the tri nations log they are not suddenly a bad side you have to give them credit for the way they played today
9204616 we achieved something by winning the trophy but we still have an opportunity to achieve something more there is a fantastic opportunity coming up in brisbane and well need to regroup
9204617 although he may be clean honest competent and honorable he cannot do it govern politics is the art of compromise and this is where he loses because he is still a priest
9204618 i have always spoken against priests running as politicians and he knows that very well he has to either give up his priesthood and so become a poor politician or give up his political role and become a full priest
9204619 according to among ed the recall movement is because of politics and jueteng i say yes in all probability but i think it has to be accepted that you cannot run a province without a party mate
9204620 i think there are some advantages to deferring but we have played in an awful lot of games where when we win the toss we take the ball and we have done well in a lot of those games as well
9204621 i dont know if there is anything to getting the ball and having first crack at it or giving it up and having that first possession in the second half
9204622 we feel that with so many levels of judgment that go into the force out call it creates a more consistent play when either you get your feet down for a complete pass or you do not

9204668 whether you are competing in sport or in life success is determined by a day in day out endless pursuit of many little things so often the difference between winning and losing is just one or a few of those little things

9204758 failed to address in light of the allegations made by binyam mohamed the abhorrence and condemnation accorded to torture cruel inhuman or degrading treatment
9204759 confirmed the concern i have had for several years that the uk is complicit in extraordinary rendition
9204760 in arriving at our final conclusions on public interest immunity and the discretion to order disclosure it will be necessary to consider whether this is a legitimate requirement
9204761 todays judgment discloses the shocking fact that the foreign secretary failed to give any proper weight in secret submissions he made to the court to the abhorrence of torture when he purported to determine that it was in the public interest not to disclose the evidence of ill treatment to our client
9204762 the foreign secretary has balanced mr mohameds right to a fair trial with the strong us desire that this information not be disclosed
9204763 rules and procedures that are transparent and rules of evidence that make sense and are fair these basic principles apply universally and without them the rule of law means little or nothing
9204764 it is quite obvious from casual observation that someone who has been known to have misled others including the countrys parliament has lost the moral authority to preach about the rule of law and good governance one wonders then what basic principles blair had in mind when he gave an almost unconditional support for the unilateral decision to invade iraq against the wishes of the international community and without the approval of the un indeed as late as april 2006 when an eminent british former law lord attacked guantanamo bay as a stain on american justice blair reportedly refused to follow suit
9204765 it is disgusting to see this criminal of the highest order being welcomed in malaysia and worse still to talk on the rule of law when he broke all international laws and the laws of his own country by deliberately lying and sending young british soldiers to die in a war of aggression
9204766 saddam has been hanged karadzic was recently arrested but this man goes around the world lecturing on the rule of law
9204767 by supporting and participating in the 2003 united states led invasion and occupation of iraq i wonder whether britain being the worlds oldest democracy still possesses moral authority in a comity of nations to lecture on the principle of rule of law

9204772 imagin bamos que suceder a esto nunca se crey en el discurso de los pol ticos nunca tuvieron en cuenta nuestras propuestas de ley
9204773 el dolor el cansancio por el viaje que realiz desde beijing y el cambio de horario son factores adversos ya que a los tres d as de haber llegado hizo un gran esfuerzo al jugar frente a arsenal
9204774 la campa a de obama es sofisticada compar ndola con la de mccain su gente puede abrir un sitio de facebook en su p gina hay cientos de voluntarios como un mill n que hacen esto todos los d as
9204775 el modo en que obama hace uso de la tecnolog a posibilita una interacci n m s personal los usuarios piensan que el candidato les habla cara a cara de hecho obama contesta personalmente mails que le env an y en los grandes actos menciona a personas del vecindario que trabajaron con l y as da la sensaci n de que son una comunidad
9204776 es el concepto wiki wikipedia de autonom a no hay peleas internas en el equipo los que apoyan a obama quieren ganar escuchan el mensaje y lo reproducen fielmente la generaci n joven participa muy activamente en el proceso de informaci n y pone art culos en su red de contactos
9204777 se puede suponer que la cibercampa a del senador dem crata apunta especialmente a votantes de cierto poder adquisitivo cuya buena conectividad les permite alimentar su afici n a los contenidos multimedia y tan familiarizados con el comercio electr nico que no vacilan en adquirir una gorra una chomba o un distintivo en el blog del candidato el tipo de persona cuyos datos es til recolectar por si a ltimo momento se necesitaran voluntarios id neos para hacer llamadas pidiendo votos o para fiscalizar la elecci n
9204778 cuando se observa el blog de obama llaman la atenci n dos cosas una que es un sitio bastante pesado en im genes y contenidos multimedia lo que lo hace complicado de apreciar por quien no tenga acceso a la banda ancha otra que tiene un evidente af n recaudatorio ya que a cada paso aparecen en forma destacada sugerencias de adquirir distintos souvenirs
9204779 las peque as donaciones vinculan a la gente con la campa a apunta mercurio por eso hay much simas donaciones
9204780 podr contratar a la mejor gente y adopta las t cticas m s eficientes pero si esos avances no van en sinton a con el candidato no sirven
9204781 yo sinceramente me fui a vivir solo me fui con mi pareja mi mam ven a a visitarme dos veces por semana a l har un a o que no lo veo mi hermano lo ven a a ver por obligaci n nada m s
9204782 por favor que no nos llame que no nos hable ni se acerque a ninguno de los dos mi hermano no lo quiere ni ver tampoco
9204783 wir haben es leider nicht geschafft alle unsere 286 personen durchzutelefonieren ob sie diesmal wieder dabei sein wollen
9204784 wir haben das nat rlich berall zur kenntnis genommen probleme gibt es dadurch keine
9204785 seither bin ich obmann gesch ftsf hrer und sekret r in einer person selbstverst ndlich ehrenamtlich und vor allem zus tzlich zu meinem herk mmlichen beruf
9204786 uns fehlt da nat rlich die organisation die andere parteien haben deshalb bleibt auch manches auf der strecke
9204787 el impulso econ mico pas de largo ante los asalariados los jubilados y los pobres
9204788 el umbral de pobreza oficial para una familia de cuatro miembros ha sido fijado en 21 203 d lares por a o la cifra de estadounidenses que viven por debajo de esa barrera de nivel de pobreza subi de 36 5 millones de personas en el 2006 a 37 3 millones en 2007

9204790 quien ame lo individual y le d especial importancia a las boutiques personales l s que llegar al placer total en dubai all encontrar la moda noble y la extravagante y una cantidad enorme de accesorios excepcionales
9204791 supongamos que t y yo y un grupo de gente sufrimos un naufragio y podemos llegar a una isla rica en toda clase de frutos por supuesto tenemos que trabajar para recoger los alimentos pero supongamos que de pronto uno de nosotros nos se ala que toda la isla le pertenece a l y que ninguno de nosotros tendr a derecho ni siquiera a un bocado sin antes pagarle a l un tributo nos quedar amos perplejos no es cierto hasta nos reir amos a carcajadas por tal est pida arrogancia pero si hubiera seguido molestando lo habr amos tirado al mar con toda justicia supongamos m s que nosotros y nuestros antepasados hubi ramos cultivado la isla y producido todo lo que necesit bamos y de pronto llega alguien y se declarara due o de todo qu le responder amos creo que ni siquiera le prestar amos atenci n le dir amos que tendr a que compartir con nosotros el trabajo para vivir all pero supongamos que l insistiera en su derecho a la propiedad y nos mostrara un papel firmado por alguien sosteniendo que todo le pertenece a l no sotros le responder amos que est loco pero si l hubiera tenido un gobierno como respaldo habr a recurrido a l para que protegiera su derecho y entonces el gobierno hubiera enviado polic as y militares que nos habr an expulsado para defender as el derecho a la propiedad y se convertir a in aeternum en el propietario legal
9204792 el proceso de otorgamiento de becas todav a no termin
9204793 la beca no es una pol tica universal es para aquellos que m s lo necesitan de esta manera la van a cobrar los que est n en situaci n de vulnerabilidad social y econ mica
9204794 no se otorgar n a aquellos estudiantes cuyos padres sean propietarios de sus casas
9204795 los chicos son sujetos de derechos pol ticos o no
9204796 puede ocurrir que la familia tenga una casa propia en un barrio carenciado o que el jefe de hogar no tenga trabajo
9204797 hay 60 000 solicitudes sobre un total de 110 alumnos
9204798 en una ciudad con 67 mil planes de ciudadan a porte a y m s de 30 mil tickets para alimentos es posible que haya esa cantidad de solicitudes
9204799 el ministro no pudo explicar cu l hab a sido el criterio para rechazar las becas que no fueron asignadas
9204800 no dijo por qu en la escuela padre mugica de la villa 31 quedaron el 50 por ciento de los chicos sin cobertura de beca
9204801 no se trata de un conflicto por razones presupuestarias sino por voluntad pol tica el ministerio tiene un presupuesto de 24 7 millones destinado a becas de los cuales s lo asign 16 3 millones de acuerdo con la resoluci n 4251 del ministerio de educaci n
9204802 todav a no termin el proceso de reconsideraci n y de ser necesario si el presupuesto no es suficiente se reasignar n partidas
9204803 no se entiende qu van a reconsiderar si no explican cu l es el criterio por el que fueron rechazados
9204804 parece que el macrismo pretende que los chicos se cuelguen un cartel que diga soy pobre para que le den una beca
9204805 mientras el gobierno de macri env a a la legislatura una ampliaci n presupuestaria de 100 millones para subsidiar a la educaci n privada no hace lo mismo para otorgar m s becas a los chicos de las escuelas p blicas
9204806 aber wir haben es eingebunden es ist nicht allzu schlimm
9204807 es wird eine art comedy dokumentation ich bereise als forscher sterreich und gestalte reiseberichte ber sitten gebr uche kultur k nstler und lokale eigenheiten diese reiseberichte werden in einem burgenl ndischen gasthaus vor live publikum pr sentiert
9204808 nat rlich bin ich etwas nerv s wenn das konzept aufgeht der pilot gut ankommt und die sendung wirklichkeit wird ist das eine spitzenchance und eine riesenplattform mich zu pr sentieren
9204809 wir haben im m rz unser erstes arbeitspapier abgegeben dass es relativ schnell so weit gediehen ist ist ein gutes zeichen hoffe ich
9204810 yo viv la violencia de tierno a la mujer le pegaba delante de los ni os
9204811 decile que la quer a felicitar por el coraje de dar su testimonio
9204812 el clima era insoportable a emilce la castigaba por cualquier cosa siempre fue un hombre violento a su hija yo la proteg a sac ndola de la casa o llev ndomela a otra habitaci n el m s chico ten a pocos meses todav a no pod a entender lo que ocurr a
9204813 ella le ten a mucho miedo a tierno cualquiera se daba cuenta
9204814 ella estaba entre los vecinos que reclamaban el alejamiento del funcionario
9204815 es un golpeador yo lo s porque lo viv de cerca
9204816 yo fui una mujer golpeada por hombres estas cosas las viv en carne propia s lo que es tener miedo tener p nico y hasta que uno no vence el medio nadie se lo saca ya no tengo miedo
9204817 los quebrantos superar n el bill n de d lares
9204818 los estadounidenses tienen que considerarse afortunados por el hecho de que los europeos fueron suficientemente tontos como para comprar los cr ditos hipotecarios basura
9204819 uno de los contextos econ micos y de pol tica monetaria m s dif ciles que se hayan visto
9204820 un bello ejemplo de privatizaci n y de apertura de un sector a la iniciativa privada con consecuencias desastrosas
9204821 de una crisis de un tipo particular de cr dito subprime la creatividad de las instituciones financieras neoliberales parece sin l mites en cuanto la ganancia est al alcance de la mano se implementan nuevos procedimientos y lo m s extraordinario en este caso es la capacidad de estas instituciones para pasarles una gran parte de los riesgos a otros agentes
9204822 bloquear el auge de los cr ditos hipotecarios y de otros ser a a corto plazo precipitar la recesi n que se anuncia en lugar de remediarla pero sobre todo ser a comprometer a m s largo plazo el mantenimiento de las tasas de crecimiento relativamente elevadas de la econom a de estados unidos
9204823 en la mundializaci n liberal el crecimiento se concentra en las dos extremidades del abanico de la riqueza entre los estados unidos y pa ses cuya mano de obra se vende a buen precio como china es un elemento central de la propaganda neoliberal imaginen una tasa de crecimiento francesa en estados unidos una perspectiva insoportable para el amo del mundo algo deber cambiar pero qu para mejor o para peor
9204824 es una medida muy distributiva as que seguramente en alg n momento como hacemos todos los a os entre agosto y octubre se adoptar
9204825 piden bajen la tablita bajen la tablita pero despu s hay que tener recursos para subir las asignaciones familiares
9204826 cada a o el gobierno anterior y el actual vienen modificando el m nimo no imponible del impuesto
9204827 cada vez hay menos trabajadores obligados a pagar el tributo
9204828 s lo el 6 por ciento de los trabajadores y de altos ingresos
9204829 f r gravierende verst e gegen die pilzschutzverordnung m ssen die schwammerlsucher mit strafen zwischen 300 und 3630 euro rechnen im wiederholungsfall sind es sogar bis zu 7260 euro
9204830 die pilzlizenz wird von uns nicht berpr ft das obliegt den grundbesitzern
9204831 se quiere volver atr s en lo que ven amos haciendo con la separaci n de la basura con el paco y la pol tica de ni ez es necesario que el gobierno de mauricio macri empiece a dar cuentas de pol ticas que brillan por su ausencia
9204832 no hay nada de eso yo estoy abocado a la ciudad y voy a mantener mi espacio pol tico con los sectores que ven amos trabajando durante mi gesti n
9204833 ayer habl bamos con el secretario de la cgt hugo moyano que me dec a que jam s se les hubiese ocurrido estar discutiendo por la famosa tablita de machinea porque nunca hubieran pensado que el salario de un trabajador pod a estar incluido en esa discusi n en el 2003 ni sab amos qu era
9204834 en aquel momento en el 2003 nadie pensaba que el salario de un trabajador pagar a ganancias y hoy estamos discutiendo sobre un peso m s o un peso menos con la cgt en ese sentido
9204835 esto habla a las claras de que vivimos en un pa s diferente porque all por el 2003 discut amos qu bamos a hacer con el 25 por ciento de trabajadores sin trabajo y hoy discutimos qu vamos a hacer con las ganancias
9204836 siempre es bueno ir por m s querer m s eso es lo que pasa en todas las sociedades y por eso me siento orgullosa de ser la presidenta de un pa s que quiere ir por m s porque el pa s creci el pa s mejor
9204837 el poder ejecutivo cumple la resoluci n parlamentaria adoptada el 28 de agosto sobre el rompimiento de relaciones con la federaci n rusa
9204838 esto no favorecer las relaciones bilaterales se al sin ese canal de comunicaci n nos ser dif cil hacer llegar nuestros respectivos puntos de vista
9204839 la raz n venza a las emociones y que los l deres europeos rechacen una evaluaci n unilateral del conflicto y caractericen objetiva e independientemente la situaci n
9204840 stop stop y stop hay que detener la escalada de lo contrario el mar negro pronto saldr de sus costas debido a la cantidad de buques de guerra extranjeros
9204841 es importante que conservemos todo lo que logramos formar en los ltimos a os en el mbito de la cooperaci n en las esferas m s diversas
9204842 wir haben f r den alten kreisky auch schon gespielt
9204843 in die besten h nde zur ck in denen sie sein kann
9204844 que los cuuuumplas feeeliz que los cuuumplas re cre aaaar que los cumplas feeeeliz
9204845 recrear sin l pez murphy es como el ari sin carri
9204846 esto no fue una interna entre gente que mea agua bendita y delincuentes
9204847 fue una interna entre los que quer an ser espectadores y los que queremos ser protagonistas
9204848 no quiero volver a estar en un partido que saque el 1 5 por ciento de los votos para todos los que dicen que recrear est muerto sta es una se al de vida
9204849 estas no son maniobras administrativas hubo un n cleo que organiz la red y se podr a estar ante un caso de asociaci n il cita uno de los delitos graves castigados por el c digo penal
9204850 esto no es un ataque al ej rcito todo lo contrario
9204851 no confundir irregularidades con delitos castigados por el c digo penal
9204852 no ser autocomplacientes con las explicaciones sobre este grave caso
9204853 con las normas administrativas y la ley nada autoriza a cometer delitos en nombre de una supuesta necesidad urgente
9204854 de los 1317 expedientes que fueron analizados por este caso 583 hab an sido manipulados con modificaciones de folio falsificaciones de firmas u otro tipo de acciones delictivas
9204855 hubo maniobras groseras que de ning n modo se pueden asimilar a irregularidades administrativas sino por el contrario a acciones delictivas
9204856 lo que no podemos hacer es actuar de manera autocomplaciente con actos de corrupci n se le han quitado recursos al estado a trav s de il citos cometidos en el ej rcito que tampoco recibe lo que necesita cuando ocurren este tipo de maniobras
9204857 separemos las cosas podemos mejorar la administraci n por razones t cnicas pero aqu pas un hecho muy grave que es delictivo y tenemos que ponernos todos al frente de la situaci n para extirpar estos procedimientos en un pa s con muchas necesidades insatisfechas en sectores populares y tambi n en la propia fuerza hay que cuidar adecuadamente los recursos
9204858 se habla asumiendo la responsabilidad pol tica para decirles cara a cara que esto es lo mejor para el ej rcito
9204859 buzzi va a ir no tenemos dudas se alaban en cambio desde la cta con duhalde no tiene nada en com n el se est dedicando a colectar por derecha con la salida de peronistas del kirchnerismo
9204860 la militancia de la federaci n va a estar y supongo que buzzi tambi n el estuvo en algunas de las convocatorias
9204861 no queremos la l gica tradicional de una mesa de referentes en donde el conjunto los siga queremos proponer un recorrido en com n m s que llegar con todo resuelto
9204862 las prioridades para que haya un avance popular en la argentina
9204863 las acciones de manera com n que pueden resolver para impulsar y sostener esas prioridades
9204864 las estrategias que se van a plantear en forma conjunta en los mbitos institucionales
9204865 jujuy es el paso final de un recorrido por las diferentes provincias en las que estamos convocando a la constituyente social para poner en marcha esa fuerza para transformar este pa s
9204866 es un encuentro para los que creemos que con lo que est no alcanza y que queremos discutir c mo se vuelve a pensar una naci n en una argentina fuertemente extranjerizada supone tambi n un debate respecto a que no hay naci n sin condiciones de igualdad y que tiene que darse una experiencia en unidad
9204867 am anfang habe ich mich von manchen alten ausgedienten lkw nicht trennen k nnen und sie behalten damals habe ich nicht daran gedacht dass ich einmal oldtimer sammeln w rde
9204868 saurer war fr her die beste sterreiche marke die k nigsklasse sozusagen
9204869 es ist manchmal unheimlich schwierig ein bestimmtes fahrzeug zu bekommen kontakte in der sammlerszene zu kn pfen ist nicht einfach f r einen oldtimersammler bin ich noch relativ jung aber wenn man erst einmal involviert ist erf hrt man vieles und lernt total interessante menschen kennen
9204870 aber so ist das eben einmal bin ich zu einem alten mann acht mal hingefahren er hat gesagt er verkauft mir den lastwagen erst wenn ich ihn starten kann
9204871 im endeffekt hat der mann den lkw dann jemandem verkauft den er zum ersten mal gesehen hat
9204872 da muss man f r sich eine finanzielle schmerzgrenze einziehen
9204873 bei uns besuchen fast alle kinder ab vier jahren den kindergarten das hat nichts mit den kosten zu tun
9204874 dass ein suspendierter osttiroler polizeiinspektionskommandant ohne gro es aufsehen und nach kurzem amtsweg rehabilitiert wurde ist sch n und gut aber in seiner verh ltnism igkeit zu einem hnlichen fall im zillertal nicht ganz nachvollziehbar und f r mich unverst ndlich
9204875 es gibt zu viele sachen die uns hier st ren
9204876 um auf einem schiff leben zu k nnen muss man eine vertrautheit aufbauen ein gef hl eine beziehung das geht nicht wenn man sich ein schiff kauft
9204877 nudeln reis und mehl werden wir immer auf dem schiff lagern genauso wie trinkwasserflaschen obst und gem se kaufen wir frisch an land
9204878 je unruhiger das wetter ist umso ruhiger muss man auf dem schiff werden es darf keine hektik entstehen positives und vern nftiges denken ist die hauptsache
9204879 wir sollten alle stolz auf die historische nominierung von gouverneurin sarah palin sein
9204880 aber der debatte wird durch gouverneurin palin eine wichtige neue stimme hinzugef gt
9204881 hoteldirektor oder eine gehobene position in einem drei sterne restaurant
9204882 vor allem muss man authentisch sein und darf den leuten nichts vorspielen
9204883 los piquetes en las rutas y los cercos que se hac an a las cementeras desviaron los insumos y perjudic a la actividad
9204884 mejor que analizar la actividad midiendo las ventas es bucear en los permisos de construcci n ya que los n meros actuales corresponden a decisiones de uno dos y hasta tres a os atr s
9204885 esto nos alerta de lo que hay que esperar en el futuro
9204886 sollte die sicherheit der kinder nicht mehr gew hrleistet sein
9204887 weil wir weniger sch ler haben wurde uns ein geringeres stundenkontingent zugewiesen
9204888 so wie es aussieht verlieren wir im osten des bezirks noch eine klasse
9204889 im volksschulbereich versuchen wir dass es sich dabei um maximal zwei schulen handelt
9204890 wir sind was schulen betrifft ein sehr kleinstrukturierter bezirk flexibilit t ist daher gefordert
9204891 wir haben den tiefstand noch nicht erreicht vor allem nicht im volksschulbereich
9204892 para preservar la paz social y no poner en riesgo a los usuarios
9204893 defender los intereses de los partidos de izquierda y no de los trabajadores
9204894 atento a que la naturaleza de la convocatoria demanda de esta autoridad administrativa extremar las medidas de control asociacional coordinando la fiscalizaci n suficiente lo que se dificulta por la inminencia de su celebraci n la direcci n nacional dispone suspender provisoriamente la realizaci n del congreso extraordinario
9204895 el ministerio no tiene inspectores para supervisar el desarrollo del congreso
9204896 el problema real existe es un conflicto interno en el sindicato y vamos a tratar de que se resuelva por la v a de los reclamos administrativos o judiciales y no por las v as de hecho
9204897 la huelga es un da o por definici n pero cuando el usuario es el conjunto de la poblaci n nos exige el doble de atenci n preocupaci n y de atenci n sobre el tema
9204898 bauernbund und mitglieder der landjugend haben dann eine vorauswahl getroffen und die models wurden zur probe fotografiert
9204899 ich empfehle dass man sich den heurigen kalender schon bei der pr sentation besorgt
9204900 estamos satisfechos por el veredicto es la sentencia que hab amos buscado el presidente del tribunal manej el debate de la mejor manera garantizando el debido proceso y el principio de contradicci n de acuerdo con lo que prev la constituci n
9204901 despu s de 32 a os hemos logrado que en tucum n se acabe la impunidad para los dictadores que han cometido los peores delitos de la historia argentina
9204902 pretendemos que cumpla la condena donde su salud se lo permita sin que ello implique que goce de privilegios que no goza ning n otro condenado en la argentina
9204903 ich habe geh rt ballack ballack tor f r deutschland ein paar minuten sp ter klingelte das telefon
9204904 die werden nicht anrufen um mich zu fragen wie es mir geht ich soll f nfmal hintereinander wahnsinn gesagt haben
9204905 das stummsein hat unsere mutter in die familie hineingebracht so ist meine sehnsucht nach sprache entstanden
9204906 meine gelddiebst hle d rften ihn so zwei bis drei ochsen gekostet haben
9204907 wenn ich nicht im eigenen haushalt ein kriminelles kind gewesen w re was w re aus mir geworden
9204908 ich betrete fast nie eine evangelische kirche die meisten kommen mir ja wie waschk chen vor
9204909 ahora hay que pensar en la estrategia procesal y la mejor t ctica de investigaci n es unificar las causas por centro clandestino de detenci n
9204910 kein medium in sterreich hat die gr e und toleranz gehabt auch den gegnern des eu vertrags eine stimme zu geben
9204911 die sollen nicht die steine auf den lter gewordenen herausgeber werfen
9204912 ich glaube dass wir sagen k nnen der 28 september ist eine zeit der abrechnung wahltag ist zahltag
9204913 wir schauen schon drauf dass wir nicht die falschen mit staatsb rgerschaften ausstatten
9204914 der vfgh ist nicht gesetzgeber das letzte wort hat das volk und das letzte wort hat der w hler in einer demokratie
9204915 of course we are concerned about the fans however any disappointment from the core fans should not be directed toward fox
9204916 what we are doing is seeking to enforce our distribution rights to watchmen legal copyright ownership should not just be swept under the rug and ignored
9204917 the non disclosure agreement i signed prevents me from saying much but i can spout the following with complete joygasmic enthusiasm snyder and co have pulled it off remember that feeling of watching sin city on the big screen and being blown away by what a faithful translation of the source material it was in terms of both content and visuals triple that and youll come close to watching watchmen even alan moore might be surprised at how close the movie is to the book march cant come soon enough
9204918 although we will miss scholes for the first champions league game michael carrick will hopefully be fit by that time
9204919 it creates that little bit of spice because i am coming back to glasgow but looking at the overall group we should be okay in terms of qualifying we can progress
9204920 i thought tevez was the outstanding player on the pitch
9204921 we had the best chances throughout the match it was an open game and both teams did very well
9204922 weve put a 7million bid on the table to manchester united
9204923 the complexities of their situation are that it depends on them getting one in that one might well be bulgarian berbatov
9204924 if they do bring someone in i want to be at the front of the queue and i will do whatever it takes to bring campbell to the football club
9204925 there will be a lot of people alluding to the fact weve got carried away with ourselves but i can absolutely guarantee that im here for the long term building the football club
9204926 mich freuts dass wir so ein spiel hingelegt haben es war nicht alles gold was gl nzt aber ich bin zufrieden
9204927 nach meiner verletzung konnte man nicht damit rechnen das war ein ganz hartes st ck arbeit
9204928 ich habe dadurch viel zeit verloren 30 sekunden hat das bestimmt gekostet
9204929 providing this information would be a first step towards accountability for the uks involvement in the us programme of rendition and secret detention and in the torture and other ill treatment of terrorist suspects
9204930 statements that binyam mohamed made in the course of his unlawful detention will form the basis of charges against him if he is tried before a military commission at guant namo bay a trial which would be unfair and could involve charges which could be punishable by death any information which the uk authorities have which relates to violations of his human rights or could help binyam mohameds defence should be disclosed to his lawyers without any further delay
9204931 secrecy with the excuse of protecting diplomatic relations can no longer be used to justify the failure to investigate the involvement of uk agents in human rights violations
9204932 with any shred of self respect will be vigilant to ensure that it does not take part in this criminal savagery
9204933 we hardly needed evidence although there is more than enough that gitmo was going to be a torture chamber
9204934 professor chomsky is right to borrow from president clinton the world is much more impressed by the power of americas example than the example of american power likewise the world is more impressed by british principle than the pretense of britains special relationship a true friend to american would not stand by while president bush squanders americas birthright
9204935 the uk governments reaction to the us programme of rendition a policy of kidnapping people and taking them to places where they may be tortured has been inadequate to say the least it is scarcely credible that now despite all we know about rendition and the uks involvement in it the british government still refuses to condemn this illegal immoral and counterproductive policy
9204936 as an atlanticist i believe that a strong transatlantic alliance is an essential part of combating dangerous extremism but this does not mean turning a blind eye or as the high court recently found in the case of binyam mohamed facilitating americas deeply damaging rendition programme we cannot afford to undermine the values we are seeking to export the uk must use its influence to convince the united states that rendition does precisely this
9204937 i think perhaps chomsky has been looking in the wrong place the mail on sunday and i have certainly been trenchant in our criticism of some this the war in iraq and guantanamo for example we were one of the first to run pictures of the orange jumpsuits alongside stories about guantanamo
9204938 in some respects there has been a failure of the modern left where traditional leftwing writers have been supporting the war on terror as some sort of liberal crusade that is partly because of the labour government which made the left believe they have had friends in office chomsky needs to look in other places if he wants to find voices of criticism
9204939 the region was taken by a treaty that cuba was forced to sign under military occupation
9204940 the proper and natural extension of classical liberalism into the era of advanced industrial society
9204941 that he may make them taste a bit of that which they have done in order that they may return
9204942 and be afraid of the duaa of an oppressed person because there is no veil between him and allah
9204943 no brother the fifty pounds is sadaqah the food is incidental it will grant you admission bidhnillah to benefits that you have not yet realised and which if you knew you had missed you would regret for years to come
9204944 a muslim is a brother of another muslim he neither wrongs him nor forsakes him
9204945 feed the hungry visit the sick and free the prisoner
9204946 did not consider it necessary to form any view about the overall fairness of the military commissions procedure
9204947 the uk is under no obligation under international law to assist foreign courts and tribunals in assuring that torture evidence is not admitted
9204948 it is hm governments position that evidence held by the uk government that us and moroccan authorities engaged in torture or rendition cannot be obtained
9204949 a serious potential threat to the security of the united kingdom
9204950 every reason to seek to obtain as much intelligence from him as was possible in accordance with the rule of law and to cooperate as fully as possible with the united states authorities to that end
9204951 would not help him unless he cooperated fully with the us authorities
9204952 was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer
9204953 provided further information to the united states and further questions to be asked of bm binyam
9204954 was still incommunicado and they must also have appreciated that he was not in a united states facility and that the facility in which he was being detained was that of a foreign government other than afghanistan
9204955 sought to be used as a confession in a trial where the charges are very serious and may carry the death penalty
9204956 a long standing principle of the common law that confessions obtained by torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used as evidence in any trial
9204957 by seeking to interview bm in the circumstances found and supplying information and questions for his interviews the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities went far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
9204958 after the commencement of this application but before the hearing
9204959 identified documents which he considers could be considered exculpatory or might otherwise be relevant in the context of the proceedings before the military commission
9204960 it is a matter of regret that the documents have not been made available in the proceedings under the military commissions act in confidence to bms lawyers who have security clearance from the united states authorities to at least secret level
9204961 he was subject to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment by or on behalf of the united states
9204962 subject to torture during such detention by or on behalf of the united states
9204963 had an opportunity to consider the interests of national security in the light of these judgments
9204964 likely to result in serious damage to us national security and could harm existing intelligence information sharing arrangements between our two governments
9204965 subject only to the condition that the names of american and british government officials and the locations of intelligence facilities will be redacted from the documents prior to their being provided
9204966 ordering the disclosure of us intelligence information now would have only the marginal effects of serious and lasting damage to the us uk intelligence sharing relationship and thus the national security of the united kingdom and of aggressive and unprecedented intervention in the apparently functioning adjudicatory processes of a longtime ally of the united kingdom in contravention of well established principles of international comity
9204967 failed to address in the light of allegations made by bm the abhorrence and condemnation accorded to torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment
9204968 nevertheless contended that the issues arising out of bms allegations of torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment were implicitly dealt with in his certificate
9204969 we do not consider that the issue arising out of the allegations made by bm is implicitly dealt with in these documents
9204970 gone to very considerable lengths to provide bm with assistance
9204971 been engaged in lengthy discussions which have led to the important changes
9204972 has been time consuming and burdensome and has rendered very real assistance to the interests of justice in this case
9204973 recently informed the attorney general and the minister for home affairs that dr haneef is no longer a person of interest
9204974 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved
9204975 psychologists strive to benefit those with whom they work and take care to do no harm
9204976 unless they are working directly for the persons being detained or for an independent third party working to protect human rights
9204977 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9204978 this seems like a final push by the administration before they go out the door
9204979 we have been at war with an unconventional enemy whose primary goal is to kill innocent americans
9204980 is trying to stir up again the politics of fear by reminding people of something they havent really forgotten that we are engaged in serious armed conflict with al qaeda
9204981 but the question is where is that conflict to be waged and by what means
9204982 as sept 11 2001 recedes into the past there are some people who have come to think of it as kind of a singular event and of there being nothing else out there
9204983 in a way we are the victims of our own success our own success being that another attack has been prevented
9204984 reaffirm that for the duration of the conflict the united states may detain as enemy combatants those who have engaged in hostilities or purposefully supported al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations
9204985 i dont want to face another situation where we had the sept 14 resolution and then attorney general gonzales claimed that that was authorization to violate fisa
9204986 she was abducted in karachi in 2003 and had not been seen since everything we can understand about her detention in the last five and a half years leads us to believe that she was at bagram a us detention camp which is notorious for torture
9204987 as media pressure mounted here in pakistan my family received news of the alleged sudden discovery of aafia in afghanistan
9204988 after five years of detention aafia was suddenly discovered i am not that much of a believer in coincidence
9204989 we are hoping and praying that they are all safe
9204990 the real shame is that the children are innocent they havent committed any crime
9204991 an automated e mail system that allows law enforcement agencies to retrieve subscriber and billing details by consulting the system directly all they need is a mobile phone number this process requires no human intervention from t mobile staff the system automatically generates spreadsheets showing the subscriber and billing information and sends them to the law enforcement e mail address
9204992 we consider that these measures are a proportionate interference with individuals right to privacy to ensure protection of the public
9204993 i am concerned that so many authorities who applied for powers to be given to them apparently do not use them and i do not know why this is if this state of affairs continues unexplained then consideration must be given to removing the powers from them
9204994 during the period covered by this report only 154 local authorities made use of their powers to acquire communications data a total of 1 707 requests were made for communications data and the vast majority were for basic subscriber information very few local authorities have used their powers to acquire itemized call records in relation to the investigations which they have conducted indeed our inspections have shown that generally the local authorities could make much more use of communications data as a powerful tool to investigate crime
9204995 the commissioners reports offer valuable oversight and provide reassurance that these powers are being used appropriately
9204996 we need to ensure ripa powers are used appropriately and are not undermined
9204997 invest in properly trained intelligence officers who could operate covertly
9204998 the government is reviewing those public authorities that have access to these powers to ensure that they have a continuing and justifiable requirement for them on completion the government will list the authorities that can use each of the powers and the purposes for which they can use them and set out revised codes of practice
9204999 councils have been criticised for using the powers in relation to issues that can be portrayed as trivial or not considered a crime by the public yet councils are caught between the rock of public opinion and the hard place of being told they should actually be using some of these powers more widely
9205000 it is important that they use these powers carefully and appropriately and we will be working with the surveillance commissioner to help enable this
9205001 the lga has recently suggested that we look at footfall in supermarkets they reckon tesco has pretty good accurate information about the people who use their stores i welcome that kind of imaginative thinking if it can help us to get a better and more accurate view at the local level of what the impact of migration is
9205002 the ceding of intrusive powers to local government and other bodies and giving them access to once sacrosanct personal data
9205003 yet again the government has proved itself unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat terrorism to snoop on the lives of ordinary people in everyday circumstances
9205004 revise draft privacy directives that call for mandatory destruction to permit the retention of critical data for a reasonable period
9205005 he would make sure it would no longer have a say on any justice and home affairs matters
9205006 the european parliament faces a crucial decision is this the type of society we would like to live in a society where all our actions are recorded all of our interactions may be mapped treating the use of communications infrastructures as criminal activity
9205007 any type of data for any type of security purpose for any period at all
9205008 sieben niederlagen aus acht spielen das ist nat rlich nicht das was wir uns erwartet haben

9205011 the difference is between us and previous governments other parties is that we are taking action to help people whether it is rescuing northern rock or whether it is helping people to get back into work as they lose their jobs or tax rebates which are due at the end of next month
9205012 i think it is important that government ministers and particularly me as chancellor level with people i explained that what is happening to every country in the world ours included is that we have a credit crunch the like of which we have not seen for generations

9205029 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9205030 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9205031 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us

9205061 keeping up with your progress is always important if you want to know the state of your success sometimes you compare yourself to others and other times to yourself but in a weaker economy you must keep your comparisons to current situations in other words dont compare the current success of your business with how it was doing when the economy was better inevitably you will not be doing as well as you were and therefore be discouraged to move forward instead look at other similar businesses in the same economy to set your bar for success

9205101 this link between vision and driving makes it essential for motorists to take steps to maintain healthy vision just as they take other safety precautions on the road
9205102 most people are aware of the dangers of drinking and driving but are unaware that driving drowsy can be just as fatal

9205111 the missed chance of 1989 which documented the events leading up to the collapse of the soviet union and warsaw pact centered upon larouches own historic role in the development of ronald reagans strategic defense initiative and the tragic blunder of the soviet premier yuri andropov in rejecting that last best opportunity to end the era of thermonuclear armageddon
9205112 the missed chance of 1989 carrying events forward to the current crisis with particular focus on international efforts led by helga zepp larouche in germany to establish a eurasian land bridge project as a war avoidance policy in the tradition of the original reagan era sdi

9205233 obviously there is somebody that does not have the right information
9205234 as we have already said we support the idea of a joint investigation in which all relevant institutions are involved this must be a broad based investigation we believe this is a right way forward and we will be open and co operative
9205235 everybody is willing to find the truth and to do this you got to get to the facts and compare information that everybody has received

9205241 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights

9205279 the difference is between us and previous governments other parties is that we are taking action to help people whether it is rescuing northern rock or whether it is helping people to get back into work as they lose their jobs or tax rebates which are due at the end of next month

9205291 social energy which is of two kinds mental energy and creative energy
9205292 in human records there is no case of an absolutely monogamous society failing to display great energy
9205293 expansive energy has never been displayed by a generation that inherited a modified monogamy modified polygamy or an absolute polygamy
9205294 those cultures which allowed sexual freedom do not display a high level of social energy their energy is consumed with meeting their physical appetites they do not think large thoughts about the physical world they are not interested in metaphysical questions regarding life and its meaning in these cultures life is for now
9205295 consistent with the maoist stamp in the kind of operation they undertake
9205296 the assailants had left a note written on the letterhead of vamsadhara zonal committee signed by one azad and it is consistent with the maoist methods

9205298 in deep anguish and pain we the christian community of the delhi and national capital region submit this memorandum to you and not to the chief minister of orissa because we believe that by not stopping the ethnic cleansing of christians in orissa in the last six days he has abdicated his constitutional duties to the sangh parivar family of hindu extremist groups and thereby has forfeited his right to be in government

9205300 over forty churches have been destroyed many for the second time apart from once again hundreds upon hundreds of houses burnt in towns villages and forest settlements christians have been chased and hunted like animals

9205302 there is terror all over those who are hiding in the forest and those in the homes no one feels safe the areas are totally deserted

9205307 further it was directed that the state shall furnish the details of how much security forces it has applied for with the central government and how many has the central government so far provided for the maintenance of law and order situation in the state
9205308 in order to then keep it lit until the end of the paralympics as a sign of continuity between the two events

9205325 the appearance of the 31 year old midfielder in the world cup qualifiers against liechtenstein and against finland is certainly in question
9205326 we have seized the opportunity to strengthen the midfield and provide competition for places
9205327 jo has been on different lists of mine for over two years and hes someone we have closely monitored
9205328 hes something different a player we feel will add to the squad
9205329 he can play as a wide man a striker and a bit of both and we believe his versatility will benefit us
9205330 he is a player who comes here with a good reputation he went out on loan to southend last season and did very well
9205331 i am troubled by the tendency of some often young people newly infatuated with reformed doctrine who insist that god cannon possibly love those who never repent and believe
9205332 two points are distinctly stated to us namely that faith in christ brings life to all and that christ brought life because the father loves the human race and wishes that they should not perish
9205333 john has employed the universal term whosoever both to invite all indiscriminately to partake of life and to cut off every excuse from unbelievers such is also the import of the term world which he formerly used for though nothing will be found in the world that is worthy of the favor of god yet he shows himself to be reconciled to the whole world when he invites all without exception to the faith of christ which is nothing else than an entrance into life let us remember on the other hand that while life is promised universally to all who believe in christ still faith is not common to all but the elect alone are they whose eyes god opens that they may seek him by faith
9205334 would punish us in such a way that we would stop talking about god
9205335 what the jehovahs witnesses did was wrong but then they blame the authorities
9205336 here we have freedom of conscience and tolerance at the highest level throughout the world
9205337 she was not given any deportation order which is of course another violation of her rights
9205338 kamandar swore at us insulted our faith and us personally
9205339 knowing where i work he started to threaten that i would be driven out of my job and that the police would punish us in such a way that we would stop talking about god
9205340 infringement of regulations relating to organisation of religious meetings or other events
9205341 carrying out religious propaganda by foreigners or persons without citizenship
9205342 the sect protested against the ruling and it has gone to a higher court
9205343 the police said she did something in zakatala they were right to deport her
9205344 this is a matter for the police or the general prosecutors office
9205345 talking about their faith is allowed but not pressuring others to accept their faith
9205346 what the jehovahs witnesses did was wrong but then they blame the authorities
9205347 here we have freedom of conscience and tolerance at the highest level throughout the world
9205348 a very good guy not a wahhabi very intellectual clever it was possible to talk with him
9205349 there was nothing for them to take issue with musa didnt say anything bad everything was on the record he even stressed that the main thing was to be not in conflict with the state he said that we live in this state have the right to pray and so should just pray and spread islam as there are so many ignorant people
9205350 wasnt and didnt become a terrorist he wasnt bloodthirsty like the anti muslim people say
9205351 on the contrary he and musa taught arabic and islam the young people loved them and will continue to do so too
9205352 brought me petitions and the results of medical check ups after they were beaten up and we wrote complaints in their name
9205353 i didnt know who to appeal to so it wasnt addressed to any particular country
9205354 we are going to defend ourselves but only by any lawful means available to us
9205355 i truly hope that the president of our republic as guarantor of our constitution will not leave this situation unattended and will take all steps necessary to protect us from unchecked police brutality
9205356 even though not one of the accusations against our community has been proven we have no access to justice
9205357 the muslims of kabardino balkaria are completely deprived of their constitutional rights and civil liberties it is very difficult for us to keep our young people from taking retaliation
9205358 functioned openly musa mukozhev and anzor astemirov were sensible and educated people founded the islamic research institute and in response they were persecuted arrested beaten up in mosques now these guys well meaning even a year ago are accused of organising an uprising perhaps over the past five years some have been pushed to a point where theyd take up arms
9205359 after having his ribs broken repeatedly being raped with a truncheon what would any mans response be
9205360 you have a boss an editor for example if he yells at you one two or three times youll tolerate it maybe ten times if he yells at you eleven times youll tell him where to go tell him to stuff his job and quit this is just the same the patience of those 150 guys who went onto the streets had run out
9205361 but they were radical they wanted correct islam to change everything
9205362 they were found to have field radio stations camouflage uniforms
9205363 if youre just involved in islam why train snipers why do you need weapons if youre an institute
9205364 i knew them and their so called institute very well such a beautiful name but an institute should have doctors and professors in order to conduct islamic research and anyone with educational qualifications is with us
9205365 dissatisfied with something offended had family problems or were ex criminals
9205366 what they wanted was unclear but some who wanted to profess islam actively were used to destabilise the situation in kabardino balkaria and through that russia
9205367 when our jamaat was formed we tried to find a golden mean and combine a call for peace with jihad
9205368 in reality this was not a golden mean but an attempt to combine two contradictory things peace and war
9205369 now he was throwing easily but he was in good spirits said riley in his day after remarks following a 36 28 loss at stanford in the season opener
9205370 everything we got from the doctor said he should work on range of motion and throw then just see how it goes
9205371 we wont hurry him and i dont anticipate him playing this week
9205372 its just what we knew said riley of the game which osu basically gave away with three turnovers and another error that led to a safety
9205373 but one thing after it was all said and done there was a lot of good learning to be done thats what we have to do with it
9205374 you cant do that very often and expect to win he said we already know that its always been our m o stopping the run those are the things penalties fumbles run defense that hit you right between the eyes but there was a ton of good football and a lot of good defense
9205375 it will be good to have al back said riley afalava had to sit game 1 because of his off season dui
9205376 played very well and he can even make some more throws he had some stuff hes like to have back the pick to bo mcnally but in terms of playing the game that was right in front of him he did a nice job
9205377 i dont think weve seen everything hes got said riley
9205378 theres plenty of football there for both of them said riley
9205379 hes a big fast back and he kept his pads down said the coach
9205380 we didnt wrap up and bounced off his pads basically thats what happened we got misaligned once and he cut out on us another time i think we had three guys hit him and then our corner tim clark over ran the play on the backside
9205381 we dont want to live like that with 54 passes in a game said riley
9205382 thats really not our style i dont think thats where were at our best
9205383 bodybag game because one school was just going for the paycheck osu gets between 1
9205384 we appreciate the school and the program that were playing as we did when we went to lsu said riley
9205385 there are some preachers who so loudly declare their love of preaching that it is unclear whether it is their own performance and their love of power that has captured them or their desire to minister to the men and women who listen to them

9205392 la pr ctica de llevarse a personas y mantenerlas retenidas en secreto ha evolucionado y se ha extendido a medida que crece el n mero de pa ses que aceptan y justifican este crimen particularmente en nombre de la
9205393 argentina debe continuar y redoblar los esfuerzos para esclarecer todas las desapariciones del pasado y tambi n del presente como el caso de jorge julio l pez
9205394 el 6 de septiembre de 2006 el presidente george w bush confirm que la cia hab a puesto en marcha un programa de detenci n prolongada en r gimen de incomunicaci n en lugares secretos pr ctica en la que han tomado parte en mayor o menor grado gobiernos de todo el mundo
9205395 las personas a las que se mantiene retenidas dentro de dicho programa son v ctimas de desaparici n forzada ya que se las mantiene retenidas expuestas a sufrir tortura y a que se las mate sin que nadie conozca su paradero en julio de 2007 el presidente bush volvi a dar su aprobaci n a este programa
9205396 this is not someone intoxicated with ideas but unconcerned about people nor is it someone who is content to minister at a distance through the books he has written perhaps or through younger emissaries no this mans ministry is not designed first and foremost to produce ideas books or junior colleagues but to serve the people of god and to this he is passionately committed and that passion shapes the prayers he utters on their behalf
9205397 se suicid porque ten a una deuda y era un muchacho derecho

9205401 the audi a3 won over all the judges with its impressive combination of talents

9205403 rucci traidor a vos te va a pasar lo que le pas a vandor
9205404 el mbito adecuado para hacer ese planteo es en el partido justicialista
9205405 la foto hist rica de rucci con el paraguas negro cubriendo al general tiene una lectura m s profunda per n estaba resguardado por el movimiento obrero
9205406 as como se investigan otros tipos de cr menes de lesa humanidad el asesinato de rucci fue de lesa humanidad y siempre reclamamos que se investigue pero lamentablemente hay muchos que no se quieren hacer cargo
9205407 cuando mataron a jos no s lo quisieron hacerle un gran da o a per n tambi n quisieron borrar la estructura sindical peronista y vertical es m s profundo que una venganza
9205408 duhalde no est propiciando una nueva alianza est planteando no atacar a quienes pueden ser variantes pol ticas para el futuro
9205409 para duhalde hay que valorizar otras opciones y tratar de acordar un verdadero pacto de la moncloa argentino
9205410 si lo logra puede ser un buen candidato seis meses es poco tiempo para evaluar una administraci n s lo cuando las cosas se hacen mal ese tiempo es mucho como es el caso de cristina
9205411 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9205412 it looks like theyre incredibly well prepared much better than they had before
9205413 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9205414 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9205415 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9205416 no one is closer to the oil industry than governor palin
9205417 energy production front and center in the policy debate once again
9205418 big oil extended its reach into the campaign of john mccain
9205419 shes viewed as almost anti oil shes probably pro oil from a national perspective but shes not in the pocket of big oil shes fought them at every step
9205420 all night last night there was wind but not like now now its very strong things are starting to fall down
9205421 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9205422 i need beaver pennsylvania i need you to stand up beside me and say now is the time to bring about change in america
9205423 i think its a myth that they have all this anger
9205424 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9205425 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9205426 an admirable person and she will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9205427 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9205428 barack obama has proposed job killing tax increases while our economy is already hurting and his campaign launched dismissive political attacks against governor palins executive state house and small town experience despite his own lack of either
9205429 weve got terribly big challenges now whether it be housing or employment its very very tough times its very tough but were still the most innovative the most productive the greatest exporter the greatest importer
9205430 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
9205431 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know
9205432 and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9205433 the problem is there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9205434 we are hoping to have a quick unfolding of this investigation so we can basically reconcile these numbers which are way too far apart right now
9205435 it is obviously a case where all three have received different bits of information and they need to reconcile this
9205436 obviously there is somebody that does not have the right information
9205437 as we have already said we support the idea of a joint investigation in which all relevant institutions are involved this must be a broad based investigation we believe this is a right way forward and we will be open and cooperative
9205438 everybody is willing to find the truth and to do this you got to get to the facts and compare information that everybody has received
9205439 youve gotten it all backwards its not about me doing my work in you i want you to do your work in me
9205440 notice all the spaces ive already created for you to be you in you have everything you need to be all ive ever wanted you to be one drop of me really is enough to put you in rapture forever relax be you do whatever comes to you to do and remember that doing nothing is ok too whatever comes for you to deal with deal with it in me
9205441 lately when ive felt overly filled up with the medical piece of my life and i think i have nothing left to
9205442 i still want to seek god in life and my life in god
9205443 the extent of the progressive fatigue cracking would have made it possible for the park personnel to detect the deteriorating condition of the rope had they been following the inspection instructions given in the maintenance manual
9205444 inspectors timed the travel of the passenger car starting at 45 feet from the ground the approximate position of the loud noise and ending during the during the approximately two second pause at the top of the tower before the freefall where depressing the emergency stop function would not have stopped the ride as being at least 10 seconds
9205445 in the kdas opinion the injuries to the ride patrons probably would have been limited to cuts and scrapes had the emergency stop button been pressed in accordance with training during the 10 second window of time between the loud noise followed by the cable falling and the freefall of the ride
9205446 the considered opinion of the kentucky department of agriculture is the cable condition and ride operator response were the largest factors contributing to the injuries of the ride patron
9205447 six flags kentucky kingdom will be assessed an administrative fine of one thousand dollars 1 000 for not maintaining the superman tower of power in good mechanical condition causing serious injury
9205448 faulty cable and slow response by the amusement park ride operator as the largest factors in the accident
9205449 a loud noise and screams from passengers to stop the ride gave the operator enough time to halt it and avoid serious injuries
9205450 did not follow several of the ride manufacturers instructions for handling the cable that snapped
9205451 never performed a hands on inspection on any of the cables for the superman tower of power ride
9205452 why have the arab jews waited until 2002 to press for recognition when they are not even seeking compensation
9205453 unlike the demands for holocaust reparations compensation and restitution that jewish groups and the state of israel alike have pursued with vigor over the decades jjac went out of its way to state that its campaign on behalf of jews of middle eastern and north african descent was not seeking monetary recompense for property lost at the hands of arab governments why have jjac and other groups such as the world jewish congress wjc adopted this stance toward the claims of jews from the arab world

9205476 la falta de medios y entre ellos la desaparici n de la frecuencia de radio que compart an las polic as locales de torrej n de velasco y torrej n de la calzada y como es l gico la falta de efectivos humanos son infraestructuras a las que el gobierno municipal no est dotando como se merecen los ciudadanos de este municipio

9205493 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9205494 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9205495 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy

9205593 i showed you many good works from the father for which of them are you stoning me
9205594 for a good work we do not stone you but for blasphemy and because you being a man make yourself out to be god
9205595 he who believes in me does not believe in me but in him who sent me and he who beholds me beholds the one who sent me i have come as light into the world that everyone who believes in me may not remain in darkness
9205596 do you know what i have done to you you call me teacher and lord and you are right for i am if i then the lord and the teacher washed your feet you also ought to wash one anothers feet
9205597 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father but through me if you had known me you would have known my father also from now on you know him and have seen him
9205598 lord show us the father and it is enough for us
9205599 have i been so long with you and yet you have not come to know me philip he who has seen me has seen the father how do you say show us the father

9205605 truly truly i say to you i am the door of the sheep all who came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them i am the door if anyone enters through me he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy i came that they might have life and might have it abundantly i am the good shepherd the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep
9205606 lord if you had been here my brother would not have died even now i know that whatever you ask of god god will give you
9205607 i know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day
9205608 i am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me shall live even if he dies and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die do you believe this
9205609 yes lord i have believed that you are the christ the son of god even he who comes into the world
9205610 you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their great men exercise authority over them it is not so among you but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many
9205611 the son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men and they will kill him and when he has been killed he will rise three days later
9205612 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life for god did not send the son into the world to judge the world but that the world should be saved through him he who believes in him is not judged he who does not believe has been judged already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
9205613 all that the father gives me shall come to me and the one who comes to me i will certainly not cast out
9205614 the christian claim of universal validity is naturally offensive to the adherents of every other religious system it is almost as offensive to modern man brought up in the atmosphere of relativism in which tolerance is regrded as almost as the highest of virtues but we must not suppose that this claim to universal validity is something that can quietly be removed from the gospel without changing it into something entirely different than what it is jesus life his message and his method do not make sense unless they are interpreted in the light of his own life conviction that he was in fact the final and decisive word of god to men for the human sickness there is one specific remedy and this is it there is no other

9205616 be imitators of god as dearly loved children and live a life of love just as christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to god
9205617 everyone who believes that jesus is the christ is born of god and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well this is how we know that we love the children of god by loving god and carrying out his commands this is love for god to obey his commands and his commands are not burdensome for everyone born of god overcomes the world this is the victory that has overcome the world even our faith who is it that overcomes the world only he who believes that jesus is the son of god

9205695 then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me saying come i will show you the bride the lambs wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me the great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her light was like a most precious stone like a jasper stone clear as crystal also she had a great and high wall with twelve gates and twelve angels at the gates and names written on them which are the names of the 12 tribes of the children of israel three gates on the east three gates on the north three gates on the south and three gates on the west
9205696 the gates of the city shall be named after the tribes of israel the three gates northward one gate for rueben one gate for judah and one gate for levi on the east side 4 500 cubits three gates one gate for joseph one gate for benjamin and one gate for dan on the south side measuring 4 500 cubits with their three gates one gate for simeon one gate for issachar and one gate for zebulun on the west side 4 500 cubits with their three gates one gate for gad one gate for asher and one gate for naphtali
9205697 now the wall of that city had twelve foundations and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb and he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city its gates and its wall
9205698 and the city is laid out as a square and its length is as great as its breadth and he measured the city with the reed 12 000 furlongs its length breadth and height are equal

9206034 we sit down with your position coaches and people who arent in any of the daily coaches meetings from the personnel department everybodys got a say we try to get a game plan to see whats the best thing for the team
9206035 sometimes just because of the schedule of things and the amount of time they spend in meetings with their position coaches and special teams and our team meetings to go with two practices a day in camp that can mean the only time i talk to them individually for any length of time after camp starts about how theyre doing is when we release them at the end

9206046 its going to be a very interesting campaign i must say that several months ago i said that it would be great if there was a woman on the ticket that i felt that john mccain would have to pick someone especially if hillary was the nominee but without hillary being the nominee its really quite equally as important because people are looking for a historic campaign and i think this might do it there are a lot of women who are disaffected by how hillary was treated by the media by how she was treated by the obama campaign by how she was treated by the democratic national committee howard dean not speaking up when sexism raised its ugly head in the media

9206050 the passing quality provided opportunities for sarah to attack the second ball and she capitalized on this with her smart play
9206051 by attacking the second ball sarah created advantages for her hitters thus having three players in double digit kills
9206052 the fifth set is a sprint and the first team out of the gate is the team that is going to establish the momentum
9206053 this worked for us yesterday against lipscomb and the exact opposite happened to us today

9206055 im confident that this will continue throughout the rest of the season

9206096 this has been a tumultuous week in the department of public safety and as your governor i apologize
9206097 to investigate the circumstances and events surrounding the termination of former public safety commissioner monegan and potential abuses of power and or improper actions by members of the executive branch
9206098 i think it raises the profile but it doesnt really change the mission or the work
9206099 had threatened to kill my dad and bring me down
9206100 for the record no one ever said fire wooten not the governor not todd not any of the other staff
9206101 what they said directly was more along the lines of this isnt a person that we would want to be representing our state troopers
9206102 this is a governor who really built her name by stepping on the back of sinners randy ruedrich greg renkes frank murkowski
9206103 and now her administration seems to be taking the same approach as the people that she criticized
9206104 this extraordinarily important and beautifully written book will be the foundation to a new metaphor that will guide public policy work for at least a generation
9206105 the ability to forgo larger gains now for a more steady flow of gains in the distant future

9206108 se si tiene traccia dei dati personali relativi a questi cicli ormonali sia che si tratti di variazioni dei livelli di energia di umore o di libido possibile prevedere tali alterazioni e scegliere il momento migliore per le diverse esigenze quotidiane
9206109 la mancanza di interesse per il sesso negli uomini un importante campanello dallarme che qualcosa fuori posto fino al 25 degli uomini hanno un basso o nullo desiderio sessuale
9206110 e tale percentuale potrebbe aumentare se sempre meno persone parlassero della loro scarsa libido
9206111 anche fatica stress fattori psicologici difficili rapporti inter personali scarsa nutrizione insonnia o mancanza di esercizio fisico ne sono spesso la causa
9206112 se avete la disfunzione erettile si dovrebbe fare il test anche per losa
9206113 gli uomini a cui viene diagnosticata e trattati per losa spesso si riscontrano benefici anche sulle loro funzioni sessuali
9206114 in generale ogni uomo e donna ritiene che il massimo della sessualit e della mascolinit sia quello di avere delle misure del pene maggiori rispetto alla media
9206115 sfugge il fatto che agli uomini con pene di grande dimensione spesso difficile trovare partner adatti oltre che trovarsi nelle condiazioni di non poter avere sesso orale e anale
9206116 quello che davvero la maggior parte delle donne vogliono la tecnica
9206117 i want a woman for president but not that woman
9206118 meanwhile in a parallel universe our fellow hillary admirers had this to say
9206119 the one thing i truly have difficulty in understanding is how women continue to pick pick pick at each other and denigrate any achievements other women obtain we are our own worst enemy your articles attacking us pumas may make you a superstar in your own mind and in the minds of your readers both male and female but perhaps just perhaps there will be one or two people who read your words and wonder why is she doing this i wish i had an answer but unfortunately i dont i continue to promote the puma organization we are beyond protesting the misogynist and sexist treatment of hillary clinton throughout the primary campaign we are protesting the selection of an immature inadequate unqualified male for the highest office in the land we are protesting the lack of a full roll call vote of the delegates at the convention contrary to the media misinformation neither candidate achieved the required number of pledged delegates prior to the convention super delegates only vote when the nominee fails to reach the required number of delegates of course all of this information was available with a little research but somehow journalism is no longer journalism it has utterly failed to live up to this premise as the 4th estate to give meaningful and objective information to the millions now that the majority of media is controlled by big business i guess that is to be expected but if people like edward r murrow and others of his stature were able to see what has happened to the media he would probably resign
9206120 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9206121 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9206122 you are going to have a lot of women voters wondering why senator obama didnt tap senator clinton as his running mate
9206123 the reason why women in this country in spite of their rah rahs and womens lib cant forge ahead especially in government their worst hindrance is their own kind theyve burned their bras to promote womens liberation but when it comes to help their own kind move forward to break the ceiling 50 of them are the biggest hindrance
9206124 they need to get hillary out there right now talking about palin is wrong on all the issues that are important to women voters
9206125 but one thing i can say for her palin is that she does do domestic partnership benefits for state employees which is a lot more then most states do
9206126 she will not let anybody tell her to sit down
9206127 are you saying because shes a woman shes not qualified
9206128 if you give players too many choices they end up choosing none
9206129 we wanted to get people whod never subscribed to a game before to play it by themselves then go online and play it with their friends and then they see all this new content and want to subscribe but i think that was a model that caused a lot of confusion and caused a lot of division amongst our community too

9206245 i was teaching greek dance to the kids and they wanted to practice in their bare feet father came in and took off his shoes and danced with them they thought that was the coolest thing
9206246 rejoice good man and wife you shall bear a son in whose birth god will give comfort to his church
9206247 beloved as you see those speaking with you in three persons so also construct the church in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit the trinity one in essence i leave you peace and my peace i give you

9206253 bind my sinful body by the legs and drag it to a swampy thicket and after covering it with skins throw it in
9206254 one of the hard things about the pentecostal charismatic movements is that weve become caricatures
9206255 weve allowed that to happen weve created that in many forms and fashions
9206256 we teach that god is the same yesterday today and forever
9206257 ive had people ask me to pray for them but they say i dont want to fall over
9206258 thats where you have to have a knowledge of the word of god
9206259 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study
9206260 yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up
9206261 but their character does not match their giftedness and they get ex posed because of their character
9206262 in the orthodox church if youve got gifts of miracles and healing and you are a monk they assign you to shovel crap

9206264 during a time of real nato aggression against russia religious sects have been tasked by the west to spread enmity between traditional confessions and society
9206265 unfortunately the organizers of this petition aimed against the russian orthodox diocese were able to convince leaders of komis muslim community that the introduction of the course fundamentals of orthodox culture threatens to incite inter ethnic hatred
9206266 could jeopardize the serbian orthodox churchs mission in general and especially in kosovo and metohija
9206267 the crucial decision on these and other top issues will be made by the holy synod of bishops in due time
9206268 bishop artemije and his priests and monks and devotees enjoy the solidarity and support from the entire church in testifying to the love of christ truth peace and justice and all goodness

9206279 its kind of frustrating sitting there and seeing these guys battle and claw for nine innings
9206280 you just sit there and you know youre not even in the bullpen or out here every five days itll be good to be back and in battle with these guys
9206281 when you watch a guy throw a bullpen session its not 100 percent
9206282 the adrenaline is not there but he looked under control to me he looked good to me
9206283 obviously its been a little while since hes thrown on a game mound especially against live hitters but i thought he looked pretty good his breaking balls looked real good
9206284 well wait to see how he feels tomorrow and well discuss the next move with him but he said he felt good
9206285 its another great arm on our staff and thats what you want
9206286 you want a long list of great arms on your staff and hes another one he gives us more depth down there and its important this time of year
9206287 you have to look at it and you have to be smart about your body and tell them how it feels
9206288 if something feels bad youve got to be honest and tell them weve done it the right way and ive had support from everybody it makes it a little easier when everybody is behind you
9206289 in march microsoft announced that their upcoming internet explorer 8 would

9206291 i just broke it a couple times just to be thorough
9206292 you guys kept me in there when i was losing my head
9206293 if this crowd comes with me the whole way who knows
9206294 i think there are some advantages to deferring but we have played in an awful lot of games where when we win the toss we take the ball and we have done well in a lot of those games as well
9206295 i dont know if there is anything to getting the ball and having first crack at it or giving it up and having that first possession in the second half
9206296 we feel that with so many levels of judgment that go into the force out call it creates a more consistent play when either you get your feet down for a complete pass or you do not

9206300 its one thing for me or anyone else to accept the fact that alopecians or anyone else for that matter may feel the way they do about something but its quite another thing altogether for someone to express their feelings in ways that show little or no regard for the feelings of others
9206301 for example while i accept the fact that my fianc e has alopecia and sometimes struggles with certain issues because of the condition both she and i do
9206302 of course the same applies to me in fact we believe that the so called golden rule is always in order regardless of how someone may feel or the circumstances do unto others as you would have them do unto you
9206303 given how something like alopecia can adversely impact a persons life and how it might leave them an emotional wreck they might easily slip into believing that they have the right to speak to others however they wish about whatever they wish especially when it comes to their medical condition
9206304 nonetheless if unity peace harmony respect and order are to be maintained in alopecia world alopecians and every one else on this site must try our best to be as considerate and compassionate in how we express our feelings as we hope others will be in responding to our feelings
9206305 this is why lately ive had quite a bit to say about bald fetishism and the presence of non alopecians in alopecia world comments and discussions about these matters have begun to degenerate to the point that non alopecians including me are being offended unnecessarily again while all members of alopecia world are free to state their opinions it would behoove all of us to also bear in mind that any freedom without restraints is bondage to excess therefore let all of us be temperate and thoughtful in what we have to say as well as how we say it
9206306 io vorrei sapere una cosa come mai possibile che tutti gli anni quando inizia la scuola si ordinano i libri di testo e i libri di testo non ci sono mai ma io mi chiedo ma le case editrici non lo sanno che a settembre inizia la scuola non una novit di questanno e dallottocento che le scuole iniziano in autunno non a primavera quando sbocciano le primule o in estate durante la raccolta del fieno maggengo a settembre fine ma stampateli prima sti benedetti libri aspettate fino allultimo per essere pi sulla notizia capisco ma dipende dalla notizia per dire napoleone morto ve lo dico io potete pubblicarlo tranquillamente non c rischio che esca dal coma il volume della sfera sempre quello i volumi delle sfere non sono cambiati tranne quelli delle sfere dei genitori che nella questua alla cartoleria alla ricerca del libro scolastico hanno assunto proporzioni preoccupanti

9206315 buongiorno lei pensa mai alla venuta di dio le interesserebbero questi fascicoletti ecco vede noi abbiamo questi articoli la discesa di dio in terra e pu esistere un mondo senza gu rre detto con il tono voce a parabola di chi legge una favoletta a un bambino lei cosa ne pensa eh
9206316 mah non saprei io ehm non mi faccio certe domande sono ancora giovane
9206317 ah e allora se vuole per farsi unidea gliene possiamo lasciare uno che dice
9206318 ma che gli dico lo prendo s magari se lo porto in piscina lo leggiamo insieme io e i miei compagni di classe criticoni e ci facciamo quattro risate poi magari se lo prendo le vegliarde si toglierranno dalle scatole
9206319 ma se deve prenderlo e poi buttarlo via uno spreco
9206320 sa il giorno in cui verr dio tutti saranno contenti e felici e sani sar tutto senza morti e guerre che ne pensa
9206321 perch un giorno dio discender ha presente il padre nostro padre nostro che sei nei cieli
9206322 lui verr dal cielo ma agir sulla terra chiaramente parla seguendo un copione gi scritto e poi ripete tanto per convincersi che ci che sta dicendo non un po assurdo dal cielo in terra
9206323 i am thrilled to be on dancing with the stars this season i have always been a big fan of the show this is going to be an amazing life experience for me ive already begun to work with my dance partner tony and could not be more thrilled to be working with him this is a very exciting time and i look forward to the journey
9206324 okay maybe we can work it out and ryan says
9206325 i told annie she can stay here for a little while until she finds a place
9206326 her feeling is that shes in the way and hes done so much for her and she should be able to take care of herself so she says ill get out i dont want to overstay my welcome and then of course he comes up with an idea that changes her mind cause hes so good at that
9206327 i think the hardest part for me as an actress to get over is that she does trust him but theres no reason for her not to all shes seen is what hes told her but its all good and helping
9206328 the idea of a baby and that whole thing is really very appealing and wanting to help someone whos helped her is ultimately what allows her to say yes its not a practical decision and it becomes more of an emotional one ultimately shes still at a place where he is whats safe thats all the world she knows right now she thinks someone tried to kill her so its a pretty good reason to stay with what you know shes going to get stronger and stronger but its a tough road to come down shes been pretty much wiped out physically and mentally
9206329 i think she is slowly coming around to something but it hasnt really been on her mind perhaps in the back of her mind is that theres this attractive man taking care of her
9206330 its a very sensitive issue and i do everything i can to make it appropriate i get both sides of it but viewers need to understand from my point of view its not marty attracted to her rapist at all if she had the real information it would never be happening i think its an interesting way to bring back this character and have all this stuff exploding in their faces yet another take on the same stuff
9206331 they want shane to accept rex as much as possible but its a little confusing because he thought brody was dead his whole life
9206332 were seeing a guy who has come back from the war and wholeheartedly thrown himself into trying to be a dad to this kid and trying to clean up his act
9206333 this will be an interesting way for us not only to explore what it means for starr to actually give birth and then give the baby away but to start a new storyline with marcie
9206334 ill be honest it hasnt been put on the table as we speak
9206335 if its happening and i dont think it is at the moment then it hasnt reached me is there a possibility i dont know if they want to do it im always amenable to go back to that show ive got a very strong emotional connection to it it depends on how i would go back
9206336 she wants to be with him but when sonny or jason are in trouble shes manning the barricades thats wearing thin on jax
9206337 in the back of his mind when it comes to sonny he knew there was always a possibility that something like that could happen
9206338 there are a lot things i could tell you laughs
9206339 has ptoential but doesnt apply himself i hope my kids dont take after me
9206340 la zapadora is an old spanish word that means female pioneer or explorer
9206341 for years i have wanted to build a creative arts village id been holding the vision for a long long time while i lived in new york while i traveled all over central and south america i wanted to create a place to showcase original items that are imprinted with the spirit of their creator i wanted to build a place that inspired people where they could see what others had done and be empowered to create their own art
9206342 then one day i drove past the ugliest nastiest most disgusting building id ever seen on the back road of potrerillos abajo which is in the exact center of nowhere
9206343 it was literally love at first sight id found my place
9206344 2008 will see us take a huge leap forward in becoming the arts village of my vision we are seeking people who want a place where they can create their works as well as sell them
9206345 for example 800 years ago they were making intricately decorated ceramics in central panama what happened to that tradition the zapadora is now cultivating potters in the central provinces to recover lost techniques and designs
9206346 and where are the people who make metal sculptures where are the stone carvers the textile artists inspired by the kuna molas painters who go beyond tropical cliches furniture makers who create pieces of functional beauty
9206347 we are looking for all kinds of talented people who want to become part of the zapadora arts village

9206366 keep it up youre a couple of breaths from being a carcass
9206367 last time i saw something lying on the ground like that it was roadkill

9206369 oops theres only a queen sized bed i ordered a room with 2 doubles oh well i guess well have to share a bed
9206370 in 1999 led the university of hawaiis defense to orchestrate the biggest single season turnaround in ncaa football history
9206371 at the college level mcmackin gained prominence as the defense coordinator for the university of miami for the 1993 and 1994 seasons there miami won two big east championships and ranked first in total defense scoring defense and pass defense 2 further the hurricans allowed just seven touchdowns on defense in one season
9206372 well get him a couple of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to get him up to 225
9206373 all those running backs theyre the leaders of the backfield theyre the ones to step it up and even help out with the signals thats why we have them back there
9206374 they have a 4x100 that could probably beat any college team in the nation as far as speed wise they probably have the four fastest guys in america that plays football
9206375 i dont care about anyone else all i care about is this u
9206376 illinois and miami are at the top ahead of ohio state and michigan i got a chance to see illinois when i was on the ted ginn bus tour in june they play at more of a fast pace than ohio state and michigan miami plays at an even faster pace than illinois
9206377 forston says the defense has its own motto this year
9206378 tebow needs five rushing touchdowns to tie florida great emmitt smith for the school record smith finished his career with 36 tebow has rushed for at least one touchdown and passed for at least one touchdown in 14 straight games the streak is the longest in ncaa history
9206379 i learned a long time ago an ugly win is better than a pretty loss
9206380 they say teams make the most improvement from game one to game two and certainly well need to do that next week at boston college
9206381 jonathan dwyer is a player that we had in our sights about three times and just couldnt tackle him
9206382 lets get our stinger back and have a greeaat second half
9206383 bailey and z were raving about the line i kept wondering about bailey and moncur getting back in again not sure how much of anything we can take away from last night but you got to start somewhere the addition of those 2 monsters will help wonder how much work theyve gotten in up to the game though young and the d have to have the game of their lives to win this thing kinda like the effort our d turned in vs vatech a few years back
9206384 you arent a real fan if you dont expect to win every game
9206385 i love this team we are young but we will win it all someday soon
9206386 canes didnt pick up one vote in the coaches poll florida ranked in top 5 surely those people know a helluva lot more about the talent of these two teams than we do right im praying we go in there and shock them and everybody else give us a couple of years when weve grown up and gotten some more experience under our belts then itll be a different story
9206387 chi pun i dont think tebow takes anything lightly the guys a pure competitor if he were a cane there wouldnt be enough internet to contain this blog
9206388 they have a 4x100 that could probably beat any college team in the nation as far as speed wise they probably have the four fastest guys in america that plays football
9206389 the best player will start according to how they practice
9206390 marve is the starter he will start every game this year jacory will play in every game
9206391 a joker and a smoker and unconfirmed rumor has it possibly even a midnight toker he dont want to hurt no one
9206392 and cat5 is one of the nicest old guys sorry cat
9206393 a joker and a smoker and unconfirmed rumor has it possibly even a midnight toker he dont want to hurt no one
9206394 this is going to be a real good test for us because theyre going to come out and throw the ball at least 40 times
9206395 its a way for the secondary to make a name for ourselves in the first game
9206396 the michigan game was really a wake up call for us
9206397 we did not stop them the whole day they were up and down the field now when you go into the offseason at least you have something to point to when guys start thinking about how good they think they are
9206398 all you had to do is just turn on the film and just say hey guys lets just go back to last season and lets look at that and well see how good we really think we are
9206399 they do throw the ball around a lot and we do need to improve
9206400 this game just because of what happened last year is going to be an early test for us
9206401 every time you pick up the paper everyone is saying this team will go as their defense goes
9206402 our players are taking hold of that i dont know if itll be a rallying cry or what but i just know this theyll play a lot better than they played last year
9206403 the humidity is going to be a big factor we hosed down the stadium at noon trying to get the humidity
9206404 we got our passing game back and we had a running game now we can mix it up and keep them on their heals if we take a short pass to the house then its going to open up the short field for the running backs theres going to be more room to run in the ten or fifteen area
9206405 ie8 brings some changes that allow much more customization that i think users will be happy with you can unlock the toolbars and drag the ie menu bar to a variety of places in ie8 you can also right click in ie8s menu and choose customize where you can have the refresh and stop buttons moved to the front of the address bar those who also prefer not to have the favorites bar showing will be pleased to know you can turn it off although i dont know why you would want to
9206406 based on our observations of ie7 and ie8 beta 1 usage we learned that roughly 80 of the time peoples destination on the web is a previously visited site in the past people would use their favorites or history or theyd just go through all the steps to navigate to the website again the smart address bar enables you to find favorites and sites in your history by just typing a few letters thats much fewer steps than using the favorites and history center we also added the capability to search the title web address and even folders for those who have organized their favorites
9206407 wed heard from many many users that the find dialog in ie6 and ie7 was always getting in the way making it hard to actually find content on the page so weve added a find bar at the top of the page finally that lets you more easily find content on the page
9206408 copy navigate paste is old accelerators are services that you access directly from the webpage in the context of what youre doing letting you bookmark define email map and more with a simple selection even your search providers are available as accelerators some accelerators provide previews so that you can view the result without having to leave the current webpage clicking on an accelerator opens a new tab with the full result
9206409 in ie8 we make it easier to find sites you might like once you turn on suggested sites ie looks at what sites you visit and then offers recommendations of other similar or related sites right from the favorites bar if you dont have suggested sites on already try it out by going to the favorites center and clicking on the turn on suggested sites button at the bottom of the menu
9206410 the reliability improvements in ie8 beta 2 are big crash recovery is nice but not crashing is even better because in ie8 loosely coupled ie lcie separates the frame the address bar back button etc from the tabs and the tabs mostly from each other crashes are more contained and affect fewer tabs than before we think users will also appreciate having close boxes on all their toolbars so that disabling ones they dont want while leaving the ones they do is easier
9206411 ie8 is more interoperable with other web browsers and web standards the contribution of css 2 1 test cases to the w3c is an important in order to really establish a standard way to assess standards support we think that css 2 1 remains the most important place to deliver excellent interoperability between browsers we think developers will enjoy the improvements to the built in tools as well as the other opportunities to integrate their sites in the users daily life with accelerators and web slices
9206412 the us pro road race championship is a major objective for the team
9206413 virtually the entire team is in good form so this is a race for us to enter with a winning mindset
9206414 we have arrived here as a team a few days early so that the guys can get acclimated to the humidity and reconnoitre the course a bit
9206415 weve come with nine riders so well have a numerical advantage over some other teams but national championships whether they are in belgium or france or the us are always strategically unique because some teams will have 12 or 14 riders while other teams will only field 2 or 3
9206416 without being too cocksure we have an expectation to do well in this event
9206417 i feel like i have recovered well from utah and the rest of the guys have also been riding so strongly that there is a real belief among the guys that bmc should pull off a good result
9206418 for an east coast race the greenville parcours suits me pretty well
9206419 of course my dream nationals course would be at altitude in the dry mountains but i think that this is really a great course where the best man wins
9206420 i have been living in north carolina for the past couple of years so i am really motivated to do well here
9206421 it is a high priority for the team everyone is in good form and i am just hoping that i can have another day like in utah where i was really able to open my legs up for the first time in over a year
9206422 stage 4 in utah was a great day for the team but it was personally very special to me
9206423 that climb was just so special where i was suffering but the good kind of suffering the kind of feeling that justified all those hours upon hours of physiotherapy
9206424 for us the most important thing will be to have a bmc rider finish at the front of the race whether it is jeff or brent or tony or ian or whoever the team is really clicking and willing to work for each other
9206425 if we arent too marked in the peloton thats all the better for us
9206426 it plays to our ends to be the underdog and is motivating for me we work well as a team when we are racing for our own goals and not for anyones expectations
9206427 gavin has a lot of confidence in the team and encourages us to be as prepared as possible
9206428 it is the way we went into utah and that turned out well i believe it is always smart to educate yourself about the course competition climate and things like that
9206429 juggling is such a fun frivolous thing for most people
9206430 im sure that was the deer that was grazing in my flowerbeds all summer thats how he got so big
9206431 surely that buck is larger down than it looked alive
9206432 ill never forget the look on his face when he finally could talk he asked me if i knew what i had just done he told me that was every hunters dream buck

9206442 in sweden 25 of all energy use is derived from biomass
9206443 the biggest hurdle is just getting over the fact that you were out a little bit because of stuff going on in your shoulder
9206444 you just have to be smart about your body and how it feels
9206445 were going to see how it reacts and the way it has been is good hopefully ill have an opportunity to get in there soon
9206446 thats the way you have to manage now if you did this in april and may you may run the risk of burning people out
9206447 but they have not been overworked theyve been good for us
9206448 obviously well see how he feels tomorrow and well discuss it
9206449 they had geoff go down and needed someone off the bench he should be able to help them
9206450 theyll be minor things but things could pick up in the next day or two
9206451 its going to be a big hunt tomorrow especially with those ryder cup guys doing so well
9206452 its still a very open tournament but its always nice to lead after three rounds
9206453 we see no medical reason why the nba insurers have demanded this new element to luols insurance
9206454 their demand came so late and out of the blue we have had no choice
9206455 we are convinced that this is the best outcome for british basketball is the best use of our funds in the circumstances and highlights our commitment to make great britain one of the top basketball nations in the world by 2012
9206456 we played a new system the players have worked hard on it all week and that result should give them a lot of belief

9206459 krishna kumar birla passed away this morning at his kolkata residence
9206460 there were many business leaders who were worried who were apprehensive who were nervous about the economic changes
9206461 understood the importance and the relevance of what we were doing
9206462 he was an outstanding visionary a great parliamentarian a business leader par excellence and a builder of modern educational and scientific institutions
9206463 as an athlete i think hes got a lot more work to do i think hes got to have a lot more fights and really boost his competition and the quality of the opponents he fights as a person and a personality for the sport hes got a great pr company hes done something that many fighters have taken many years to achieve and havent been able to achieve and hes done it in a very short period of time so if hes able to combine that with his physical strength and learn some more technique and maybe getting some more experience then maybe he would get to a level of popularity that could transcend the sport
9206464 the number of deaths in the riots was very high mainly because of the brutal repression of the protests by the bir people are now too afraid to speak out against anything because of the repression of those demonstrations
9206465 nothing could justify such a punitive action since the bir already has a clear mission and the youths protests against miserable living conditions were legitimate
9206466 this was a special operation and as a general rule the bir does not operate in cities but in this case the countrys security was threatened and we had to do everything possible to restore peace
9206467 the bir must secure a vast territory for its actions to be effective it would need to increase its staff to at least 3 000 and to not be sidetracked for police or gendarmerie operations
9206468 the elements of this unit have been trained for a specific mission they are unable to cope with rebel armies
9206469 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9206470 our focus is really on this side of the river
9206471 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9206472 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9206473 i feel as one person who stands up i have a voice and letting it be heard sends fear to the establishment
9206474 theory 1 the u s government foreign governments central banks various broker dealers and a consortium of 10 large u s banks are all acting together in some massive conspiracy to suppress the price of precious metals for 15 years running and not a single insider has stepped up to expose the fraud even though housing fraud stories from insiders are being disclosed at a rapid pace and government cia and other intelligence leaks have been running rampant throughout that entire timeframe
9206475 central banks stand ready to lease gold in increasing quantities should the price rise
9206476 are held primarily to support intervention in the foreign exchange market

9206500 my master puts me up on a pedestal and never touches me unless i ask him to he licks my toes and sucks my ass hole and begs to kiss my lips i am his most prized possession and because of this my relationship is better
9206501 my master strings me from the ceiling so that only the very tips of my toes can touch the ground he swings me from my wrists for hours and sometimes days as he beats me to a bloody pulp with a baseball bat that hes drilled ten inch spikes into poking out at all directions i have hundreds of thousands of permanent scars ten signed casts that stink to high heaven because of how long they had to stay on twenty three sets of finger braces and ace bandages i can stitch myself now because of how often ive watched the nurses do it at the local free clinic and now im going to go do coke until i overdose so my godlike master can bring me back from the dead completely whole and without a mark to do it all over again my relationship is better
9206502 i know for a fact that neither of those things are even remotely possible because i cannot do them and because my master does not do them and no one can do anything that my master does not or i cannot do its just a fact of life because we wrote the book on bdsm and no one else does it the right way so we are better

9206539 football is a game where when you win everyone sings and dances and celebrates but when you lose you moan and are miserable well keep working hard and turn the results round
9206540 we were absolutely disappointed to lose so late on once again we passed the ball well and created not clear cut chances but half chances
9206541 unfortunately we didnt score and then conceded one and lost the game
9206542 it looked like we were going to get a share of the points it looked like there was only going to be one goal if anyone was to score unfortunately they scored it
9206543 obviously were delighted to get the first three points but ive been trying to make the point all week that we felt we were in form last week we played ever so well and didnt win
9206544 we werent playing without confidence but with celtic and rangers coming up next those are two games that we could just as easily lose
9206545 so to go into those two games without a win would have made us feel a little bit uncomfortable

9206556 i am mostly interested in the outskirts of chongqing where the city cant really be seen but rather sensed also construction sites and places of change are of main interest to me they show us metaphorical facets of the huge changes taking place in contemporary china astonishingly chongqing is an unknown place for most people in the western world the city is located in southwest chinas region of sichuan and was the capital of china during world war ii the municipality is populated by approximately 32 million people
9206557 it is fascinating and comforting being able to see far away no trees or tall buildings to block the view a broad view can be hard to capture in a single frame the picture does not tell what is far and what is near nor what is large and what is small an iceberg is the size of a house of flats an island that looks like it is two kilometers away is actually ten times further even my eyes cannot tell these things

9206633 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9206634 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9206635 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9206636 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9206637 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9206638 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize

9206641 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9206642 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9206643 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9206644 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9206645 no one works for someone we all just work together
9206646 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too

9206650 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9206651 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9206652 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9206653 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9206654 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9206655 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9206656 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9206657 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9206658 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9206659 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9206660 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9206661 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9206662 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

9206672 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9206673 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9206674 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9206675 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9206676 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9206677 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9206678 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9206679 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9206680 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9206681 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9206682 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9206683 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9206684 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9206685 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9206686 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9206687 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us

9206756 on the third anniversary of hurricane katrina we must renew our commitment to preparing for any disaster or emergency that puts americans at risk
9206757 while some progress has been made we have a long way to go with the current state of our preparedness lets hope the next storm does not test our nations defenses to the extent katrina did only three years ago
9206758 the death toll has risen to three in huili county a large number of houses have collapsed
9206759 if theres a big rain event ambulances may have a problem getting to us
9206760 theyre setting themselves up for a nightmare that area floods way more so than where charity was
9206761 if the streets flood we cant get to them with the things they need
9206762 we have everything in the hospital that we need to run it
9206763 were really focusing on a group of our folks committed to staying in the hospial and working in shifts during the storm
9206764 for 20 years we have been preparing for the perfect storm
9206765 all of our generators are on the third floor or above
9206766 for katrina we had to use a football field at the high school next door to land copters
9206767 we will discharge as many kids a possible before the storm
9206768 im not leaving camerons side i will hunker down with him on storm night
9206769 the hospital has changed a lot of things since katrina the nurses doctors and surgeons nurse have been in direct contact with me letting me know what to expect its really comforting because the cardiac specialty team stays here in the storm and camerons cardiologist and the cardiothoracic surgeon live within walking distance a couple blocks from the hospital
9206770 patients have been calling to find dialysis clinics in the areas they are going to evacuate to
9206771 and believe me i will find a place in this book to get to for dialysis
9206772 they will automatically have my medical records there im not worried about the hurricane honey
9206773 we have a plan in place to assist those patients
9206774 we realize babies have their own timetable and will continue to be born patients suffering with chest pain and possible heart attacks will continue to present to our emergency room and require special procedures
9206775 we are getting a lot of calls from patients whose family members are outside of this area and want reassurance that their relative will be all right
9206776 the real story is why st louis does not have a viable preservationist lobby pushing for the rehab of buildings like the one at page and kingshighway
9206777 we have no thought of curtailing our clinical activities or advising patients not to be admitted to the hospital
9206778 the cough can become debilitating because it can last for weeks at a time
9206779 some people will describe breaking blood vessels in their face or having bloodshot eyes because theyre coughing so hard
9206780 its not all that unusual to see cases from time to time
9206781 theres always been an emphasis in pediatrics on prevention and immunizations are a big part of that but adult medicine has not caught up
9206782 i think people dont realize the number of deaths that occur because of infectious diseases every year
9206783 i think the flu and pneumonia vaccine are grossly underutilized
9206784 because adults havent been immunized against whooping cough in years the illness is now starting to show up in adults and so thats why theres been a new emphasis trying to immunize adults again
9206785 theres always been an emphasis in pediatrics on prevention and immunizations are a big part of that but adult medicine has not caught up
9206786 i think people dont realize the number of deaths that occur because of infectious diseases every year
9206787 i think the flu and pneumonia vaccine are grossly underutilized
9206788 because adults havent been immunized against whooping cough in years the illness is now starting to show up in adults and so thats why theres been a new emphasis trying to immunize adults again
9206789 for many years its been a struggle to find experienced veterinarians who are qualified and interested in laboratory animal medicine with more high containment labs being constructed across the country the problem is only going to get worse
9206790 we hope this will be a step in the right direction to filling the need for well trained veterinarians who can perform vital research to help protect the publicshealth
9206791 one of the qualities that sets this program apart from other programs in laboratory animal medicine is that it offers residents the opportunity to work closely with cdc scientists and to learn the skills necessary to work in high containment labs which is experience they cant get in many places
9206792 that experience combined with first rate academic study at emory university makes this program unique
9206793 the indian government on thursday revised the death toll from flooding in the northeastern state of bihar from 87 to 47 acknowledging it had made a mistake in the tally

9206796 as we did during hurricane katrina illinois is ready and eager to help the gulf coast states prepare for and respond to hurricane gustav
9206797 the illinois national guard was a critical part of our response to katrina in 2005 when we sent more than 1 100 troops to the region

9206872 church leaders need to be committed to more reading and life long learning with a broader base today smart leaders know whats coming off the presses in fiction and non fiction because they keep up they can answer questions about reincarnation or communicating with the dead
9206873 it takes a long time to prove to people that youre smart it only takes a split second to prove that youre ignorant

9206880 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9206881 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9206882 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9206883 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9206884 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what im really not first and foremost concerned with is this person capable of being president of the united states

9206890 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
9206891 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
9206892 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
9206893 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
9206894 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable

9206899 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means

9206902 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
9206903 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
9206904 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
9206905 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
9206906 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
9206907 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
9206908 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders

9206910 i saw with my own eyes bodies of 50 boys and girls under 15 years of age
9206911 i saw 19 women and seven men i helped locals to dig them out of rubble the first day
9206912 we lined up the bodies of 76 civilians the first day in the local mosque and the afghan intelligence department took a video recording as proof that most of them were women children and all civilians
9206913 there is no doubt that 90 civilians were killed in the us led air strike

9206916 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
9206917 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
9206918 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
9206919 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
9206920 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
9206921 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes

9206924 arguably as the bigger more cost efficient stores move out the poor increasingly are likely to find themselves choosing between traveling farther to purchase nutritious competitively priced groceries or paying inflated prices for low quality processed foods at corner stores
9206925 stores pricing and location decisions in most instances are guided by competitive factors rather than any bias against the poor or their neighborhoods

9206939 we are supporting a plan where the idea is to increase the number of israelis in the workforce
9206940 we want to create a situation where there is no interest in hiring palestinian workers instead of israeli ones
9206941 in my opinion this will likely extend to other sectors as well not just construction

9206943 its important i tell people in this country that we along with every other country in the world face a unique set of circumstances where youve got the credit crunch coming at the same time with high oil and food prices
9206944 take action to help the economy and to help people get through this difficult time
9206945 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9206946 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9206947 gordon brown has briefed out stories that he has an economic recovery plan all worked out meanwhile the chancellor says the downturn will be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9206948 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9206949 until very recently there was no problem there was a state of denial britain was the strongest country in the western world any problems we had were from overseas
9206950 now suddenly weve lurched into apocalypse now the return of the great depression
9206951 these are the same difficult economic circumstances that every other country in the world is having to deal with

9206953 i have been to the occupied palestinian territories many times and even though i realize that the soldier at the checkpoint is not responsible for israels oppressive policies that soldier is still responsible for his conduct
9206954 the bloody cycle in which i live made up of assassinations terrorist attacks bombings and shootings has resulted in an increasing number of victims on both sides it is a vicious circle that is sustained by the choice of both sides to engage in violence i refuse to take part in this choice

9206957 although the claim that the idf sought revenge is weak
9206958 one cannot overlook the fact that out of all the protestors only the complainant was arrested
9206959 all we can do now is stare at the ceiling
9206960 im sure there will be farmers who will have heart attacks when olive picking season arrives and they cant get to their trees
9206961 we were sure the officer would put ashram into the jeep in the evening when we saw the video we were happy we were happy to have released such a thing into the world we wanted to show the world and especially the israeli defense ministry what idf soldiers are doing to us come see the actions of the battalion commander a lieutenant colonel with two falalels oak leaf clusters the commander of naalin first he imposed a total curfew on us a closure on 5 000 people to guard a couple of tractors and now this shooting
9206962 put that kind of officer in lebanon but why in naalin
9206963 we were scared the army would do something to us the btselem people promised us that nothing bad would happen to us but our fears came true there was revenge after two days my father was arrested after three days i was shot in the leg with a rubber bullet while leaving my house we dont have one unbroken window in our house sometimes the soldiers ask me have you filmed us today thats how its been every day since then

9206968 we think it affects the health of the cow they dont breed back it causes mastitis problems the cows become disposable
9206969 these guys have big money for lobbyists and scientists they might try to reintroduce it in canada
9206970 they have a lot more money to spend than a bunch of farmers from renfrew county

9206979 relying on gigantic corporations for mass production of food would threaten not boost future food supplies
9206980 millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness i think it will be an absolute disaster
9206981 government ministers have a responsibility to base policy on science and i do strongly believe that we have a moral responsibility to the developing world to ask the question can gm crops help

9206989 the national voter registration act nvra limits the circumstances in which a state may cancel a voters registration
9206990 the nvra does not permit cancellation based on a match alone
9206991 we are also looking at a state law that calls for purging a bunch of voter registration records that are otherwise eligible
9206992 we follow the state law that was adopted by our state legislature
9206993 there is a section of the nvra that they the voting rights lawyers interpret differently than we do
9206994 what we find is in the vast majority of cases the voter has moved out of louisiana and registered in another state not realizing that they will not automatically cancel their voter registration
9206995 the mildest things confuse people and can ultimately disenfranchise people during elections
9206996 here we are willing to disenfranchise people because they dont send a card back
9206997 all the comparisons do is create a list of possible matches in each state
9206998 we have been trying to get a meeting with election officials to talk about the issues and get their explanation
9206999 its hard to say what happened with the 280 000 supposed out of state movers since we cant get the info from the state
9207000 we are hoping the secretary of states staff will sit down and talk about it

9207002 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
9207003 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
9207004 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government

9207006 a clear and simple message that the united states has a deep and abiding interest in the well being and security of this part of the world
9207007 russias actions in recent weeks have clearly cast grave doubts on its intentions its purposes
9207008 they merit and demand a unified response from the free world
9207009 the level of confidence and trust that people have in russias overall reliability has been put in serious question by whats happened
9207010 the united states has had a priority for quite some time in trying to lead an effort to encourage this diversification of energy infrastructure and pipelines and supplies particularly to europe of gas
9207011 these recent events reinforce the sense that that basic strategy is important and critical and one that has to be pursued if anything with greater energy by us and by our european partners
9207012 we need diverse secure and resilient gas supplies europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
9207013 the transit route through georgia previously thought to be relatively secure and reliable is now seen as vulnerable and threatened by regional hostilities
9207014 georgias entry into nato wouldnt have major strategic consequences for russia ukraine on the other hand is a very different matter

9207016 political appointees at the department of labor are moving with unusual speed to push through in the final months of the bush administration a rule making it tougher to regulate workers on the job exposure to chemicals and toxins
9207017 the agency did not disclose the proposal as required in public notices
9207018 could also undermine state laws that require hospitals to prove emergency contraception to rape victims

9207023 mccain adviser matt mcdonald sought to allay these concerns by citing her experience dealing with international trade issues and even her travel overseas and her eldest sons army service
9207024 but the bottom line is she doesnt have a whole lot of experience she just doesnt
9207025 i wonder if her youth will accentuate mccains age over time in a bad way
9207026 it hurts the experience edge and the hard abortion stuff scares moderate swing voters
9207027 it will appeal to some bubbas but thats not enough

9207034 the juice series is one of our most sensual series with a focus on the parallels between food and sex guys should look at the series as a guidebook towards understanding the female mind there is nothing more stimulating to a girl than combining those two things shay gives it her all in 4 fabulously hot scenes she elevates the series energy as well as her own career we have another hit on our hands
9207035 on set i was screwing so much that i had to keep jumping into a cold shower just to cool off
9207036 but it was obviously worth every minute of orgasmic pleasure it was a great movie celeste knew exactly what she wanted so all the scenes were super easy and fun they were also incredibly erotic being in a celeste movie is like having the perfect boyfriend who is sensitive and listens to you but can still fuck you crazy like in the bedroom her films are intense sex with thought provoking concepts
9207037 shay jordan juice was an all around solid set of sexual misconduct that i think all fans of shay jordan will appreciate when it comes out mark this one down on your calendars shay jordan is a gem in the rough capable of tremendous amounts of sexual energy her work alone makes this worthy of your time

9207042 sono molto contento per come ha interpretato la gara nelle difficolt
9207043 per lattaccante il gol molto importante sono molto contento perch servito a vincere la gara desordio di fronte al nostro pubblico in dieci uomini e con un caldo allucinante abbiamo sprecato molte energie ma abbiamo ottenuto la vittoria con grande compattezza linfortunio alla caviglia sinistra in realt per questi infortuni ci vorrebbe uno stop di un mese circa ho giocato con uninfiltrazione e devo ringraziare tutto il nostro straordinario staff medico che mi ha messo in piedi sono persone eccezionali ho dato tutto spero di averli ricompensati almeno in parte con il gol
9207044 la partita stata agonisticamente valida stato bello vincere cos tre punti in dieci uomini sono la prova che questo ascoli una club compatto che sa soffrire il vicenza ha messo in campo attaccanti molto fisici difficili da marcare ma ci siamo districati molto bene dobbiamo ringraziare anche gli attaccanti ed i centrocampisti encomiabili nel lavoro di ripiegamento giocare in serie b di sera nei periodi estivi potrebbe essere unottima soluzione e magari giocare la domenica nel pomeriggio di inverno come nel campionato 2004 2005 ma noi giocatori veniamo ascoltati poco
9207045 sono soddisfatto del primo tempo viste tutte le difficolt che abbiamo e avremo ancora per un po
9207046 si poteva pareggiare questa partita ma siamo indietro di preparazione e passo dopo passo dobbiamo andare avanti il primo tempo mi piaciuto molto mentre nel secondo tempo siamo calati fisicamente pit non aveva minuti nelle gambe cos come masiero che stava male secondo me ci toglieremo delle soddisfazioni anche se ora c un po di amarezza almeno mi sono tolto subito il dente
9207047 personalmente sono contento per il gol ma non per il risultato ci tenevamo a far bene alla prima in questo derby invece andata male nellultima settimana me ne hanno dette tutte ma io mi sono sempre allenato e ho fatto il mio dovere vedremo cosa succeder tra domani e luned ma tutti i miei compagni sanno che io voglio rimanere a pisa
9207048 ho visto un bel mantova in inferiorit numerica non sempre facile gestire il risultato loro si chiudevano molto e una prodezza quella di caridi ha sbloccato il risultato subito dopo arrivato il raddoppio e la partita per noi andata in discesa domenica si va a livorno contro una grande e di solito noi contro queste grandi squadre non ci smentiamo mai speriamo di ripeterci
9207049 siamo ripartiti con una vittoria e questo un bel segnale avevamo preparato bene la partita in funzione di questo partire con il piglio giusto partita sicuramente condizionata dalla doppia espulsione a mio avviso giusta loro si sono chiusi molto e due prodezze ci hanno fatto vincere la partita quella di caridi con un tiro imprendibile ma anche quello di corona non era facile vittoria meritata
9207050 partire con una vittoria e quello che mi aspettavo ed quello che avevo chiesto ai ragazzi in settimana la partita ha avuto degli episodi che indubbiamente sono andati a nostro favore abbiamo creato molto forse siamo mancati di lucidit in alcune situazioni quando arrivavamo al limite dellarea avversaria ma non siamo riusciti a trovare il guizzo vincente poi per siamo riusciti a colpire e abbiamo vinto la partita di domenica importante quanto quella contro il frosinone il livorno una grande squadra e noi andremo la per cercare come sempre i tre punti

9207120 israel with the strong backing of the united states refused to recognize the democratically elected hamas government and withheld payment of the millions in taxes collected by the israelis on its behalf this caused great economic hardship and undermined the ability of the government to function but it did not reduce popular support for hamas among palestinians and it reinforced the position of islamic and other extremists who oppose negotiations with israel
9207121 anyone who has the temerity to suggest any israeli instigation of or even involvement in bush administration war planning is inevitably labeled somewhere along the way as an anti semite just whisper the word domination anywhere in the vicinity of the word israel as in u s israeli domination of the middle east or the u s drive to assure global domination and guarantee security for israel and some leftist who otherwise opposes going to war against iraq will trot out charges of promoting the protocols of the elders of zion the old czarist forgery that asserted a jewish plan for world domination
9207122 is to avert the threat of us sanctions as well as long and costly court proceedings
9207123 if the swiss are going to keep digging their heels in then ill have to ask all us shareholders to suspend their dealings with the swiss emphasis mine
9207124 the holocausts mystery wiesel avows is noncommunicable we cannot even talk about it
9207125 he is a multi millionaire but carefully cultivates the image of a perpetually disheveled professor although he has won the nobel peace prize the presidential medal of freedom the guardian of zion medal and the oprah book award many people in israel resent the way he has used the holocaust to make his living some israelis refer to him as a shoan the word shoa is hebrew for holocaust with the suffix it indicates a professional specializing in the subject so it is both funny and derogatory not unlike norman finkelstein referring to wiesel as the resident clown of the holocaust circus
9207126 i support israel period i identify with israel period i never attack never criticize israel when i am not in israel
9207127 its a moral issue in the name of morality how can we not intervene

9207129 in 1915 the turkish government began and ruthlessly carried out the infamous general massacre and deportation of armenians in asia minor

9207135 who happen to be jewish who are willing to look at certain issues in terms of their jewishness these are all guys who are in a position to make the decision in these areas for those senators you can get an awful lot done just at the staff level
9207136 it is common for members of congress and their staffs to turn to aipac first when they need information before calling the library of congress the congressional research service committee staff or administration experts
9207137 aipac is often called on to draft speeches work on legislation advise on tactics perform research collect co sponsors and marshal votes
9207138 command performances before aipac have become standard features in the life of a washington elected official like filing fec reports and hitting on interns the stylized panegyrics delivered at the annual aipac meeting have all the probative value of the dniepropetrovsk soviets birthday greeting to the soviet leader joseph stalin because the actual content is unimportant what is crucial is that the politician in question be seen to be genuflecting before the aipac board in fact to make things easier the speeches are sometimes written by an aipac employee with cosmetic changes inserted by a member of the senators or congressmans own staff
9207139 quietly lobbying congress to approve the use of force in iraq was one of aipacs successes over the past year
9207140 are we going to let the fucking jews run american foreign policy
9207141 it is not the business of other nations to make american foreign policy

9207148 it cant be the only county in the country that cant afford to have a jail that satisfies constitutional standards
9207149 when you consider the problems with medical care widespread violent abuse by guards and the fact that its extremely overcrowded with hundreds sleeping on the floor each night its one of the most dangerous places on earth and i dont expect anything to change
9207150 in other countries mechanisms of government are viewed in modern terms as no less fallible than the beings that made them they are machines that must be repaired updated and revamped from time to time in order to remain in good working order despite its reputation for practicality though the attitude in the us is almost defiantly pre modern rather than people like ourselves the constitutional system americans persist in believing was made by a race of giants

9207175 this is an extinct limb and this is another extinct limb this is a modern limb of an amphibian this is a bird an iguana and you can see that theyre all kind of built the same way they all have a single bone and then two bones and maybe a cluster of bones theres a mathematical regularity this is a transparent view of the chicken limb as the bones start to emerge and the ones close to the body differentiate first before the ones furthest from the body its the same for all vertebrates definitely all birds and mammals theyre showing the orientation its called proximal distal dorsal ventral anterior posterior theyre just axes heres a limb bud its confining itself to the tip where fingers form by cells contacting each other which then turn into cartilage some of the cells in between the dotted lines die off they dont interact they just die off or in a ducks foot they become webs they dont differentiate into cartilage what happens when these cells interact is that they undergo a process of condensation theres a clustering this actually becomes one of our dpms the ability of cells to respond to their microenvironment and cluster ill show you what a self organizational process looks like so here looking at cells clustering are places where it starts up randomly some then fade away and some get stronger with self organization you can have random starts at different places but then you have competition between the centers and finally you get a pattern which is going to oscillate the pattern is going to subside and then its going to come back and it will come back with the same statistics but the peaks will be in different places that shows it is a true self organizational process weve taken this self organizational idea and put it into the context of the geometry of the limb and weve said that at the tip of the limb theres something suppressing it from happening cells have to escape from this suppression to organize into spots or rods the geometry changes subtly as the limb grows in length under some conditions youll get one skeletal element under other conditions youll get two under still other conditions youll get three or as in the human hand five

9207179 appreciative interviews are designed to collect rich qualitative information in the form of stories which carry a wealth of meaning and sometimes a powerful emotional charge rather than dry quantitative data consisting of figures and statistics
9207180 the aim is to uncover the forces which give life to the organisation
9207181 in an advocacy program instead of having managers whom you report to you instead
9207182 advocates are responsible for conducting the annual performance review and work with the advocatee on things like compensation professional development setting goals etc they do not direct how someone uses their time the advocacy program works best in environments of highly motivated folks who can structure their own time because no one else is going to structure it for you

9207247 moscow alleges that there atrocities were meted out on the south ossetian population russia or south ossetia must document whether this is the case and to what extent
9207248 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one
9207249 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships

9207263 the colonization of american government will only end with creation of a real fifty state democracy in the u s a which could help bring about a real one state democracy in palestine unfortunately anything less will mean much more pain and suffering possibly of epic proportions and not only in palestine and not only for jews

9207312 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9207313 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil

9207350 the university of california applauds the legislatures passage of this legislation which provides new tools to law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of crimes against academic researchers and their families
9207351 the legislature led by assemblymember mullin has taken an important step in supporting university research that aims to enhance the health and well being of people throughout california and around the world
9207352 we are hoping to have a quick unfolding of this investigation so we can basically reconcile these numbers which are way too far apart right now
9207353 it is obviously a case where all three have received different bits of information and they need to reconcile this
9207354 obviously there is somebody that does not have the right information
9207355 as we have already said we support the idea of a joint investigation in which all relevant institutions are involved this must be a broad based investigation we believe this is a right way forward and we will be open and cooperative
9207356 everybody is willing to find the truth and to do this you got to get to the facts and compare information that everybody has received
9207357 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9207358 these subjects are part of a longer and mid term discussion

9207378 i find it more than a little amusing how the choice of sarah palin has given people on the other side of the partisan divide a serious case of intellectual whiplash
9207379 dick cheney and donald rumsfeld had tons of experience and they ran the country into the ground
9207380 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world
9207381 will work for an america with more partners and fewer adversaries
9207382 america can do better than that bush administration and barack obama will but first we have to elect him

9207400 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
9207401 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
9207402 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
9207403 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
9207404 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
9207405 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
9207406 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
9207407 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
9207408 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
9207409 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
9207410 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
9207411 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
9207412 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
9207413 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
9207414 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
9207415 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
9207416 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
9207417 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
9207418 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
9207419 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
9207420 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
9207421 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
9207422 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
9207423 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
9207424 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
9207425 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
9207426 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
9207427 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
9207428 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
9207429 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
9207430 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
9207431 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
9207432 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
9207433 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

9207478 a london student who had travelled to france to highlight problems surrounding clandestine immigration
9207479 she appeared to be working alone which was clearly a very dangerous thing to do
9207480 we fear that the men she was reporting on attacked her in the wood where they were staying
9207481 there are lots of journalists including students who come here to get to the heart of whats going on to write reports and produce films
9207482 when reporters contact us we always ask to accompany them we know the refugees as we see them everyday
9207483 we would never allow a young female adventurer in this wood especially not at night on tuesday we did not receive any requests for assistance and nor did any other charities
9207484 yes i saw a young journalist with a camera lots come this way
9207485 i dont know who she was exactly but she was young perhaps 30 and a student from london the word is that something happened to her in the woods

9207514 the most unlikely choice of running mate since george h w bush tapped then sen dan quayle in 1988 a move as risky as it was bold
9207515 sarah palin is exactly the right choice for john mccains running mate
9207516 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9207517 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9207518 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9207519 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9207520 a potential vice president with the ideology of dick cheney and fewer qualifications than dan quayle should send arctic shivers up our spines
9207521 what does it do to the argument that obamas not ready
9207522 the mccain campaign is revelling in the fact that palin is a game changer
9207523 but why a game changer when youve been gaining to gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful is he ready to lead line of attack seems near suicidal
9207524 hey time for republicans to go out and vote for the eskimo and the snow man
9207525 he had spent the day with friends and then he and his family stayed at the barbecue until late on monday night
9207526 they were enjoying a few drinks and seemed in good spirits
9207527 there was certainly no sign of anything untoward they seemed absolutely fine just completely normal
9207528 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
9207529 a lot of work has been done by the fire service overnight to damp it down and reduce the temperature enough for work to stabilise the structure to begin and make it safe to enter
9207530 once it has been deemed safe which we are hoping will be either this evening or tomorrow specialist search teams and forensic experts will go in
9207531 it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined
9207532 officers have completed a search of the outbuildings and are now in the process of removing vehicles from the site we will enter the main part of the house today and forensic specialists will begin the lengthy painstaking process of sifting and examining all the contents
9207533 chris loved the house and knew how much it meant to jill and kirstie he spent thousands and thousands doing it up and invested a huge amount of his life into making it the perfect home for them
9207534 the idea that it could have been repossessed would have devastated him
9207535 chris was as he always was happy and enjoying himself there was nothing to suggest there was anything untoward and his behaviour was perfectly normal
9207536 we can condemn russias actions we can help georgia rebuild and we can send a signal to ukraine that youre welcome as a future member but i dont think theres any consensus for sanctions
9207537 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
9207538 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
9207539 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
9207540 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
9207541 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago
9207542 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
9207543 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics
9207544 victimised by threats that he would be sacked unless he suspended the tribunal proceedings
9207545 the met will not at this time be commenting publicly in detail on the content of assistant commissioner ghaffurs claims other than to say that we do not accept the charges of discrimination against us and intend to robustly challenge them
9207546 it is long past time we all shut up stop making public statements about private disputes and get on with the job we are paid to do
9207547 we have taken significant steps to tackle infections including c difficile
9207548 however people who are very ill are vulnerable to infections not all of which are avoidable in july 2005 we wrote to the nhs to make clear that we wanted infections such as mrsa and c difficile to be reported more accurately on death certificates we believe the rise in the number of c difficile cases recorded as a contributing factor on death certificates does not represent a rise in actual deaths but primarily an increase in awareness and reporting
9207549 please all of the people all of the election time
9207550 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
9207551 the scale of this criminal enterprise is unprecedented in this country
9207552 the roll call of deaths and injuries is horrific some 30 to 40 of these weapons are still unaccounted for and regrettably but doubtlessly the roll call of death and serious injury will continue to rise
9207553 i wonder matthew is it the near future bleakness or the whitish cinematography that has you thinking com
9207554 thats partly about coaching and competition in the traditional sports but also its about saying lets ask children what they want if theyre not being catered for in the mainstream system
9207555 i think in the past what we have not done is to give young people what they wanted we have assumed what they wanted but traditional sports have not appealed to some and then not surprisingly theyve dropped out of sport at 16
9207556 its all about not just forcing a particular sport on anybody but trying to give all young people something that will appeal to them
9207557 since beijing it is has become widely acknowledged both here and abroad that we now have a world class system for developing medal winners but rivals like australia are not just looking at our elite sport system anymore outside britain they are now also acknowledging the giant leaps we have made in school sport
9207558 we have put a lot of money in and i make absolutely no apology for that
9207559 i lose count of the number of times ive heard people talk about the problem of childhood obesity
9207560 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
9207561 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
9207562 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
9207563 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
9207564 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago

9207568 chris loved the house and knew how much it meant to jill and kirstie he spent thousands and thousands doing it up and invested a huge amount of his life into making it the perfect home for them
9207569 the idea that it could have been repossessed would have devastated him
9207570 chris was as he always was happy and enjoying himself there was nothing to suggest there was anything untoward and his behaviour was perfectly normal
9207571 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards to this court
9207572 in that case i enter a plea of not guilty on your behalf
9207573 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community when in fact it is a court of nato that is trying to liquidate me
9207574 was war deine bis jetzt peinlichste situation bei der du am liebsten im erdboden versunken w rst

9207579 it could turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
9207580 to check its radio controlled weapons and onboard communications systems
9207581 the issue about this is it affected republicans and loyalists
9207582 people from unionist and nationalist working class areas were in the wrong place at the wrong time and ended up spending their lives in jail
9207583 so many of them were in jail for things they actually had nothing to do with many were convicted by signing false statements under torture or under the flimsiest of evidence and were locked away for years
9207584 these people are terrorists who maimed and murdered innocent people they want to rub salt in the wounds of the victims of their terrorist crimes
9207585 theyve wiped out half my family its disgusting that anyone could do what they appear to have done
9207586 we have no idea what we will find in there three bodies or none the damage cause to the place is absolute its just a shell in there but because theres a danger of collapse we have to wait until it is safe to go in and start hunting for bodies
9207587 every time i hear wendy speak i learn something new not just about cape wind but about politics in america she embodies the best of this countrys journalistic tradition reminding us all why a free press is so critical to a free society
9207588 i loved the way you framed the issue as being primarily about democracy rather then clean energy i think that is a critical point that has been left out of this debate
9207589 enough political intrigue to keep a john grisham fan happy
9207590 a ripe subject populated with the sort of people who would be among the first to count themselves as friends of the earth but the last to accept an environmentally friendly energy source if it meant the slightest cloud on their ocean views
9207591 gun factories themselves are very rare and there have only been a relatively small number in recent years
9207592 these are self taught people who are supplying directly into criminal networks
9207593 they were weapons produced solely for killing and in our view the only possible consequence of their actions was the endangering of human life
9207594 the availability of these weapons is clearly fuelling violence on our streets they have caused devastating shootings deaths murders mayhem in inner city london

9207601 id be upset if the best people in the party didnt want my job
9207602 look i spent ten years as a sort of political heir apparent and its not easy
9207603 what theyre all doing is try to set out ideas for the future and ways to focus our attack on the tories

9207607 i have found the right partner to stand up to those who value their privileges over their responsibilities
9207608 outstanding reputation for standing up to special interests and entrenched bureaucracies
9207609 i will be honored to serve next to the next president of the united states

9207611 i cleanse myself from all the sinful things i have said
9207612 i cleanse myself from all the sinful things i have heard
9207613 what is your take on global warming and how is it affecting our country
9207614 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9207615 how this woman is supposed to run the free world with five kids is beyond me
9207616 the center for biological diversity an environmental group has argued that global warming and the reduction of polar ice severely threatens the bears habitat and their existence in fact there is insufficient evidence that polar bears are in danger of becoming extinct within the foreseeable future the trigger for protection under the endangered species act
9207617 that being said i will vote for obama because i feel i have to as a democrat hillarys speech reaffirmed my decision to do so but will a triumphant and unifying convention have any real impact in the polls dowdle suspects not noting the party faithful are usually the only ones who regularly tune into political conventions ratings have increasingly declined for conventions as they became less important over the years and no real news emerged from them dowdle says you get people tuning in but those are mostly the people who are decided voters

9207624 the running mate who can best help me shake up washington
9207625 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9207626 shes got the grit integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today
9207627 when i found corruption there i fought it hard and brought the offenders to account
9207628 to have been chosen brings a great challenge i know that it will demand the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less
9207629 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9207630 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9207631 ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket as i indicated in my speech last night i think that he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him in in his policies
9207632 but the fact that shes been nominated i think or will soon be nominated i think is one more indicator of this country moving forward
9207633 i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate
9207634 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9207635 alaskans are calling for a complete and fair investigation into why walt monegan was fired and if it had anything to do with trooper mike wooten
9207636 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9207637 these subjects are part of a longer and midterm discussion
9207638 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9207639 between 30 and 50 cops with guns drawn and pointed at peoples heads
9207640 they said they were looking for x boxes computers paper materials paint banners strips of fabric i guess for molotov cocktails
9207641 they took all our computers maybe ten desktops and five or six laptops for evidence
9207642 im so sorry my city is treating visitors this way
9207643 all the relevant players are here in south africa at the moment and i think the length of the discussion will be determined by what progress they make
9207644 i need managers i want workers people who take people to work i do not want people with own business i want one business the peoples business
9207645 lets us be united lets not be destroyers of our party we have destroyed part of it now that we have survived lets ensure the party is strengthened
9207646 were not talking about corruption or bending to influence it is purely a professional degree program for professionals who are working full time and have needs the typical student doesnt have
9207647 i think it is a slippery slope and we went too far down that slope we need to get back up on a firm ledge and certify for graduation correctly when we make decisions about transferring credits and core substitutions make sure we have a solid foundation for those kinds of decisions
9207648 the bresch situation is someone who did not graduate and 10 years later going to a decision
9207649 i continue to be amazed that mylan has taken absolutely no action with respect to heather bresch she continues to hold her position and collect her large salary no consequences for the breach in ethics why is that
9207650 perhaps these mountain party and other alternative candidates have the best ideas but they cant win
9207651 an independent vote is a wasted vote so roll over and take it up the behind as usual this state belongs to king coal and his illegitimate love child mistress big pharma
9207652 if you tree huggers dont like toxic blue haze soup for breakfast then you should move back to russia

9207655 hers is not the usual condescending conversation with children that is actually aimed at the adults listening in
9207656 theres nothing i know about the bushes that the average person couldnt find in a published book
9207657 they told me they liked the character of charlie blackwell and they dont want to they think hes endearing and funny
9207658 sarah palin reinforces john mccains plan to continue the bush cheney big oil energy policies
9207659 palin may be new but her big oil energy agenda is very old fashioned
9207660 the fear would be that our very rich fish resources would be put in jeopardy
9207661 getting this huge supply flowing is key for our national security and energy independence the key to that is the expandability of this pipeline there are other companies besides our oil producers who want the opportunity and vehicle to get gas to market were going to open up the north slope basin to these explorers and not just have the same few companies were going to allow more exploration and development this way which is what this country needs to survive
9207662 another condition that was unacceptable to me unacceptable to alaskans that these companies were negotiating with the prior administration was to lock up pipeline transit rates for decades
9207663 there may need to be adjustments down the road we cant bind or tie the hands of future legislators
9207664 im not anti industry im not anti production the oil company chief executives i respect are doing what the shareholders have mandated that ceo to do look out for their bottom line my bottom line for the state is to do the same for alaskas shareholders the people of alaska own the resources i have to look after their interests
9207665 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president
9207666 it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9207667 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9207668 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9207669 well hes made his choice but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending 10 billion a month in iraq
9207670 america knows this is john mccains agenda we cant afford four more years of the same
9207671 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely
9207672 were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9207673 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9207674 ringing off the hook with women mostly clinton supporters saying they want to come on board they like her
9207675 i find it a curious choice if the play is for hillary clinton supporters slow to get behind obama
9207676 so how do you appeal to them with a candidate who is militantly pro life and whose background by any comparison to clinton excuse the expression pales in comparison
9207677 still so proud today thank you john mccain for standing up to sexism
9207678 no se trata de dejar nicamente a las autoridades la soluci n del problema
9207679 i noticed that you have some rolls there heres my suggestion
9207680 if i share my secrets with her shes gonna look just as good as me perhaps even better gasp and you know i cant have that
9207681 what are you using to make your hair grow youve got to be using something
9207682 they have quite remarkable planning and self organisation more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
9207683 ive a spare bed in a triple room take it
9207684 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
9207685 the broadcast networks are nervous all the time and it poisons the process im never nervous here because we got picked up for 20 episodes im not living in fear that ill be canceled after three weeks
9207686 im in the same building on the paramount lot with nbc and cbs freshman comedies kath amp kim and worst week
9207687 theyre nice people but if they dont perform in their first three weeks well be the only ones left in the building
9207688 we are excited to announce a magical slate of platinum titles for the first time on blu ray high definition this celebrated collection of animated features demonstrates disneys commitment to deliver great content
9207689 the landscape for the blu ray format is very healthy and we believe that the enhanced movie experiences that the format provides such as disneys bd live network offer consumers the chance to reinvent the experience of watching movies in their homes and the interactivity and connectivity that is being provided will truly make the family room relevant again
9207690 disneys bd live experience will enrich and deepen the overall consumer experience and we are delighted that snow white and the seven dwarfs will be the one that will launch disneys bd live network worldwide
9207691 what is it about palin people just seem to like her i cant figure it out
9207692 anchorage dj bob lester unleashed a vicious mean spirited poisonous attack on senate president lyda green last week while our governor was live on the air with him
9207693 she came off looking immature herself almost high schoolish it was conduct unbecoming a governor
9207694 either sarah palin has talents and skills we were not aware of
9207695 whats next saying that palins daughter was the one who actually gave birth to palins latest child
9207696 mcsame only met palin for a couple hours picking her to fill the most important slot in his administration strikes me more like a guy throwing darts than the actions of an experienced legislator
9207697 what other country in the developed world produces beauty queens who hunt caribou and serve up a terrific moose stew
9207698 they have been going on and on about obamas lack of experience if they really believe that is a legitimate issue why would they make a choice like this for vp
9207699 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same

9207719 normally you just paint the hull but over time you get barnacles and all kinds of buildup on the hull and that creates friction which takes more fuel to move the ship through the water

9207727 well i was told my role in life was to attract the likes of you so that the angler can meet customer requirements his wife i think and so they cultivated and processed me i think they call it a supply chain but somehow the process went wrong and well here i am
9207728 you know i dont actually know it seems that i just appear at the right time in the right place almost like magic well i was raised somewhere else and then transported at great distance to somewhere else they put me in a box and shipped me somewhere else again and the strange thing was when the angler chose me for his step in the process i recognised that i had only moved about 300 meters but it seems i had travelled several 1000km to get here i mean it was an interesting experience i had a great time meeting others saw strange places you know got around a bit it was fun
9207729 humans have this thing called oil and it seems to be running out and then they will have to come up with a new idea to send you worms half way around the world to process you oh and everyone is saying it will get more expensive whatever that means

9207747 on friday leo von scheben commissioner of the state department of transportation said the bridge money could be used to build roads in alaska
9207748 there is no question we desperately need to construct new roads in this state including in southeast alaska where skyrocketing costs for the alaska marine highway system present an impediment to the states budget and the regions economy
9207749 first the democrats say that this election is about understanding people in small town america

9207814 i always like the idea of using technology in a way that it wasnt meant to be used the struggle to get your head round what you can do with it

9208010 como parte de esta familia ferroviaria que somos nos sentimos felices de ver estas obras que se est n multiplicando sobre todo en nuestros pa ses donde el tren estaba olvidado ver estas instalaciones nos da la impresi n de que en cualquier momento despegamos del mundo
9208011 hemos visto los pasajeros venezolanos gente que cuida su tren y defiende lo que est usando lo cual habla de un pueblo civilizado al que le han puesto un sistema de transporte bueno y por ello lo cuida

9208165 in governor sarah palin mccain chooses a running mate with zero foreign policy experience
9208166 for a party which claims it is trying to reach out to the jewish community mccains pick is particularly strange prior to todays selection palin apparently has never spoken publicly about israel
9208167 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9208168 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9208169 sarah palin is completely unknown to the american jewish community there is no jew outside of alaska who has a relationship with her

9208237 for the last seven years this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century the emergence of russia china and india as great powers the spread of lethal weapons the shortage of secure supplies of energy food and water the challenge of climate change and the resurgence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front against terrorism
9208238 in recent days weve once again seen the consequences of this neglect with russias challenge to the free and democratic country of georgia barack obama and i will end this neglect we will hold russia accountable for its actions and well help the people of georgia rebuild
9208239 the war that began in georgia is no longer about that country alone it has become a question of whether and how the west will stand up for the rights of free people throughout the region the outcome there will determine whether we realize the grand ambition of a europe that is whole free and at peace
9208240 when the war between georgia and russia first broke out democrat barack obama was in hawaii on vacation he interrupted his holiday to issue a statement of support for georgia but his words were more measured and came later than either the white house response or republican john mccains
9208241 this week obama beat the white house by more than an hour and mccain by two could it be that senate foreign relations committee joe biden newly added to the obama team as his running mate has added some muscle
9208242 the speeded up obama response came after russia recognized two breakaway regions abkhazia and south ossetia as independent countries

9208250 from nontraditional sources such as public safety entities and private sector organizations
9208251 to anticipate identify prevent and or monitor criminal and terrorist activity
9208252 a vast database of names that feeds the nations terrorist watch list
9208253 would actually be less capable than the u s government terrorist tracking system it is meant to replace
9208254 the program appears to be on the brink of collapse after an estimated half billion dollars in taxpayer funding has been spent on it
9208255 technical flaws hinder terrorist watch list congress calls for investigation

9208373 you mean sarah palin the unknown woman with almost no experience who will have no influence over mccains decisions whatsoever but will better serve to sit there quietly and be a woman and speak only to point out that she is indeed a woman just like hillary clinton and so all the feminists will ignore john mccains voting history against equal pay for women because all they really care about is that a woman wins something this election season

9208387 mccain had to protect his reputation as an opponent of status quo washington he had to pick someone with the shortest washington r sum he did that he picked someone the right wing is going to be happy about but its a gamble
9208388 what does it do to the argument that obamas not ready
9208389 hes chosen a washington outsider who will be an ally for him in shaking up the way things are done
9208390 this is someone with solid conservative credentials but solid credentials as a reformer and its clear after watching todays event no one is going to push sarah palin around not barack obama and not
9208391 hes a respected washington lifer whos run into political forces that are bigger than himself and hes responded by making a decision that feels panicky
9208392 in a way mccain has set a trap on the experience argument
9208393 because if they start picking on her on experience its going to backfire with women
9208394 yo considero personalmente que ese problema s lo se resolver a trav s del di logo y la negociaci n
9208395 este pa s tiene que conocer un escenario de paz y democracia que le permita seguir su futuro y al mismo tiempo siempre dentro de ese proceso liberar a todos los presos y presas pol ticos vascos

9208402 lo nico que cabe es que la eta deje las armas y los presos cumplan la integridad de sus penas algo que esperamos o r de una manera clara y contundente a los dirigentes pol ticos de nuestro pa s
9208403 un problema pol tico de fondo sin resolver en este pa s

9208415 youre not going to see something like that if you hunt legally
9208416 because you cant legally hunt at night and thats when that one was shot
9208417 when i first became a captain two years ago we had a leadership conference
9208418 basically trying to solicit ideas from the field and then implement the best ones
9208419 idaho had plaques that said who the taxidermist was and it sort of looked like advertising
9208420 the entire time the one thing to me was i wanted to have it paid for by the poachers
9208421 when you wonder why you have to pay so much for licenses and tags heres why
9208422 i know people who have put in for bighorns their whole lives and you only get one chance
9208423 ive snuck up on a few bulls legally but i didnt get a shot
9208424 but just getting that close that memorys frozen in your mind forever
9208425 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9208426 the need and demand for special education teachers is so high because weve become so much more aware of students with disabilities
9208427 the competition between districts is pretty heavy and supply is pretty low
9208428 were in a better place this year than weve been in previous years
9208429 it doesnt mean weve solved the problem by any stretch of the imagination but were making gains
9208430 these are people who already live in the community and want to be here in salem keizer
9208431 this gives them an opportunity to bury those roots even deeper and stay with the district its a win win
9208432 i was thinking this is pretty crazy for a traffic stop day two
9208433 we just need to do a little bit better job of creating some seems for them
9208434 but they can gain some confidence from ok were going with the other guy but hes had some experience
9208435 ive shown i can play in the games and win
9208436 i feel like i could get the team a win if im in there
9208437 i think hes fully capable of leading this team in any direction we need to go
9208438 gives us a clearer insight to focus on just one guy
9208439 but we think regardless who they put in their system its a very formidable offense
9208440 he can throw he can run break tackles hes faster than some dbs
9208441 its going to be a pain but weve got to contain him
9208442 we have some plays designed for me to run and certain times doing what i feel is best
9208443 ill do whatever gives us the best chance to win
9208444 were beginning the season with a rival and ending the season with a rival oregon state
9208445 i dont think you can ask as a coach for anything more than that
9208446 we had linemen going the wrong way we had guys fumbling the ball we had guys running into each other on the routes it was kind of just a mix then we had a couple of chances to score in that thing and just didnt get it done
9208447 mostly i was disappointed that we didnt run the ball inside in the first half i felt like the other errors were things that were fixable
9208448 if all 11 of us in our defense do what were supposed to do not try to go out of our way to do something else that may work or may not and also our defensive speed is like phenomenal like no one can run outside when you cant run outside and you cant run inside you got to go to the pass and when you know what theyre going to do its kind of easy to play defense
9208449 helped us trust in our coach made us believe hes calling the right plays believing in our quarterback getting us the ball and our line because they were having trouble in the first half and they stepped up and showed us they could perform
9208450 i think it was just first game jitters coming out
9208451 were just trying to get him out in the open field let him make his moves do what he does
9208452 thank you salem and thank you oregon for being so forward and progressive in your thinking
9208453 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane

9208488 i was trying to make a play for the team but unfortunately it didnt work out that way
9208489 it didnt happen i have to learn from this and try to make better decisions
9208490 he made a mistake but everybody makes mistakes i made mistakes tonight its just one of those things we have to learn from and build off of

9208582 i believe that someday we are going to have a woman president possibly during my life and ive often thought the best way to pave the way for this was to first nominate and elect a woman as vice president but i think mondale made a serious mistake when he picked geraldine ferraro as his running mate in my view he guessed wrong in deciding to take a congresswoman that almost nobody had ever heard of and try to put her in line for the presidency i dont know who among the democrats might have been a better choice but it was obvious mondale picked geraldine ferraro simply because he believed there was a gender gap where i was concerned and she was a woman

9208852 we werent running good enough to get it we just werent we were just going to take up space we were going to take up oxygen being one of the 12 chase entrants and thats exactly how i felt the last two years
9208853 were running good enough to get in the chase and were running competitive enough to make a run at it the championship
9208854 im glad that were on our way back to getting ourselves into the chase but i think we can be a tremendous amount better right now than where were at
9208855 i think we could be third in points or fourth in points if we just got some of those finishes there are a handful of them that are just such dumb things
9208856 a lot of those not so great runs this season have been self inflicted speeding at pocono we had a great car caught the air hose at michigan and had to do a pass through a couple others were stupid stuff that happened
9208857 i just like to slide under the radar a little bit
9208858 right now it looks like weve got ourselves a good spot in the chase
9208859 if we were sitting here talking about this in front of the richmond race or after id be pretty damn excited being seventh in points i know the chase seeding deal is going to be different but im pretty happy with what we did
9208860 when the chase comes if we make it i feel pretty confident we can put together 10 flawless races
9208861 i dont know if our 10 flawless races are going to be enough to win the title or not as of right now it doesnt look like it is because they busch and edwards are a little bit faster than we are but theyre going to have to put together 10 flawless races as well hopefully our 10 best races we can put together are going to be good enough

9208866 at 22 years of age he will only continue to improve and mature as a player nhl defensemen typically dont hit their prime until 25 26 years of age and we look forward to working with andrej throughout that time and beyond
9208867 the acquisition and signing of andrej is a strong statement to our players and our fans that the lightning ownership group is committed to putting the best product on the ice now and for years to come
9208868 last years team is over the giants arent the super bowl champions anymore we lost by four points in the playoff game and thats what happened the giants certainly deserved to win it and they proved it but that was last year were going to go forward from there

9209034 bukanlah puasa itu hanya sekadar menghentikan makan dan minum tetapi puasa itu ialah menghentikan omong omong kosong dan kata kata kotor
9209035 mereka itu suka mendengar perkara yang bohong dan memakan barang yang haram

9209087 you dont expect the players we have got to concede goals but they are and they take a big responsibility for what happened today

9209090 it was a poor penalty no doubting that but it was a good save as well
9209091 the lord is slow to anger and great in power and will not acquit the wicked the lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm and the clouds are the dust of his feet he rebuketh the sea and maketh it dry and drieth up all the rivers bashan languisheth and carmel and the flower of lebanon languisheth the mountains quake at him and the hills melt and the earth is burned at his presence yea the world and all that dwell therein who can stand before his indignation and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger his fury is poured out like fire and the rocks are thrown down by him

9209100 having lost our opener at arsenal last week this was as good as it gets

9209103 estos hallazgos contradicen el estereotipo sobre las comunidades del nuevo mundo y el prejuicio de que lo que se encuentra en europa son ciudades y lo de fuera debe ser otra cosa su planeamiento y su organizaci n era absolutamente notables mayor que la de algunos ejemplos cl sicos
9209104 not surprisingly such a perspective is also often linked to an extremist end time obsession that acts as fertile ground for the planting watering and harvesting of all kinds of conspiracy theories related to such things as the anti christ the great apostasy and the so called coming one world government this is all very disturbing but god is in control

9209116 was really surprised at the architectural rehabilitation of the centre of the city ive never seen it so clean
9209117 but ive never seen it so deserted either in places it was like people had been vacuumed off the streets friends say that creative artists are returning musicians painters and writers but i dont think the city will ever be the same

9209119 das ist nicht gut ohne g ltige bahncard k nnen sie sich nicht ausweisen
9209120 ja und nun wie l sen wir das jetzt reicht ihnen mein perso um nachgucken zu k nnen das ich auch gl cklicher besitzer einer g ltigen bahncard bin
9209121 sie haben auch noch ber internet gebucht also die vorschriften besagen dass diese internetkarte nur mit bahncard g ltig ist die haben sie nicht
9209122 also habe ich sie ohne g ltigen fahrschein aufgegriffen das heisst sie fahren schwarz m ssen den zug an der n chsten haltestelle verlassen und strafe zahlen
9209123 moment ich habe eine fahrkarte gekauft und sofort ihrem kollegen bescheid gesagt dass ich eine verkehrte bahncard dabei habe
9209124 wie auch immer sie haben hier ein ung ltiges internetdingens ich habe ihnen gerade gesagt was ich nun tun m sste um uns g tlich zu einigen ich kann ihnen nur eine neue fahrkarte verkaufen ohne rabatt und ohne bahncarderm igung plus nachl seaufschlag plus doppelter preis bis zur n chsten haltestelle weil sie vom einstiegsort bis jetzt ohne g ltigen fahrschein bef rdert wurden
9209125 macht 149 euro die 59 euro f r das internetdingens kann ich aber nicht anrechnen zahlen sie bar
9209126 das kommt mir pro schicht ein dutzend mal unter und laut protokoll m sste ich ein dutzend mal leute wegen schwarzfahrerei belangen und aus dem zug werfen leute die ganz regul r ihren fahrschein bezahlt haben und die oft schon verzweifelt genug sind z b weil ihnen das portemonnaie in dem sich die bahncard befand gerade geklaut wurde deshalb verkaufen wir denen nur die schwarzfahrerkarte verzichten aber auf straferhebung und anzeige
9209127 sie l sen 25 zuschlag damit haben wir den normalpreis dann ist alles ok und es gibt keinen rger
9209128 sehen sie sicher haben sie den vollen preis bezahlt aber es fehlt immer noch der ausweis durch die bahncard ich m sste jetzt aber lassen wir das sie sind sicherlich froh wenn sie wieder zu hause sind oder

9209247 up to now the slightest criticism of radical islam on campus has been slammed as islamophobia while muslim groups and their radical fellow travelers have been allowed to say the most hateful things imaginable about christians and jews without any reaction from university administrators whatsoever
9209248 provost nikias has called the hadith on the msa website for what it is despicable given the atmosphere that prevails on most campuses today it was an act of integrity on his part to make this call and to demand that the msa live up to basic standards of civility that should govern the university

9209261 after the seventeenth centruy philosopher with a dim view of human nature
9209262 i use calvin as a way to comment on human nature
9209263 any moderately perceptive and reasonably honest observer of humanity has to acknowledge that we are remarkable prone to doing bad things and more disturbingly things we acknowledge to be wrong and when we add to this calculus the deeds we insist are justified even when the unanimous testimony of our friends and neighbors condemns us well the picture is anything but pretty
9209264 i dont know why were wired this way but we are
9209265 certainly nothing jolts us more rudely than the doctrine of original sin and yet but for this mystery the most incomprehensible of all we remain incomprehensible to ourselves

9209291 i recognize that the court ha snot ordered any classified information to be publicly disclosed nevertheless exceptionally grave damage to the national security reasonably could be expected to result if the cias deliberative review process for the disclosure of classified information is not followed during the habeas litigation
9209292 so for my part the mission is clear the next 67 days im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all if you want change in washington if you hope for a better america then were asking for your vote on the 4th of november
9209293 im very happy very happy today to spend my birthday with you and to make an historic announcement in dayton a city built on hard honest work of good people like the entire industrial midwest dayton has contributed much to the prosperity and progress of america
9209294 and now in these tough changing times after all youve done for our country you want your government to understand what youre going through to stand on your side and fight for you
9209295 my friends ive spent the last few months looking looking for a running mate who can best help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people that are counting on us
9209296 but i could only choose one and its with great pride and gratitude that i tell you i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who value their privileges over their responsibilities who put power over principle and put their interest before your needs
9209297 i found someone with an outstanding reputation for standing up to special interests and entrenched bureaucracies someone who has fought against corruption and the failed policies of the past someone who stopped government from wasting taxpayers money on things they dont want or need and put it back to work for the people someone with executive experience who has shown great tenacity and skill in tackling tough problems especially our dangerous dependence on foreign oil someone who reached across the aisle and asked republicans democrats and independents to serve in government someone with strong principles a fighting spirit and deep compassion someone who grew up in a decent hardworking middle class family whose father was an elementary school teacher and mother was the schools secretary
9209298 they taught their children to care about others to work hard and to stand up with courage for the things you believe in both of them were coaches too and raised their children to excel at sports and im sure they taught them skills that will surely come in handy over the next two months
9209299 the person im about to introduce to you was a union member and is married to a union member and understands the problems the hopes and the values of working people knows what its like to worry about mortgage payments and health care the cost of gasoline and groceries
9209300 shes not shes not from these parts and shes not from washington
9209301 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9209302 my friends and fellow americans i am very pleased and very privileged to introduce to you the next vice president of the united states governor sarah palin of the great state of alaska
9209303 and i thank you senator mccain and mrs mccain for the confidence that you have placed in me senator i am honored to be chosen as your running mate i will be honored to serve next to the next president of the united states
9209304 i know that when senator mccain gave me this opportunity he had a short list of highly qualified men and women and to have made that list at all it was a privilege
9209305 first there are a few people whom i would like you to meet i want to start with my husband todd and todd and i are actually celebrating our 20th anniversary today and i promised him a little surprise for the anniversary present and hopefully he knows that i did deliver
9209306 and then we have as after my husband who is a lifelong commercial fisherman lifetime alaskan hes a production operator
9209307 along the way todd and i have shared many blessings and four out of five of them are here with us today
9209308 next to todd is our daughter bristol another daughter willow our youngest daughter piper and over in their arms is our son trig a beautiful baby boy he was born just in april his name is trig paxson van palin
9209309 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case today
9209310 i was then appointed ethics commissioner and chairman of the alaska oil and gas conservation commission and when i found corruption there i fought it hard and i held the offenders to account
9209311 when oil and gas prices went up so dramatically and the state revenues followed with that increase i sent a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of alaska and we are now were now embarking on a 40 billion natural gas pipeline to help lead america to energy independence
9209312 i signed major ethics reforms and i appointed both democrats and independents to serve in my administration
9209313 well its always though safer in politics to avoid risk to just kind of go along with the status quo
9209314 now no one expects us to agree on everything whether in juneau or in washington but we are expected to govern with integrity and good will and clear convictions and a servants heart
9209315 now no leader in america has shown these qualities so clearly or presents so clear a threat to business as usual in washington as senator john s
9209316 and this is a moment that requires resolve and toughness and strength of heart in the american president
9209317 and im going to make sure nobody does forget that in his campaign there is only one candidate who has truly fought for america and that man is john mccain
9209318 this is a moment this is a moment when great causes can be won and great threats overcome depending on the judgment of our next president in a dangerous world it is john mccain who will lead americas friends and allies in preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
9209319 it was john mccain who cautioned long ago about the harm that russian aggression could do to georgia and to other small democratic neighbors and to the world oil markets
9209320 it was senator mccain who refused to hedge his support for our troops in iraq regardless of the political costs and you know what as the mother of one of those troops and as the commander of alaskas national guard thats the kind of man i want as our commander in chief
9209321 profiles in courage they can be hard to come by these days you know so often we just find them in books but next week when we nominate john mccain for president were putting one on the ballot
9209322 to serve as vice president beside such a man would be the privilege of a lifetime and its fitting that this trust has been given to me 88 years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9209323 i think as well today of two other women who came before me in national elections i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievements of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course senator hillary clinton who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign
9209324 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all

9209340 we have serious concerns about the way a lot of these animals are killed and we think anybody wearing fur sends the wrong message that its ok
9209341 public awareness of issues surrounding the fur trade is quite high these days and it would be hard to find many people who think its ok to wear fur in australia

9209344 oil companies arent even drilling whats already available oil companies are already sitting on 68 million acres of leases they arent even drilling instead of drilling there they just want to get their hands on the last places that are protected our natural treasures wildlife refuges and pristine coastlines

9209348 i am truly disappointed and disturbed to learn that a member of this administration contacted the department of public safety regarding trooper wooten
9209349 at no time did i authorize any member of my staff to do so
9209350 it is apparent that comments i made to a department of public safety official regarding trooper wooten improperly and incorrectly implied that i was acting on behalf of the governor and or her husband
9209351 at no time did either the governor or todd palin direct me or imply that i should try to influence any employee to have trooper wooten fired
9209352 in fact with the exception of the briefing with the governors security detail immediately after the election i have never discussed wooten with the governor
9209353 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9209354 shes fought oil companies and party bosses and do nothing bureaucrats and anyone who puts their interests before the people of whom she swore an oath to serve

9209373 i believe time management is important to make each day rewarding and productive but instead of focusing on how i can save a minute here a minute there i think about a different metric energy

9209378 from whence then this other pretence who are these deists how assume the name by what title or pretence the world the world say what how a modified lump matter motion what is all this substance what who knows why these evasions subterfuges with words definitions of things never to be defined structures or no foundations come to what is plain be plain for the idea itself is plain the question plain and such as everyone has invariably some answer to which it is decisive mind or not mind if mind a providence the idea perfect a god if not mind what in the place for whatever it be it cannot without absurdity be called god or deity nor the opinion without absurdity be called deism
9209379 familiarity of discourse if it can become a father to his son may much more be condescended to by a tutor to his pupil all their time together should not be spent in reading of lectures and magisterially dictating to him what he is to observe and follow hearing him in his turn and using him to reason about what is proposd will make the rules go down the easier and sink the deeper and will give him a liking to study and instruction and he will then begin to value knowledge when he sees that it enables him to discourse and he finds the pleasure and credit of bearing a part in the conversation and of having his reasons sometimes approvd and hearkend to particularly in morality prudence and breeding cases should be put to him and his judgment askd this opens the understanding better than maxims how well soever explaind and settles the rules better in the memory for practice this way lets things into the mind which stick there and retain their evidence with them whereas words at best are faint representations being not so much as the true shadows of things and are much sooner forgotten he will better comprehend the foundations and measures of decency and justice and have livelier and more lasting impressions of what he ought to do by giving his opinion on cases proposd and reasoning with his tutor on fit instances than by giving a silent negligent sleepy audience to his tutors lectures and much more than by captious logical disputes or set declamations of his own upon any question the one sets the thoughts upon wit and false colours and not upon truth the other teaches fallacy wrangling and opiniatry and they are both of them things that spoil the judgment and put a man out of the way of right and fair reasoning and therefore carefully to be avoided by one who would improve himself and be acceptable to others
9209380 nature has joined thee to such a body such as it is the supreme mind would have it that this should be the trial and exercis of inferior minds it has given thee thine not just at hand or as when they say into ones mouth not just in the way so as to be stumbled on by good luck not so easily either but so as thou mayst reach it so as within thy power within command see here are the incumbrances this is the condition the bargain terms is the prize worth contending for or what will become of me if i do not contend how if the stream carries me down how if wholly plunged in this gulf what will be my condition then what when given up to body when all body and not a motion not a thought not one generous consideration or sentiment besides

9209405 rapid cycle time increases learning tremendously eliminates buggy software because you die if you dont fix this fixes the install process because you die if you have to install 45 releases this year and install is not easy improves the upgrade process because there is a constant flow of upgrades that are mandatory makes upgrades easy forces quick standardization of software via new features rather than customization and one off forces implementation of sustainable pace you die a death of attrition without it allows waiting to build new functionality until there are 4 5 customers who pay for it this is counterintuitive and caused by the fact everything is ready within 90 days
9209406 i find that the vast majority of organizations are still trying to do too much stuff and thus find themselves thrashing the only organization i know of which has really solved this is patientkeeper

9209449 and the color of the circles you dance around it as you run in search of something that doesnt exist
9209450 when you look at this list and the list of companies that own the gdss you can quickly see that the majority of all travel product purchased by consumers today is controlled by only a few companies just how much competitive pricing can consumers expect when they are searching researching and comparing prices for products that are all distributed by the same companies as shocking as this may seem to the average consumer it is not information that is readily provided to consumers when they purchase online or through a travel agent even many travel agents are not aware of the incestuous relationships that exist within the industry

9209461 what would you like your legacy to the world to be
9209462 throw out a word like fibromyalgia and youll get this blank stare
9209463 there was a time when it was thought to be psychosomatic
9209464 we now understand the pain in fibromyalgia is an abnormality in the central nervous system in which pain sensations are amplified
9209465 i was seeing patients before because no one else wanted to see them
9209466 fibromyalgia typically is defined as unremitting pain in multiple areas of the body at least 11 of 18 specific tender points accompanied by fatigue difficulties wwith concentration and other vague physical discomforts
9209467 eventually everyone started doubting whether or not i was really in pain
9209468 my coach couldnt understand how i could play one day and be bedridden the next
9209469 with each passing year ive accepted the cards ive been dealt
9209470 the pain of fibromyalgia is not occurring because of some injury or inflammation of the muscles or joints
9209471 there is something wrong with the way the central nervous system is processing pain from the peripheral tissues its over amplifying the pain
9209472 people will think there must be a disease if there is a medicine for it it must be treatable
9209473 there is no recipe for treating fibromyalgia patients the treatments have to be fully individualized and that takes a lot of time

9209481 there are a lot of us who emotionally would love to do it
9209482 but its really chris call chris is the kind of filmmaker who just doesnt think about the next movie before he has completely finished the movie he is working on
9209483 when he comes back we will see how he feels
9209484 the ignorant must be taught the sick healed the sleepers awakened the child must not be oppressed or censured because it is undeveloped it must be patiently trained the sick must not be neglected because they are ailing nay rather we must have compassion upon them and bring them healing briefly the old conditions of animosity bigotry and hatred between the religious systems must be dispelled and the new conditions of love agreement and spiritual brotherhood be established among them
9209485 the challenge facing the religious leaders of mankind is this to contemplate with hearts filled with the spirit of compassion and a desire for truth the plight of humanity and to ask themselves whether they cannot in humility before their almighty creator submerge their theological differences in a great spirit of mutual forbearance that will enable them to work together for the advancement of human understanding and peace
9209486 if i wasnt so selfish and needing to be alone this never would have happened
9209487 oh shes beautiful she looks just like ryan when he was a baby thank goodness her earlobes arent attached like yours
9209488 its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
9209489 the future of a community a people a church and a nation depends on the children who will inherit it if we prevent our children from being born we remove ourselves from the future its really that simple no children no future
9209490 in the interview tom brokaw reminded you that the church professes the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death
9209491 unfortunately your statement demonstrates a lack of understanding of catholic teaching and belief regarding abortion
9209492 your erroneous claim about the history of the churchs opposition to abortion is false and denigrates our common faith
9209493 to reduce the scandal and consternation caused amongst the faithful by your remarks we necessarily write you to correct the public record and affirm the churchs actual and historical teaching that defends the sanctity of human life
9209494 conscience to the teaching of the church that goes back to the very beginning of the church on this moral issue
9209495 if you are ignorant and you dont know when life begins then you go on the side of safety and protecting rights you dont bomb a city where there might be a lot of civilians you say well im not sure well then be on the side of safety protect the lives of the innocent the non combatants
9209496 you must also go on the side of your ignorance to say then if i dont know then ill protect all the more
9209497 make sure not that there are few and rare abortions but that there are zero abortions and that you would do everything you can to protect life this is the duty of us all
9209498 unwed and abandoned mothers women facing unintended pregnancies and women struggling with the aftermath of an abortion
9209499 cleaning up with children around is like shoveling during a blizzard
9209500 the moment a child is born the mother is also born she never existed before the woman existed but the mother never a mother is something absolutely new
9209501 if evolution really works how come mothers only have two hands
9209502 we gather here today to remember those who fought in what sometimes has been referred to as the forgotten war
9209503 but let me assure you the sacrifices of those brave soldiers sailors airmen and marines are not forgotten
9209504 horrific battle with the chinese communist forces near the village of shindong ni
9209505 today we once again honor their memory whether they still rest in korea and remain achingly unaccounted for or whether they returned home decades ago
9209506 the bible says that rain is heavens tears that being so it is notable that gods tears are falling on us today
9209507 but we should see these as tears of joy first because 50 years ago god called home these two soldiers second because the remains of these soldiers are also finally going home
9209508 a nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors the men it remembers
9209509 it is fitting on the 48th anniversary of the signing of the armistice that this service member is finally going home
9209510 may we never forget these sacrifices made on behalf of freedom
9209511 we know that he was either a pilot or an aircrew member
9209512 but its very important to withhold the identity of the service member for the benefit of families back home until we get positive scientific identification

9209531 no me siento frustrado ni decepcionado porque hoy en d a creemos que es f cil fichar jugadores pero no lo es ni teniendo el dinero hay muchos factores que influyen que son dif ciles de controlar no es s lo el jugador sino su entorno que tambi n es dif cil de convencer
9209532 durante mucho tiempo hemos intentado varias cosas para ampliar la plantilla pero no ha podido ser lo hemos intentado y no ha salido aunque es verdad que siempre quieres mejorar al final lo importante es la base del equipo que tenemos los jugadores est n en un margen de mejora
9209533 me alegro por el depor que ha conseguido llegar a la uefa me gusta siempre enfrentarme al rival en su mejor momento te motiva y te preocupa m s no te dejas llevar por la relajaci n o porque le falten jugadores importantes le prefiero fuerte animado con su p blico es dif cil y lo prefiero
9209534 es un est mulo para nosotros para un equipo que siempre est obligado a ganar cada domingo se llame como se llame el rival es importante parar esa mala racha y conseguir una victoria
9209535 try not to let a day go by without doing something to bring you closer to your goal lets take the example of writing a book the idea of writing an entire book could prove daunting for some however if you decide that each day you will write just one page at the end of the year youll have a book consisting of 365 pages and so it is with any aspiration dont look at it as a whole think of it as a series of small bite size steps that you can take one at a time
9209536 lets just have a web presence everyone is going to continue to go to mls ca
9209537 i will i have been training for three months straight which of your feeble daoists will face me
9209538 tell me qufu is he in any way related to huang the professional swimmer the professional swimmer from your village

9209540 you have already disappointed me by wasting three months of valuable meditation time on pointless swimming the best you can hope for is to make me slightly less disappointed in you
9209541 it was like he was a professional swimmer how did he learn to swim so fast
9209542 the swimming technique that can be named is not the true swimming technique
9209543 i asked you to tell me the details of it
9209544 in dao the only motion is swimming the only useful quality the ability to swim
9209545 if you really believe in the saving power of jesus christ then why in the world would you show up at church every single sunday without a carload of people who need him
9209546 never mind that ive traveled to 30 plus countries in this world
9209547 when i need your body close i burn up in smoke and i swore id keep waiting
9209548 well i i dont know governor palin i have not met her before i had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and and wish her luck but not too much luck on the campaign trail and she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and a up and coming public servant
9209549 so it its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda and ultimately this is going to be about where i want to take the country and where joe biden wants to take the country and where john mccain and his running mate want to take the country

9209602 it is not about depending or not depending on a few players of course it is an achievement but you cannot just sit back on it and say we won the twenty20 world cup the tri series in australia or now here in sri lanka you have to continue doing it
9209603 if you have players like sachin and sehwag it really helps in doing and achieving these things consistently but it their absence is not really in control because at times you will have injuries
9209604 we didnt have ishant sharma we didnt have sachin and veeru sehwag who was in prime form but it is up to other individuals to take up the responsibility because there is no point in sitting and sulking about guys who are not there
9209605 they are the guys who are part of the 16 who can really make a difference and they were doing just that
9209606 but of course you miss individuals specially the great players

9209688 when i was in the snow and ice data center receiving a full briefing on the polar ice caps afterwards i would turn on my tv and there were two networks with the bulletin britney spears loses custody of her children were living in a madhouse if our priorities focus on the embalming of anna nicole smith or the trial of oj simpson while we ignore the greatest crisis this nation has ever faced global warming and climate change
9209689 with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short circuit the rule of law so why is this election so close
9209690 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion
9209691 there is no better example than the climate crisis as i have said for many years throughout this land were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization every bit of that has to change
9209692 oil company profits as you know have soared to record levels and gasoline prices have gone through the roof and we are more dependent than ever on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger military experts warn us that our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions
9209693 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
9209694 and it just so happens that the climate crisis is intertwined with the other two great challenges facing our nation reviving our economy and strengthening our national security the solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon based fuels
9209695 instead of letting oil lobbyists and polluters control our destiny we need to invest in american green technology innovation
9209696 almost a hundred years ago thomas edison our most famous inventor said
9209697 well now in 2008 we already have everything we need to use the sun the wind geothermal power conservation and efficiency to solve the climate crisis everything that is except a president in the white house who inspires us to believe
9209698 so how did this no brainer become a brain twister because the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth and this same industry has spent a half a billion dollars this year alone trying to convince the public they are actually solving the problem when they are in fact making it worse every single day this bush administration and the special interests big oil who control it lock stock and barrel after barrel have performed this same sleight of hand deceit lies on issue after issue some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
9209699 what is your take on global warming and how it is affecting our country
9209700 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location but im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9209701 this same industry big oil has spent a half a billion dollars this year alone on televison and newspaper advertising this is how big oil controls the mainstream media they fund it trying to convince the public they are actually solving the problem of climate change when they big oil are in fact making it worse climate change every single day
9209702 im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9209703 los recientes acontecimientos ocurridos durante la celebraci n de la sesi n extraordinaria del consejo general universitario el d a de ayer constituyen un hito culminante en una cadena de hechos que han generado la grave crisis que padece nuestra instituci n desde hace meses propiciada por la reiterada conducta il cita de quien hasta el d a de ayer encabez la administraci n y nuestro cuerpo de gobierno el c carlos brise o torres

9209709 the people are becoming more and more politically informed thanks to the alternative media
9209710 in malaysian politics you have the both the bn and opposition parties controlling 30 of the hardcore base vote and the 40 in the middle will determine victory and in permatang pauh he anwar solidly captured 70
9209711 there were two things that turned off voters in the recent by elections one was the sodomy allegations and the other was the playing up of racial sentiments the twin attacks on anwar did not hold water they actually backfired
9209712 with regards to why anwar gained chinese support despite a bn candidate fluent in chinese the chinese saw the message over the candidate bn tried to play a divide and rule game by portraying datuk arif shah omar shah as a pro chinese candidate on one hand while attacking anwar as a malay traitor
9209713 so no matter how proficient arif shah was at hokkien or mandarin it would not have helped
9209714 anwar has been consistent in his message for change to free the country from racial politics and corruption and that message has gone down well across communities the key factor was that people were frustrated with the status quo with bn politics and just wanted a change
9209715 no one believes in bn like they did before and there is a lack of trust in bn leaders umno has remained in a state of denial since march 8
9209716 the people are becoming more and more politically informed thanks to the alternative media they are insulting the intellectual voters by trying to use the media to play up their stories the bn governments thinking gap is far from the peoples their campaign strategy is a failure it is too out dated and it is just not working
9209717 the people want something but the bn gives a different thing those who believed that the bn government would do something to change their lives are probably upset
9209718 the ruling party could not answer or respond to all the questions put forth by opposition leaders anwars promise of a new hope for malaysia has somehow convinced many even some strong bn supporters
9209719 bn has also lost the confidence of the malays and non malays especially among the middle class group it failed to understand the peoples grievances and that is how they become silent voters
9209720 i am not denying that the bn government has contributed a lot in the past but the present leadership has failed to address the rakyats grievances
9209721 it needs to rebuild the confidence of the people in bn and its image stop all personal attacks on the opposition and show more transparency
9209722 it is a lie we are not goods items commodities that can be sold we are not that our stand is very clear and firm we are not going to move from bn
9209723 we are now preparing a formal pledge which will be initiated by all the sabah and sarawak bn mps we hope to present it to the prime minister over the next few days
9209724 the people had given their mandate to us to develop and make changes to the constituencies their trusts and belief in us cannot be traded
9209725 it is nothing new we reiterate that in the last four to five years when there was global pressure and economic slowdown the prime minister and barisan nasional bn were not able to provide new stimulus
9209726 the problem is that we have lost the competitive edge there are no new foreign direct investments fdis
9209727 the issue is not giving sweeteners to sabah sarawak and the poor because it does not commensurate with the big increase in inflation and high cost what is given does not alleviate the problem and sufferings of the poor
9209728 we continue to be in a state of denial we are not able to shift from the obsolete economic policy where there are rampant corruptions and fail to be more competitive because we are stuck with the old policies
9209729 i see no way where we can attract fdi without fdi malaysia cannot propel its economy and this unfortunately was not addressed
9209730 bismillahirrahmanirrahim i anwar ibrahim as an mp do hereby swear with all honesty that i will fulfill my duties honestly and will defend and protect the constitution
9209731 i was told by sources in rtm radio televisyen malaysia that it the live telecast will not begin until anwars swearing in finishes
9209732 everyone wanted me to take the oath so it is now done and i look forword to my role with my colleagues in parti keadilan rakyat pas and dap in parliament i am glad to be back after a decade
9209733 however there is no need to talk about it now we will inform about bn mps crossing over when the time is right
9209734 the people are becoming more and more politically informed thanks to the alternative media
9209735 in malaysian politics you have the both the bn and opposition parties controlling 30 of the hardcore base vote and the 40 in the middle will determine victory and in permatang pauh he anwar solidly captured 70
9209736 there were two things that turned off voters in the recent by elections one was the sodomy allegations and the other was the playing up of racial sentiments the twin attacks on anwar did not hold water they actually backfired
9209737 with regards to why anwar gained chinese support despite a bn candidate fluent in chinese the chinese saw the message over the candidate bn tried to play a divide and rule game by portraying datuk arif shah omar shah as a pro chinese candidate on one hand while attacking anwar as a malay traitor
9209738 so no matter how proficient arif shah was at hokkien or mandarin it would not have helped
9209739 anwar has been consistent in his message for change to free the country from racial politics and corruption and that message has gone down well across communities the key factor was that people were frustrated with the status quo with bn politics and just wanted a change
9209740 no one believes in bn like they did before and there is a lack of trust in bn leaders umno has remained in a state of denial since march 8

9209795 the new testament always reserves the word church ekklesia for the people of god it never uses this word to refer to a building of any sort
9209796 meeting in homes was a conscious choice of the early christians
9209797 these homes where the church met were never called temples
9209798 elevates the clergy to a position of prominence it puts the preacher at center stage separating and replacing him high above gods people
9209799 every building we encounter explicitly shows us what the church is and how it functions it teaches what is important and what is not
9209800 certain social locations can teach good and godly people very bad lessons and choke their lives together
9209801 most contemporary christians mistakenly view the church building as a necessary part of worship but real estate owned by institutional churches today is worth over 230 billion church building debt service and maintenance consumes about 18 percent of the 50 to 60 billion tithed to churches annually
9209802 more than 95 percent of its shared money for delivering ministry mission and outreach to the world

9209835 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
9209836 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
9209837 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
9209838 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world

9209876 thank god a muslim named obama came along who had studied in islamic schools in indonesia
9209877 our brother obama is ignorant of international politics because he said he would turn jerusalem into the eternal capital of the israelis i am hoping that this is just the propaganda of electioneering where politicians tell people what they think they want to hear but dont really intend to carry out those promises obama should have said he would insist on monitoring the israeli nuclear site dimona just like jfk did but he was probably afraid because jfk was killed after he said he would monitor dimona what brother obama needs to say is that he will implement the one state solution to return millions of displaced palestinian refugees to their homeland of palestine
