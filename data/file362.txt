3620223 it think what really stuck out to me was the significance of what went on in sunnyvale that many of us didnt even know about
3620224 onizuka was important for the safety and history of our country and the space program
3620225 you have lockheed moffet and onizuka all near there which really are defining parts of sunnyvale
3620226 determining whether or not was the mission control for the corona project is essential to determining its significance and eligibility the corona project is a significant piece of cold war history despite the fact that the cold war events are quire recent they are monumental in the scheme of american history

3620230 you must compete with men so that your number increases in parliament in order for you to come out with a law which can favour women at grass root levels so that they can developed at a faster rate
3620231 if you were many in parliament you would have passed so many bills such as domestic relation bill which has been pending in parliament
3620232 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3620233 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3620234 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3620235 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3620236 girls are not supposed to be actively seeking something a girl simply exists for someone to marry or divorce her
3620237 people who go for a picnic need to know each other a little longer than that let alone make a lifelong commitment
3620238 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3620239 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3620240 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3620241 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3620242 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3620243 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3620244 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3620245 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3620246 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3620247 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3620248 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3620249 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3620250 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3620251 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3620252 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3620253 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3620254 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3620255 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3620256 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3620257 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3620258 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3620259 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3620260 these three simple measures that would cost londons community charge payers nothing enormously assist cyclists and require absolutely no transport position papers
3620261 its very similar to last week against the swans when we were coming up against a side that was playing for a spot in the finals and we rose to the challenge then
3620262 the fact that its back home at subiaco puts a lot of pressure on st kilda with them knowing they didnt perform that well two weeks ago
3620263 st kilda has copped a bit of criticism this week and you also have to be wary of that specifically players that have been singled out
3620264 they are the ones that you have to be very careful of because they have a lot of pride and want to prove everyone wrong
3620265 well make sure that qantas responds appropriately that all the maintenance documentation relating to these aircraft has been checked and double checked
3620266 this is why we can put our head up and say that our safety standards are second to none
3620267 its brand you or canned you become distinct or extinct
3620268 our q2 financial performance was disappointing the desktop pc market around the world weakened during the quarter and our miscalculation of competitive price position further pressured our desktop gpu business we have a great product line up and having taken the necessary pricing actions we are strongly positioned again our focus now is to drive cost improvements and to further enhance our competitiveness through the many exciting initiatives we have planned for the rest of the year
3620269 in contrast the rest of our businesses did not exhibit the same dynamics as our desktop business the notebook gpu mcp and professional solutions groups grew a combined 27 percent year over year

3620289 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3620290 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3620291 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3620292 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3620293 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3620294 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3620295 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3620296 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3620297 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3620298 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3620299 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3620300 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3620301 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3620302 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3620303 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3620304 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3620316 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

3620418 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3620419 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission

3620423 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3620424 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3620425 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3620426 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3620427 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3620428 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3620429 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3620430 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3620431 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3620432 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3620433 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3620434 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3620435 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3620436 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3620437 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3620438 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3620439 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3620440 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3620441 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3620442 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3620443 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3620444 who are open to doing something on the production side
3620445 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3620446 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3620447 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3620448 if you were wondering if michael phelps is good enough to do it with his eyes closed the answer is apparently yes

3620450 lulu is what you might call a super stud many times a panda pop
3620451 my knee jerk response right now is that maybe its time that we reassess a special session
3620452 its still a preliminary number that rather than the 392 million dollars of new money were down in the 125 million range
3620453 the rebate issue very well could be out the window on that

3620474 youre from that place where everyone is blonde right i love your country the people here arent like the people there you are so much more liberal there is not so much discrimination
3620475 what city are you from are there any foreign people like people from other countries in your city
3620476 here there are neighborhoods where you shouldnt go because people will look at your skin and equate you with money
3620477 here the families are very big have you noticed people get married and start having children when they are very young young people are never virgins in argentina
3620478 also husbands hit their wives not all of them not all the time i wouldnt but i know couples i have friends who hit their girlfriends and their wives its common but mostly in those poor neighborhoods
3620479 but really its ok if i hold your hand sometimes people just need to enjoy a moment they dont need to talk any more i know you well enough and i dont need to know anything else
3620480 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3620481 what do you think about what happened with the twin towers do you think they were a part of bushs plan for the united states to gain control over the world
3620482 um do you mean do i think bush did it
3620483 yes i do i hate bush here everybody hates bush and we dont believe anything he says i think that he came into office with a plan to convince everyone that the us had to invade the middle east to get the money and the oil or whatever i think that the twin towers was a conspiracy and he was behind it for sure everything he says is a lie
3620484 no that is simply not true there is no way that it could be true
3620485 the reasons for invading iraq involved a lot of complicated politics and a lot of money
3620486 yes and iraq is such a terrible disaster he has killed so many people so many innocent families have died and he doesnt care bush just wants to go in and kill everybody that gets in his way so that the united states can rule everything he is the devil just like hitler he planned everything with the twin towers because he doesnt care about people
3620487 okay i do think that bush lied and did not tell us the real reasons for invading iraq and the twin towers attacks and the fear of terrorism were useful excuses that he used i think the reasons he gave to us were over simplified and ridiculous i disagree with a lot of what we have done in iraq and i hate that so many innocent people are dying but bush did not plan the attack on the twin towers that is just not possibly true

3620500 from the standard notice they send out when they suspend a blog it seems that someone has complained about the content
3620501 the two most likely causes seem to be that someone is claiming copyright infringement or libel
3620502 of course i understand that they blogger dont want to be hosting illegal content but it seems a bit unfair that they can shut down the uks most popular advertising blog without explaining the nature of the allegation

3620524 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3620525 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3620526 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3620527 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3620528 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3620529 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

3620587 in the run up to the olympics it seems that chinese authorities are so obsessed with projecting an image of stability and harmony that they have really come down quite hard on human rights activists and lawyers
3620588 the chinese authorities have used the olympics and the cleanup before the olympics as an excuse to maintain and extend a draconian detention system that they had called re education through labor
3620589 what that really means is that theyre punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the chinese government have instead been rounded up
3620590 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
3620591 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
3620592 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few web sites that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
3620593 chinas political reality is a place where no freedom of expression will really be allowable this goes for the chinese people and the foreign journalists
3620594 china is always afraid that if it lets its own people speak freely and spontaneously organize by itself the chinese communist party could be endangered or even be threatened
3620595 they also feel since they got the olympics the world is coming anyway by this point they can just do what they want and just let the world tolerate rather than have to fundamentally change their own behavior
3620596 beijings public air quality reporting has been a misinformation campaign
3620597 this is really a significant opportunity lost for the chinese government to show to the world that they really trust their own people a sign of a china that is ready to take its place in the first ranks in the nations of the world

3620607 on behalf of the village council and all the families clans and homesteads it represents i would like to welcome you
3620608 i have been informed that you arrived to our village just this morning i have also been told that you bring with you sixty weapon bearing men of age to assist you in killing the foul beast
3620609 our weaponthanes and errol no nose were mighty warriors and the monster killed them all in a day
3620610 from what i heard your weaponthanes and errol no nose were pussies actually
3620611 and whats more i hear that they couldnt drink to save their lives
3620612 erm with the greatest respect to the fallen of course
3620613 is that we have brought with many good weapon hands sixty of them all told as well as ox myself and two great hunters rudman and horace
3620614 we believe in these men they are of hardy stock and used to danger they arrive tomorrow and will not let you down we have the mighty storm god orlanth on our side and he has blessed us i predict a great success
3620615 together with the might of storming winds of orlanth at our side we will not fail
3620616 do this kill the chaos beast in the eastern woods with your men and friends and we will speak more and though i have great faith in orlanth i do not see how you are more favored than our own weaponthanes and warriors
3620617 theyve got a handful of farm hands and the rest are women and children theyll never make it through the winter
3620618 you mean we ll never make it through the winter
3620619 not that itll really matter though because were all about to be eaten by the fucking monster in the eastern woods whatever the fuck it is
3620620 bah dont worry about it the guys will be coming through in the morning with 60 good strong men well take care of the thing in the woods no problem and then the guys will all throw their weight in and turn this village around
3620621 do you honestly think that we will survive the battle

3620720 nanotechnology is a great example it has the potential to advance medicine agriculture health and environmental science and provide great benefits to society but there may be safety concerns related to the special properties of nanoparticles such as their greater abilities to penetrate and move across organs and cells in biological systems
3620721 the u s oversight system currently relies on agencies and regulations designed for related technologies but they are not equipped to adequately handle the novel properties and unique challenges associated with nanotechnology in fact oversight issues associated with applications for agriculture and food remain largely unexplored
3620722 to meet the needs and values of all stakeholders involved we must consider new technologies from a variety of perspectives for example some stakeholders are more concerned about the economic benefits of new technology while others care primarily about the health and environmental impact
3620723 our goal was to develop a multidisciplinary approach to more comprehensively evaluate oversight systems for emerging technologies
3620724 we anticipate that this new approach will be a valuable tool for analyzing multiple perspectives features outcomes and tradeoffs of oversight systems
3620725 such an approach that incorporates the viewpoints of key disciplines and the perspectives of multiple stakeholders could help to ameliorate controversy and conflict as new technologies emerge and oversight systems for them are considered and deployed

3620735 what id say to the commercial banks is this if youre registering in these economic circumstances a 7 per cent increase in profit and im all for our companies being profitable its a part and parcel of the market economy
3620736 but if youre a bank generating significant profits and commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families where working australians are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers

3620852 other industry figures show a decrease of over a million litres of spirits combining the decrease in alcopops with the small increase in straight spirits a decline overall of 1 1 million litres of pure alcohol consumed

3620865 a stronger and sharper focus on talent senior executives need to take this responsibility personally by devoting significant and highly visible time to talent rather than assigning the problem solely to human resources hr and they must apply as much rigor and intensity to recruiting developing retaining and allocating talent as they do to financial planning
3620866 do it yourself development since the tight talent market routinely fails to provide candidates who have the right skills and leadership qualities leading companies build training and development programs and put them at the center of hiring and retention
3620867 turning challenges into opportunities top companies turn this challenge into an opportunity by using major initiatives as a chance to develop new leaders from within and to bring experienced leaders recruited from the outside up to speed more systematically this approach does require a willingness to give relatively inexperienced people responsibility for major initiatives but can also help companies to develop leaders and capabilities more quickly to be effective talent management must be integrated tightly with other elements of a companys operations and organization including its corporate culture and hr processes employees expect a companys stated mission values and talent policies to hang together consistently companies that value entrepreneurship highly should reward it highly for example this kind of alignment is a distinct challenge in a market where many employees including managers are relatively new to the companies they serve

3620914 to compete internationally ireland needs high levels of achievement in science and technology and to realise this a sea change in how we teach how we resource and how we deal with these courses is needed
3620915 maths opens the door to many exciting opportunities in the technology sector
3620916 for the past number of years the high failure rate in maths and the small numbers choosing to take higher level has made the headlines
3620917 it is time to stop posturing and tackle the problem head on radical solutions must be introduced immediately
3620918 these areas offer qualifications which are in high demand with good career prospects and they are critically important in supporting the growth of high value knowledge based industries in ireland
3620919 the range of options available for students leaving school this year is enormous and between third level courses and the vast array of plc and other education and training opportunities there is something out there for everyone

3620922 peaches and max drummey are delighted to announce their very happy marriage the couple tied the knot in a simple low key ceremony in las vegas last week whilst holidaying in america
3620923 peaches and max did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts
3620924 when peaches went out to the us im not sure she planned to get married she just wanted to spend some more time with max
3620925 they have been together since the itunes festival but not many people knew about it only their close circle of friends and family
3620926 peaches dad knew about the wedding and he is perfectly happy

3620935 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3620936 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3620937 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3620938 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3620939 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3620940 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3620941 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3620942 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3620943 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3620944 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3620945 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3620946 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3620947 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3620948 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3620949 they looked at both those incidents around the time they occurred and worked on specific plans to address those issues
3620950 everybody assumed from the beginning that it would come out of the states education budget
3620951 its money they should have been giving to the schools all along
3620952 the remaining chapter in this case at least at this point is in the hands of the general assembly
3620953 i agree this could feel like terrorism especially if youre standing in front of a jeep thats heading toward you trying to kill you
3620954 as we have investigated this weve come more and more to the conclusion that this was one individual acting alone in a criminal act
3620955 he didnt kill anybody he injured some people so its hard to say
3620956 its a democratic artwork everybody is going to come in and theyre all going to walk across the floor
3620957 look at the opening ceremony of the olympics do we say so what
3620958 certainly you dont have to have this on the floor and you can be totally utilitarian but if you can have something of beauty that people can derive pleasure from then why not
3620959 some felt that the town should not be engaged in funding non critical services and some felt that public art was as vital as parks and recreation
3620960 i am a big supporter of it as long as its in public areas and visible and able to be used in the public
3620961 people start to recognize the design and quality and how they see the town changes
3620962 it adds to the cultural network of the town art shouldnt be elitist and its not a mystery
3620963 this is what we have kellen to do win this game
3620964 dude i cant stop thinking about it you just gotta let it go itll feel better after awhile and im sure somebody will tell you that youll be better for the experience
3620965 the opportunity for our employees customers distributors suppliers and most importantly our patients to benefit from being part of the csl family is exciting
3620966 at the same time the transaction represents a good return for our shareholders many of whom are our employees
3620967 especially if there have been preliminary talks with a potential buyer it is a means to put pressure on the buyer and increase the purchase price
3620968 anne told me those are called intrusive thoughts she was calm and cool
3620969 its either psychosis like andrea yates who drowned her five children in the bathtub or its just the baby blues
3620970 just knowing that youre not the only one helps so much
3620971 if federal charges appear to be more appropriate they could supplant the state charges
3620972 we felt like we needed to make sure that everything was left in an appropriate manner
3620973 you cant have it in your truck because you were going to practice after school
3620974 we dont want to frighten people and say that you can now have guns in wake county schools you cant

3620989 this ranking acknowledges our work to keep costs low while maintaining our high quality degree programs
3620990 there is currently a significant shortage of engineers in the united states and an investment in online higher education will help to insure job security in these challenging economic times
3620991 higher education doesnt have to break the bank and with this ranking consumers and employers can be confident that pursing a distance engineering graduate degree at colorado state will be a wise financial decision
3620992 when education is more affordable it is more accessible and thats what distance education is all about

3621002 to that end it was agreed that representatives who have attended the latest briefings and demonstrations in lahore and karachi will visit stakeholders who have expressed reservations to let them know of the safety and security measures on the ground
3621003 the results of those meetings will be fed back to me and also to icc vice president sharad pawar and icc ceo lorgat on august 20 so we can make a further assessment of the comfort levels of our participating members
3621004 we are committed to a safe and secure champions trophy we believe these visits and the feedbacks will play a major role in achieving those ends
3621005 during the recently completed asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt allow us opportunity to check the security arrangements so there has been no way for us to formulate an opinion on the venue
3621006 we believe that by excluding rawalpindi and using just two venues both of them successful hosts during asia cup it will remove doubt allow a further concentration of resources and improve comfort levels for all stakeholders in the event visit to pakistan has allowed task team to deal in reality instead of theories or perceptions

3621025 there is no future for these talks unless the facilitator mbeki is able to come forward with proposals that demonstrate a change in mugabes position
3621026 the pressure only went one way on tsvangirai and he had no proposals to break the logjam

3621031 bunbury is the most marginal seat in western australia so with that in mind im not confident but im up for the challenge
3621032 bunbury has always been my focus ive lived here for 54 years and have an in depth knowledge of local issues
3621033 we were expecting if there was an early election that it would be called after the cabinet meeting which we have used to present our election bids
3621034 that decision has left bunbury without the opportunity to have its moment in the sun
3621035 the situation is that when the election was called everything went on hold and thats how it goes
3621036 bunbury has only ever so slightly gone labor by just under one per cent but i still expect to see liberals to hold on because the sitting member has had three years to build his profile
3621037 this will be a bonus for him because hes been campaigning in a longer term way
3621038 castrilli will be happy to be viewed as a liberal independent and campaign based on his local credentials
3621039 even though the boundary changes on the figures favour labor the sitting member as a former mayor is well placed
3621040 i have no doubt it would attract a major department store to bunbury in due course
3621041 we have spoken to some of the majors in the past and i believe at least one of them is interested in coming to bunbury
3621042 although not popular with some people i am delighted because i believe very much it is in the best interest of bunbury
3621043 the report also indicated that those retailers would not lose out if bunbury traded on sunday because business would pick up from the growing number of local shoppers
3621044 ive always felt as though bunbury was asleep and this will wake the whole town up

3621055 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people

3621110 placebos can affect patients response to pain therapy and also influence the results of clinical trials we have shown that responses to experimental placebos alter how the brain responds to pain and also that responses to experimental placebos persist in repeated testing in healthy volunteers
3621111 this allows us to measure how the brains pain control system is activated under different conditions we hope this study will help us understand how the brain deals with pain it is also likely to lead to development of new painkilling therapies and better ways of testing them

3621122 i agree this could feel like terrorism especially if youre standing in front of a jeep thats heading toward you trying to kill you
3621123 as we have investigated this weve come more and more to the conclusion that this was one individual acting alone in a criminal act

3621136 maybe i havent looked into it deep enough but if youre talking about a country where theres no golf courses and golfs an expensive game to take up i dont see how having it as an olympic sport is going to change anything
3621137 with how the schedules go for guys i dont know how theyll fit it in obviously this week is the olympics and they just had the pga what are they going to change the date of a major
3621138 i think you have to go one of two ways you either have to get the best u s professional players or you get the best amateur players one of the two
3621139 i dont think it would work well if its like the world cup has been the last couple times where guys dont want to go play so you dont have the top ranked players at the time going i dont think that would be any good

3621144 these big trucks and suvs are really dinosaurs at this point
3621145 consumers like suvs they havent fallen out of love with the things that made them popular but its just become an issue of economics when you look at paying several hundred dollars a month more in fuel that becomes a big deal for most households
3621146 they looked at both those incidents around the time they occurred and worked on specific plans to address those issues

3621153 some felt that the town should not be engaged in funding non critical services and some felt that public art was as vital as parks and recreation
3621154 i am a big supporter of it as long as its in public areas and visible and able to be used in the public
3621155 people start to recognize the design and quality and how they see the town changes
3621156 it adds to the cultural network of the town art shouldnt be elitist and its not a mystery

3621163 after that first inning when they had us down 10 0 i think everybody in the ballpark and everybody in all of massachusetts thought that the game was over
3621164 i threw the ball a lot better than the linescore said
3621165 if they didnt quit tuesday i dont think theyre ever going to quit
3621166 we expected dunn to solidify the middle of the order and take some pressure off the other guys
3621167 he did that and solidified the four hole in the lineup
3621168 im having a tough time right now but ill battle through it just like anybody else
3621169 im just going to grind out and keep trying to make my pitches you cant really stress about it and try harder because it will just get worse
3621170 its strange when it happens but obviously you have to find a way to win the game
3621171 it didnt go foul so we have to battle and preserve the tie game
3621172 delmon hitting the big three run homer that was pretty doggone exciting
3621173 its just unfortunate that we couldnt come up with another run after that

3621178 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3621179 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3621180 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins

3621183 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3621184 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3621185 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3621186 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3621187 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3621188 you make me nervous when you look around like that
3621189 you make me nervous everytime i look at you i begin to fall then i look away to prevent a crash

3621193 this is a scandal one on a par with the tainted blood scandal
3621194 we consider ourselves a generous society so we really have to wonder why there arent more organ donors

3621231 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one

3621252 but i have asserted a firm conviction a conviction rooted in my faith in god and my faith in the american people that working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds and that in fact we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union
3621253 this was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this campaign to continue the long march of those who came before us a march for a more just more equal more free more caring and more prosperous
3621254 what i did interpret was her hillary believing that the intricacies of the legislative process were somehow more significant than when ordinary people rise up and march and go to jail and fight for justice
3621255 not just with words but with deeds by investing in our schools and our communities by enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system by providing this generation with ladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations
3621256 in japan people are expected to live with tatemae which is what you show in public and honne which is who you really are in private
3621257 the two are separate things and the two realities rarely cross over or comment on each other
3621258 so sufferers just turn inward sinking ever deeper until the end
3621259 even now there are very few counseling or public awareness programs dealing with this problem in fact one strong fear among japanese is that talking about suicide with youngsters might actually prompt them to be suicidal
3621260 youre a shinigami so you see lots of people as they die thats the reason you can say death is nothing special but for those of us who are alive its very important
3621261 once upon a time in china a guide to the cinemas of hong kong taiwan and mainland china
3621262 a lot of aspects of the senators story will be recognizable to many asian americans
3621263 he talks about feeling like somewhat of an outsider about coming to terms with his self identity about figuring out how to reconcile the values from his unique heritage with those of larger u s society these are tensions and conflicts that play out in the lives of all children of immigrants
3621264 african americans think and rightfully so that this is a guy who understands their experience but its similar if you talk to latinos and asian americans or to our 22 year old field organizers people see in him the qualities they want to see
3621265 its amusing watching people come up with these caricatures suggesting hes not american
3621266 his story is the quintessential american story its the story that our nation is all about
3621267 people of every ethnic background write to me to say thats exactly my family and im not even filipino
3621268 people whove never given me the time of day before are contacting me for meetings
3621269 i mean the networks are all desperate to get traction on the internet so theyre calling up and saying how can we work with you its unreal
3621270 whenever my relatives get married im the one that edits the wedding videos
3621271 i had an agent i went on auditions i did the whole route of trying to fit into other peoples ideas of what i could do
3621272 and that apparently meant being the token asian woman in industrial training films heres how to put on safety goggles that sort of thing i was basically a warm body put in for diversity purposes i never felt like i was building a career or given the chance to stretch my wings creatively
3621273 i still had this desperate need to express myself as an artist
3621274 and i thought well all my life my family has asked me to do these imitations of them whenever we all get together after we pig out and everyones fat and bored theyll say christine get up there do your imitation of auntie and i realized that i really wanted to tell these little stories about my family whether there was an audience for them or not so i started shooting and editing these videos and uploading them to youtube not knowing if anyone was even watching felt kind of liberating in fact i realized i could just do whatever i wanted
3621275 people always congratulate me about how the success of happyslip is opening all these doors for me
3621276 but you know i dont watch tv anymore and i dont really go to movies youtube is really my media of choice and i treasure it because where else could you as an artist have this kind of an intimate connection with your audience im open to expanding into other opportunities but ill never give up youtube ive never seen it as a stepping stone to get somewhere else
3621277 i decided to write the song out of pure boredom and a gust of creativity
3621278 a few months later it got featured out of nowhere and then over the course of a few days i got hundreds of requests
3621279 these days if youre an artist and you dont have a youtube account youre doing something wrong
3621280 youtube is a great way to attract new listeners and promote your music ill continue to make videos as long as the people keep asking for them and watching
3621281 i still spend an hour a day on the site watching videos
3621282 when youre not asian a stands for awesome but when youre asian a stands for average b stands for bad c stands for crap d stands for dead f f stands for f ed
3621283 i talk about being asian because its who i am and the majority of my subscribers are asian because they relate to what im talking about and they back me up i think its natural to be attracted to and be more comfortable around people of your community
3621284 i get it i know its because asians never used to have anyone in the media to relate to
3621285 but now asians go online all the time asians dominate the internet and we pretty much dominate youtube
3621286 online its crazy i get tons of feedback from people a lot of oh love your stuff youre so cool people treat me like im an a list celeb which is ridiculous
3621287 but in person i go to a public school with 2 500 other people and my friends all know who i was before i started making these videos and they see me as who i am just kevin
3621288 you see that young asian americans are gravitating to youtube and its clear that they represent an underserved market thats thriving online outside the confines of hollywood and madison avenue
3621289 there have not been a lot of mainstream media choices for asian youth these artists are changing that there are no more hurdles for those who have ever said they were not given a chance or that doors were closed to them for whatever reason those days are over
3621290 once upon a time in china a guide to the cinemas of hong kong taiwan and mainland china
3621291 if heterosexual white male patriarchy and what it did in the world were not so powerful i think it would be fair to say that asian american women and men would be out dating or out marrying at similar rates and that we wouldnt elevate whites denigrate ourselves or worry about whether were sexually and personally worthy of others to nearly the same extent that we do now
3621292 but aznlovers real mission is to help debunk the common stereotypes associated with asian males to provide community between people with similar issues questions and curiosities and to foster interaction between females of all races and asian males so that they realize that yes they too are sought after items
3621293 wed just become engaged and i was looking for other women in my situation to gain insight and even support for the challenges that might arise from marrying into a different culture
3621294 i joined the site to find like minded individuals who understood my love of asian men
3621295 in the process i feel like ive grown a lot as a person ive learned from many peoples experiences in travel and relationships ive learned more about different cultures and i feel like ive made a difference in helping people cross boundaries that most people dont discuss and arent even aware of
3621296 my vast knowledge of the asian male was based on john hughes movies and influenced by the regional racism toward japanese at the time so id already made my decision regarding asian men i just wasnt attracted to them
3621297 but fast forward to the near present what started as a friendship with a chinese male grew into love one day it all came flooding out we admitted to each other that the pull was there god i love that day
3621298 i love the fact that people on the site acknowledge the beauty in asian men
3621299 society still makes women feel self conscious about saying they like asian features or particularly asian guys so even if they do they wont let their attraction out in public at aznlover we all know why were there we share a common bond in that one group has the qualities physical and otherwise that the other appreciates
3621300 theres a type of privilege in being sexually desirable but that can come at a cost
3621301 asian women have been dehumanized by being put on a pedestal and im wary of the same thing happening to asian men some guys may roll their eyes and say itll take a long time to get to that point but theres a fine line you have to tread in not trading one set of racist assumptions for another
3621302 i do find it disturbing that some of the more extreme views ive seen are focused less on social equality than on asian men attaining the same set of privileges as white males whom they see as having the pick of women
3621303 i think asian men are brainwashed to want white women and its too bad because im attracted to asian men and i think black female asian male couples are beautiful its messed up that many asian american men dismiss women of other races but they see stereotypes of black women in the media and they see white women depicted as glamorous so thats what they think is right for them
3621304 time for the asian american male community to get down with the brown
3621305 my inspiration for the post was a friend back in chicago who was always completely against dating anyone who wasnt black period
3621306 id invite her to parties and because my friends are such a diverse bunch of people shed always ask me first well are any men whom id want to date going to be there which was a code word for black men anyway she called me up and began the conversation guess what i have a new boyfriend and hes chinese and it really got me thinking hey if even karens doing it maybe shes on to something maybe were seeing the beginnings of a trend
3621307 as the number of available asian women and black men declines the asian man is left without a pool of wife material the black woman is in the same category it is only natural that the two should seek each other out to form a loving relationships
3621308 outside of the anglosphere north america england australia and new zealand things are completely different asian men are in general seen as dateable sexy and interesting most of the world has their own media in their own languages and subtleties and hollywoods attempts to spread stereotypes about asian men and their sexuality literally stops at the anglospheres edge simply because the rest of the world doesnt understand it and doesnt care
3621309 i think people overthink and overanalyze the nature of romance
3621310 i grew up in a little 200 person town in missouri where there wasnt an asian person for hundreds of miles
3621311 i first encountered the loving case purely by accident i was googling something unrelated and it came up i couldnt believe i had never heard of it i was a good student yet i never learned about it in school and to me the case was up there with brown v board of ed the laws that loving v virginia struck down could have easily prevented my own existence
3621312 things are getting better for interracial couples and multiracial individuals
3621313 however social acceptance might not matter that much to you if your best friend or your mother is threatening to cut you out of their lives we hear a lot of those stories racism against couples often occurs behind closed doors the loving day project is about counteracting the prejudice you might not immediately see
3621314 once upon a time in china a guide to the cinemas of hong kong taiwan and mainland china
3621315 there are 100 million videos being watched on youtube and 65 000 new clips are being uploaded each day so getting attention to this thing has taken a lot of effort
3621316 most americans have a complete sense of ennui with tv now and the japanese approach just grabs peoples attention thats why networks and studios are snapping up japanese formats as quickly as they can
3621317 id like to take the opportunity to thank the internet for my job
3621318 now that everyone and their grandma has net access youre seeing pop culture shared from places all around the world twenty five million people have already checked out this show virally in the u s and thats an incredible head start
3621319 dont sell it short though theres a lot going on in that 30 second bite
3621320 think of it as a comedy in three parts first the wall is revealed with its funny cutout shape and that gets a laugh then theres the deer in the headlights look of panic on the contestant and then theres the moment of impact where the player either gets through the hole or smashes into the wall you can see the whole thing play out on peoples faces you dont even need to turn up the volume
3621321 this show matches the zeitgeist once upon a time people would tune in to shows like dallas every week and theyd wait with bated breath to find out who killed j r but thats just too much of a commitment for people now these days were just looking for a break we want a very easy to watch knee jerk experience that gets us away from the blackberry for a few minutes
3621322 most of it was pretty typical dancing singing interviews blackout skits
3621323 but it also had segments where they broadcast hilarious home videos and my instinct was dump everything else and keep the videos
3621324 in americas funniest when we challenge viewers to send us video on a specific topic we get over 5 000 responses a show we asked for funny ways to crack an egg and the one that blew us away showed a 757 taxiing toward the camera until the front wheel rolls right up to an egg and cracks it thats how resourceful the american public can be
3621325 never underestimate the desire for americans to get on tv
3621326 in america however pride has to be followed by a paycheck if theres anything that reality shows have taught us its that americans will do anything for a chance at 250 000
3621327 because the contestants are generally celebrities and the prizes are minimal
3621328 you have this situation where participants arent playing to win theyre playing not to lose and when they do lose they lose in as big and funny a way as possible theres no mean spiritedness no real humiliation people arent emotionally scarred when the programs over maybe physically scarred but everyone who participates just sees it as simple goofy fun
3621329 when it came out i saw it as spoofing japanese game shows not mocking asians in fact if its making fun of anyone its non asians and celebrities theyre the ones who are being forced to do all of these silly stunts and i know were going to get heat on this but the shows hilarious and if theres any time we could put in on the air and any place we could air it its now and its here
3621330 to me this channel is about urban youth culture it should stand side by side with mtv
3621331 asian pop is a dynamic part of the youth experience it comes from a unique place with specific meaning to asian americans but it has a broader appeal its the nintendo wii its kung fu panda its japanese game shows thats the play here were not just the first 24 hour channel for asian americans but for asian pop culture
3621332 hey if there was ever a time to take chances now is it
3621333 no one wants to go out on a limb once theyre successful because they have too much to lose luckily we dont have that problem right now so lets just go for it whats there to be worried about at least we took a shot
3621334 once upon a time in china a guide to the cinemas of hong kong taiwan and mainland china
3621335 a lot of aspects of the senators story will be recognizable to many asian americans
3621336 he talks about feeling like somewhat of an outsider about coming to terms with his self identity about figuring out how to reconcile the values from his unique heritage with those of larger u s society these are tensions and conflicts that play out in the lives of all children of immigrants
3621337 i spent the rest of the day in a daze the novelty of having me in the class quickly wore off for the other kids although my sense that i didnt belong continued to grow most of my classmates had been together since kindergarten they lived in the same neighborhoods in split level homes with swimming pools their fathers coached the same little league teams their mothers sponsored the bake sales nobody played soccer or badminton or chess and i had no idea how to throw a football in a spiral or balance on a skateboard
3621338 tv movies the radio pop culture was color coded after all
3621339 i began to notice that cosby never got the girl on i spy that the black man on mission impossible spent all his time underground i noticed that there was nobody like me in the sears roebuck christmas catalog and that santa was a white man
3621340 have i told you that your brothers and sister have also excelled in their schooling
3621341 barry you do not work as hard as you should
3621342 the senator often talks about the importance of education the value of hard work and the need for a sense of personal responsibility
3621343 that resonates with a lot of asian americans who feel theyve pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and understand the notion that what we accomplish in life is in large part a measure of who we are as people and how hard we strive
3621344 african americans think and rightfully so that this is a guy who understands their experience but its similar if you talk to latinos and asian americans or to our 22 year old field organizers people see in him the qualities they want to see
3621345 its amusing watching people come up with these caricatures suggesting hes not american
3621346 hes not only american his story is the quintessential american story its the story that our nation is all about
3621347 once upon a time in china a guide to the cinemas of hong kong taiwan and mainland china
3621348 you see lots of people as they die thats the reason you say death is nothing special
3621349 but for those of us who are alive its very important
3621350 most americans have a complete sense of ennui with tv now and the japanese approach just grabs peoples attention thats why networks and studios are snapping up japanese formats as quickly as they can
3621351 id like to take the opportunity to thank the internet for my job
3621352 now that everyone and their grandma has net access youre seeing pop culture shared from places all around the world twenty five million people have checked out this show in the u s and thats an incredible head start
3621353 once upon a time people would wait with bated breath to find out who killed j r but thats just too much of a commitment now we just want a very easy to watch experience that gets us away from the blackberry for a few minutes
3621354 in americas funniest when we challenge viewers we get over 5 000 responses we asked for funny ways to crack an egg and the one that blew us away showed a 757 taxiing toward the camera until the front wheel rolls right up to an egg and cracks it thats how resourceful the american public can be
3621355 in america pride has to be followed by a paycheck if theres anything reality shows have taught us its that americans will do anything for a chance at 250 000
3621356 in japan the contestants are generally celebrities and the prizes are minimal
3621357 so you have this situation where participants arent playing to win theyre playing not to lose and when they do lose they lose in as big and funny a way as possible theres no mean spiritedness people arent emotionally scarred when the programs over maybe physically scarred but everyone just sees it as simple goofy fun
3621358 all my life my family has asked me to do these imitations of them whenever we all get together after we pig out and everyones fat and bored theyd say christine get up there do your imitation of auntie so i realized that i really wanted to tell these little stories about my family whether there was an audience for them or not and i started shooting and editing these videos and uploading them to youtube not knowing if anyone was even watching felt kind of liberating in fact i realized i could just do whatever i wanted
3621359 saying thats exactly my family and im not even filipino
3621360 i dont feel alienated i talk about being asian because its who i am and the majority of my subscribers are asian because they relate to what im talking about and they back me up
3621361 you see that young asian americans are gravitating to youtube and its clear that they represent an underserved market thats thriving online outside the confines of hollywood and madison avenue
3621362 there are no more hurdles for those who have ever said they were not given a chance or that doors were closed to them for whatever reason those days are over

3621368 we are seeing a softening or a tempering or some slowing of revenue growth in particular in financial markets but its not nearly to the level that people have been worrying about
3621369 people were thinking we would go negative growth in the second half but all the businesses are quite positive the picture the way i see it is a slight slowing in keeping with the general economy which is slowing down but not the sort of falling out of bed we are seeing in media or some of the banking sector
3621370 people are feeling a little better than they did a few weeks ago but thats fragile and that could change
3621371 there will be some follow on reductions over the next year but the lions share is being done this year

3621374 new york red bulls forward juan pablo angel was voted major league soccers player of the week for week 20 today after his two goal performance helped the red bulls to a 4 1 win over d c united sunday at giants stadium snapping a five game unbeaten streak and putting the red bulls 6 6 7 25 pts in a tie for fourth place in the eastern conference this is the first time in 2008 that a red bull has earned mls player of the week honors

3621429 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3621430 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3621431 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3621432 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3621433 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3621435 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3621436 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3621444 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3621445 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3621446 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3621447 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3621458 we have taken statements from the teacher and students who lodged police reports but referred the matter to the education department for further action
3621459 i dont know whether it is an appreciation to the teacher for the derogatory words

3621482 i believe that dickens was trying to write in a way that allowed the readers to side both with the good and evil it makes us realize that for some people the french revolution was greatly needed and for others it wasnt as imperitive for it to happen

3621500 downward pressure on the philippine economy is mounting owing to slowing exports of electronics products and accelerating inflation
3621501 in 2009 we expect the pace of inflation to decelerate as rice price fuelled inflationary pressure is expected to ease thereafter the economy should recover gradually in 2009 driven by internal demand
3621502 as far as forex is concerned high crude oil prices continue to put the peso at risk of further depreciation if however crude oil prices trend down toward the end of 2008 in response to a slowing world economy then we see a possibility of the peso stabilizing
3621503 we think the downside impact in the peso should be partly offset by robust remittances from ofws overseas filipino workers and increased exports from the bpo business process outsourcing industry

3621508 a wave of admiration almost of worship flow out from him toward obrien
3621509 softly carpeted with cream papered walls and white wainscoting all exquisitely clean
3621510 was alone no telescreen no ear at the keyhole no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his hand
3621511 she knew when to cheer and when to boo and that was all one needed
3621512 in 1951 social psychologist solomon asch devised this experiment to examine the extent to which pressure from other people could affect ones perceptions in total about one third of the subjects who were placed in this situation went along with the clearly erroneous majority
3621513 apparently people conform for two main reasons because they want to be liked by the group and because they believe the group is better informed than they are
3621514 asch found that one of the situational factors that influence conformity is the size of the opposing majority
3621515 online collectivism is suffocating authentic voices in a muddled and anonymous tide of mass mediocrity
3621516 our planet will not be saved by preaching principles and exerting moral suasion after more than three decades spent working in the environmental movement i am convinced that economic self interest whether it is achieved by saving earning or a combination of the two is the most powerful if not the only force capable of bringing about the future we need in time to make a difference to the well being of mother earth
3621517 a non muslim may not become a citizen of the maldives
3621518 this denial of citizenship to non muslims is an extraordinarily harsh measure which places the maldives among the worst countries in the world in regards to the legal foundation for freedom of religion and belief
3621519 the second largest religion in the world after christianity islam is also the fastest growing religion
3621520 already more than a billion people strong islam is the worlds fastest growing religion
3621521 the religion of islam is growing faster than any other religion in the world
3621522 today islam is one of the fastest growing faiths in australia
3621523 dont ever use that word synergy its a hideous word
3621524 you cant force people to work together you cant mandate synergy
3621525 only if it can be demonstrated that doing so is in their own best interests as defined by their own values
3621526 usually boils down to four items money power status and popularity
3621527 its success is based on four principles that you can use to create the most compelling marketing materials possible
3621528 the right message to the right people at the right time
3621529 delivering content when and where it is needed and in the process branding you and your organization as a leader
3621530 innovation should be seen as a tactic not a business strategy
3621531 then theres apple which seems to be an exception to the principle that innovation cannot build a brand certainly apple has been successful because of the widely held belief that all apple products are highly innovative thats true today but what about tomorrow innovation cannot last forever sooner or later apple is going to run up against a brick wall and find itself fighting a host of competitors who dominate their categories apple doesnt dominate any category yet manages to compete successfully against hewlett packard and dell in personal computers against nokia and motorola in cellphones against sony and samsung in consumer electronics against microsoft in personal computer operating systems
3621532 vast changes that include accelerating globalization mounting quantities of information the growing hegemony of science and technology and the clash of civilizations
3621533 you dont need to tell us about the problem we understand that show us the solution

3621535 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3621536 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3621537 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3621538 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3621539 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins
3621540 he is not just winning he is crunching world records
3621541 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3621542 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3621543 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3621544 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3621545 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3621546 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3621547 george bush is in trouble our people did not find any wmd in iraq can you help us
3621548 can we prepare something for that we could bring in some nuclear material from the former soviet union and pretend they are iraqi
3621549 devote some of their airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest and to air contrasting views regarding those matters
3621550 its a business and wed like to have successful businesses in mcallen this didnt work out for the silverados thats fine we wish them the best down the road
3621551 maswoswe has sent a communication to me a proposal to pay it and were negotiating the terms now
3621552 ill probably have that worked out at the end of the week or early next week he says he will pay the debt
3621553 to have this happen im not very happy about it
3621554 its the middle of august and i dont have a coaching job at this point so obviously i dont think it was handled very well for me
3621555 they kept me in limbo for the months of june and july and finally landed where they wanted to be
3621556 niet dat de technologie in de laptops zon grote vooruitgang heeft geboekt elk component afzonderlijk verbruikt nog evenveel stroom maar we hebben wel met onze proprietaire technieken het gebruik van de onderdelen beter afgestemd
3621557 het scherm wordt gedimd en we schakelen ongebruikte hardware uit een ethernetkaart hoeft helemaal geen stroom te krijgen als er geen internetaansluiting via ethernet is
3621558 een aantal cios heeft zich al manifest tegen gekleurde laptops uitgesproken ze zouden te makkelijk herkenbaar zijn en nog een eenvoudiger doelwit van diefstal maar een meerderheid ziet de kleuren wel zitten het is geen geheim dat we met de keuzemogelijkheid marktaandeel van onze concurrenten willen weghalen
3621559 the question is who is the client is the adviser loyal to income from a foreign client or is he loyal to the candidate he is working for now
3621560 its dangerous if youre getting advice from people who are very close to countries on one side or another of a conflict
3621561 receives no compensation of any type from orion strategies and has not since may 15 2008
3621562 the embassy of georgia requested the call because of georgian concerns over recent russian actions dealing with south ossetia and abkhazia
3621563 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
3621564 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3621565 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
3621566 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
3621567 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century
3621568 the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire or reassign them without individual cause
3621569 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3621570 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3621571 it would have ill served the public interest not to appoint him merely because those who first hired him had violated the civil service laws
3621572 focused on plants animals woodwork and above all how many eggs his chickens have laid
3621573 kids today have been given everything they want and dont have to work for it they have no respect for authority
3621574 theyll make remarks right to the face of the mall cops i get to the point where i want to do something
3621575 but the police say we cant that we just have to stand there
3621576 the older people just dont see obama in these glowing terms
3621577 for older voters a lot of the reservations really have to do with this experience factor while younger voters see in obama something much closer to themselves
3621578 kids want to think for themselves they dont care what mom and dad say
3621579 this was a republican stronghold but its changing very quickly because its mom and dad youre republican so i aint ever going to be one of them
3621580 det virker paradoksalt at presse folk til at vende hjem frivilligt til et land som danmark ikke kan sende dem tilbage til if lge international lov
3621581 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3621582 and im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression in which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century
3621583 for mccains team it has become the latest incarnation of what
3621584 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
3621585 the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
3621586 sen mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors
3621587 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
3621588 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3621589 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
3621590 russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3621591 he was not calling for equivalence between russia and georgia he was calling for a ceasefire to stop the violence after russia invaded it was a totally different order of magnitude
3621592 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
3621593 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
3621594 part of the reason we dont have leverage is that we dont have a u s russian relationship it has been adrift
3621595 its easy to say something belligerent about russia im no friend of vladimir putin and cheap shots about tough talk are all well and fine but what are you doing to actually make the situation better
3621596 this type of bluster is fairly counterproductive because it is a bluff theres nothing we can do about this
3621597 it has become a race to be see who can be the tougher i cant see anybody suddenly stepping back and becoming a voice of moderation and calling for calm
3621598 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3621599 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3621600 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3621601 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3621602 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3621603 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3621604 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3621605 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3621606 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3621607 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3621608 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3621609 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3621610 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective
3621611 recalls variously the invasion of afghanistan the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 and even the soviet invasion of georgia in 1922
3621612 this kind of brutal attack has happened before against georgia and against other countries that the russians want to dominate
3621613 russia has the right to intervene anywhere in the former soviet union
3621614 probably the best relations that have been there for quite some time
3621615 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3621616 they of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages
3621617 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way

3621640 after the massive explosion at springfield avenue in west belfast in june 1982 in which local homes were devastated by the brits detonation of ira explosives which were being temporarily stored in the area and which the brits had uncovered the ira stated that the explosives had been unprimed and could have safely been removed from the area without detonating them that is the brits detonated the explosives in an attempt to discredit the ira in nationalist eyes
3621641 firstly i think its important to clarify the background to the explosion you mention

3621647 before digital technology became ubiquitous even mechanical copies of the same material were slightly different there was a degradation when you xeroxed a xeroxed document or recorded a vinyl record onto a cassette
3621648 now that we can create perfect duplicates of photographs music even livestock do we put a greater value on things that are organic and made by hand or do we prefer the perfection of a seamless copy
3621649 we stand in lines forward email repeat overheard slang and opinions and follow trends most of us wake up for work and follow a routine copying the movements we made the day before which are often the same movements made by others were all copiers
3621650 but of course we are all individuals and as such are inherently different from each other even when we do the same things just as an identical outfit will look different when worn by two people the same movement appears different when performed by different dancers even when they are perfectly synchronized

3621685 armstrong manages the difficult proposition of satirizing the very genre in which hes writing
3621686 but not settling for a simple spoof like ian fleming he somehow combines over the top satire with genuinely suspenseful action his ear for funny and believable dialogue goes a long way to making this trick possible
3621687 alban bane my main character is not a spoof of the great spy this is satire and adventure and a thrill ride in honor of the great ian fleming but in no way a silly spoof

3621761 in response nbc sent frantic requests to web sites asking them to take down the illicit clips and restrict authorized video to host countries
3621762 i thought who could reach more people than any other person on the planet
3621763 i knew if she did a show on this it would help a lot of animals
3621764 people will see the connection between pet stores and they will meet the puppies mothers in their rabbit hutches
3621765 it still comes down to consumers buying puppies from pet stores
3621766 i would never ever adopt another pet now without going to a shelter to do it
3621767 yep thats her we had a race in ohio over the weekend and she probably got tired and needed to rest
3621768 thanks for taking good care of her she made it home about 5 oclock and doesnt look worse for the wear
3621769 our hope as that we could get it to the committee and they would find a way to give relief from the rule but they were unable to come up with any way to grant that relief
3621770 just watching him down here three years removed from louisville it brings a smile to my face
3621771 yeager reminds us a little of a right handed pat white
3621772 has a live arm and a whip like release that is smooth and over the top he gets rid of the ball quickly and shows good rpms on all throws is capable of putting some mustard on it when throwing the ball vertical or outside of the numbers and is a very good deep ball thrower both in timing and accuracy shows good ball handling skills and sells fakes well is dangerous on naked bootlegs and misdirection where he can get out on the perimeter and become a dual threat throws very well on the run especially to his right he can buy time shows good initial burst and change of direction skills in the pocket and can create something if protection breaks down isnt an exceptional runner but good enough and will make you defend him as a runner
3621773 final thoughts in this system douglas is likely to have a limited role at first out of all the picks from day two however he seems the likeliest to have long term success we havent had a fast capable slot receiver in what seems like a decade so i welcome harry douglas to the team with open arms
3621774 we need to get something done because hes put on about 15 pounds eating all the food and not working out
3621775 if he doesnt get this thing settled were going to send him over with the defensive line because hes about 230 now
3621776 weclome to the place where your e biz needs are met

3621782 not sure if hes worth 6 years at 80 million
3621783 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3621784 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3621785 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3621786 not sure if hes worth 6 years at 80 million
3621787 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3621788 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3621789 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3621790 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3621791 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3621792 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3621793 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3621794 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3621795 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3621796 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
3621797 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
3621798 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
3621799 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
3621800 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
3621801 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
3621802 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
3621803 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
3621804 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
3621805 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
3621806 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
3621807 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
3621808 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
3621809 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
3621810 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3621811 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3621812 if the primary locks on your doors are entry locksets and theyre working fine theres probably little to gain by replacing them
3621813 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
3621814 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
3621815 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
3621816 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
3621817 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
3621818 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
3621819 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
3621820 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
3621821 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
3621822 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
3621823 its only when you grow up and step back from him or leave him for your own career and your own home its only then that you can measure his greatness and fully appreciate it pride reinforces love
3621824 i think its difficult for him to fix it because of the judgments hes made in the past and his lack of experience
3621825 if we are dissatisfied with obama as a potential president hillary cannot be expected to change our minds
3621826 theres an unbelievable camaraderie and yet in some cases we have nothing in common
3621827 there is an element of venting but also if you thought you were alone you were wrong
3621828 if this party turns its back on bill clinton its not a party that deserves our loyalty
3621829 my aunties got a colostomy bag and shoes to match
3621830 its so humid in new york today that june allyson is wearing double depends
3621831 what does it take to get the democratic nomination for lieutenant governor
3621832 something less it appears than the qualifications for buying an apartment in the dakota
3621833 for personal reasons its for our own personal reasons o k
3621834 the 35 million is where the market is today so thats all i can say
3621835 one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion
3621836 we are in negotiations for space at 605 third avenue and for other spaces as well
3621837 we are at 410 park and 400 park and then we are also in the heron tower on 55th street between park and madison and were connected in all the spaces
3621838 it creates certain inefficiencies in having three elevator banks three buildings three sets of everything but were talking to everyone including our current landlords
3621839 after labor day a lot of people whove been on the offensive they have gotten some feedback and will start to realize that hey this economy isnt as strong as we thought
3621840 i think theyre going to come back and look at things differently
3621841 as we move into the fall and into early next year you will see a further softening of the market
3621842 i think people come back after labor day and soberly assess where they stand
3621843 in this case the council member has indicated hes worked out a number of issues that are involved and he supports the project
3621844 its a beautiful old place but i mean seriously who goes to nevis
3621845 theyve got all their friends moving there theyre trying to turn nevis into the next st barths or whatever
3621846 i think they want to build up the value and then sell it
3621847 very peaceful and not overrun and the locals are not surly
3621848 frankly the design and space was so important to him and less so to me so he really ruled the roost on that one
3621849 david was a fierce man and an elegant man i thought the apartment really reflected that
3621850 it was not simply a place to come home and be comfortable
3621851 i came a very funny man im not alone in thinking that and he was showing a party he had had that somebody videoed
3621852 he could control the entire house the shades the lights the a v system
3621853 i cant tell you that was his pleasure i was so glad he was able to live that out
3621854 it was just too much to do its not the way i want to spend my life looking for light bulbs and getting programs restructured
3621855 our thanks to taylor momsen and ali lohan for making 14 the new 35
3621856 its funny because i forget that i look the same you know that i look the same all the time
3621857 i have two different modes i have my on set mode and then i have my mode with my friends and family my taylor mode and when im in my taylor mode i forget that people still see me as jenny it takes a minute
3621858 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever after another then again count me out because that will be the biggest of all time
3621859 this is a parting gift from the bush administration to its timber friends
3621860 it flies in the face of the science that says we need to protect more habitat not less
3621861 after almost 20 years of relying on a static regulatory approach which has led to continual inaction and further decline of the owl it is clear we should be using to improve the health of our forests and the spotted owl
3621862 unfortunately this designation doubles down on a patently absurd approach
3621863 im just excited to be in nature and do art
3621864 throw me a million dollars and say do what you want
3621865 it was lonely growing up and boring you in the country in the sticks
3621866 i had a lot of time to get into other things that i wouldnt really have a chance to explore if i was focusing on girls so that was good
3621867 all that time i would have been flirting with girls i used on photography so i cant complain
3621868 i came here thinking it was going to be 1969 or like the factory
3621869 i heard all these stories from my dad and his friends
3621870 now i feel like everybody goes to the same place you see the same people
3621871 i remember when bungalow was hot man you could be sitting next to some good looking skater kid quentin tarantino on one side on the other side youve got some crazy lady and a homeless guy
3621872 you know how girls are once they see something like that they can never get over it
3621873 good girls dont good girls dont shell be telling you good girls i do
3621874 americans dont like to be reminded that their food ever swam or walked or flew
3621875 if a person doesnt play very well or is not particularly coordinated i wouldnt put that person at shortstop or second base
3621876 at one oclock we have batting practice and you see right away if someone can play the game or not
3621877 if a celebrity cannot play the game we have them announce
3621878 certainly mort zuckerman hes going to pitch again hes been pitching for 15 years the writers are always crying about something or another
3621879 you have these artists who are good looking fun and creative while the writers tend to be a curmudgeonly group who gets really upset its fun to watch them self destruct and l ose im a landscape architect so i can go either way but i always choose the artists
3621880 its a great day to celebrate diversity last year i was coming and you know im supposed to be the
3621881 i dont want to bore you but i was actually crying a lot today real tears
3621882 i let myself actually make a noise crying it was like a movie you know
3621883 cheap and cheerful its a shoddy summary of success literature it also walks you through your first job so its a i tend to ramble and then i make it hard for people
3621884 i think im going to refuse to answer the whats the best piece of advice question
3621885 a window is probably a nicer thing to have in your bedroom than a closet
3621886 a marketing concept it is a way for property owners to say bedroom without actually having a bedroom
3621887 a mercedes benz driving ignoramus that stops at the scene of an accident to ask police for directions
3621888 his best friend julie comes over and together they figure out who committed this dastardly deed
3621889 and if that is the worst poo on the couch would be the next closest
3621890 weve got a russian balancing act weve got a comedy act there are aerial acts its kind of like a cirque du soleil but at the pier in a small tent
3621891 its very intimate no one is very far away from the performers have you been to the spiegel tent before its a very special tent
3621892 there is nudity yes of course we cant shy away from that
3621893 because what im trying to bring to the stage is intimacy when you watch this you have to be
3621894 i was kind of surprised to hear the name highbrow bbq also
3621895 considering its 25 and its geared more toward younger hipsters and so forth i think what theyre trying to do is have some bbq fare but not your typical bbq fare like im going to do a moroccan spiced pork taco
3621896 face i guess different many of them face different financial disadvantages or come from i want to say this the right way
3621897 onstage and off its all talk and you like it
3621898 and i love the stage because we have this reverence for language and any enterprise which depends so much on what people say and how they say it must be at the heart of what it means to be civilized so i want to devote my life to it
3621899 obtain a freedom of movement and of life for ourselves
3621900 a realistic absurdist piece about a professor who does not have a cello giving a lecture that turns out to be about
3621901 its more like its one of those things that when you see it you know what its about
3621902 it sounds pretentious but its true new york is wonderful people just say everything its so wonderful to be a writer here
3621903 how difficult it is to be palestinian and how difficult it is for a palestinian to be a writer or a poet how can he achieve literary freedom in such slavish conditions and how can he preserve the literariness of literature in such brutal times
3621904 a land on the brink of dawn let us not quarrel about the number of those whove died here they lie together furnishing the grass for us that we should be reconciled
3621905 rockys still got a boot on for a ligament strain tear and hell start running again shortly but the likelihood is he wont be available to us till the second game in africa
3621906 and adam has had an operation on a broken bone in his hand and hes in a similar predicament he wont be available till the second game it appears
3621907 jimmy horwills had some bruising he potentially may not be available till the second game but i understand i havent caught up with him yet i understand hes very positive so well have to wait and see
3621908 lote has had a specialist visit around his knee and he may require an operation at some point well just have to see how positive he is about his circumstance because essentially it hasnt changed a lot i understand
3621909 hes had a knee niggle a knee complaint for a while now if hes positive then he may well carry on and look at getting a clean up done later if its impacting on his ability to train and play then we may have to seek an operation earlier
3621910 theyre part of the territory youve just got to roll with them well have twenty two fit blokes come kick off time and theyll be well prepared and keen
3621911 i can barely get up for a snack during the commercial let alone train every day for 15 years straight
3621912 i figured you would appreciate it after how hammered you got last night
3621913 i didnt know if i should call a hospital or not you were pretty bad off
3621914 sorry to be blunt but you dont you may want to take a bath
3621915 youre gonna need to wash out your mouth and eat something before you sleep
3621916 otherwise you wont be feeling so hot when you wake up trust me on this
3621917 i was wondering if you remembered i told you my name when you started talking to me at the bar but i guess you forgot that
3621918 cant risk anything bigger your stomach might protest in a big way
3621919 ill get you something bigger later once youve had a little more rest
3621920 it yearns to be near you always and forever and nothing more
3621921 if it is by that logic then i would have to say the same
3621922 it was ricky januarie who helped make history in the house of pain
3621923 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrum half
3621924 is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting line up
3621925 conrad jantjes is on present form the number one full back
3621926 it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone montgomery his 100th test cap
3621927 i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3621928 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of
3621929 it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
3621930 is the team that has been selected of such a nature that it will ensure the support of most south africans
3621931 we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011
3621932 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone peter should be reminded of his mandate
3621933 its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year

3621939 this is going to be in the bible isnt it
3621940 but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you let him be eternally condemned
3621941 one of the major components that separates a seasoned writer from an amateur is the emphasis on setting the category of seasoned writers is by no means this girls dwelling place but freshman year fiction writing left me with a better understanding of setting in writing heck this blog nearly tripled in its readership once it took on the personal of a midwestern transplant living in los angeles or maybe it was the advertising to friends on facebook that did that
3621942 theyre trying hard to win theres only so much you can do theyre not supermen
3621943 no team ive ever seen in baseball has been decimated like this it would kill any team imagine the red sox without jon lester pitching is 70 percent of the game wang won 19 games two straight years chamberlain became the most dominating pitcher in baseball you cant lose two guys like that
3621944 if we need to add a top veteran pitcher well do that well do whatever we need to do next year well be extremely dangerous

3621975 im a great believer in making your own destiny whether you win or dont win so thats why i took it on there are times you have to take responsibility in the final round youre not going to win any other way
3621976 and lets be brutally honest i do believe i can do it
3621977 i love the idea of major champonships i cant wait for the next one seven months away in fact im glad im not an olympic athlete because id have to wait four years for the next games
3621978 i love the intensity of the week i much prefer majors to regular tournaments which feel like a sprint the majors a marathon you just hang in there and be patient which suits my game right down to the ground
3621979 if it happens to be the masters and the us open well thatd be great all four majors are unbelievable but youve just got to focus on each one as it comes and if its meant to happen itll happen
3621980 yet oakland hills was the exceptionally exciting and i enjoyed being so comfortable on sunday ive won plenty of tournaments like that over the years thats my experience
3621981 i do see things better on the golf course and i do read other people very well
3621982 ive a good idea of who to watch in a tournament and who to fear what guys are going to do and what can happen i read tournaments very well
3621983 garcia started off in a blaze of glory took on some high risk shots and played them great early on he obviously got very lucky on six to make birdie and things were going his way
3621984 he got up and down on nine but i knew somewhere along the way things were going to give and that would be my opportunity and thankfully i was in a position to take it
3621985 its a challenge for all women whatever profession youre in to work and have a kid
3621986 and whats interesting for me is that when i finally did have my son that everything picked up with my career from the moment that he was born
3621987 im just going to think like im playing with my local club really once youre on the field and youve had a look thats about it
3621988 it was a bit of a shock hopefully i can back it up
3621989 its amazing im shocked about that to be honest even though he has been there for me for everything taken me overseas thats just awesome
3621990 theres some nerves in there but im excited i cant wait for it
3621991 ive learned so much already in just a short time being here hes kosmina changed my game heaps
3621992 if it sounds to good to be true it probably is
3621993 nah man i dont feel like fighting anyone man im tired
3621994 oh no i never knew youre right you choose not to
3621995 he was my steady from the very beginning which my mother was against because she thought i should be meeting other men
3621996 but i said no mother this is the young man i want to date
3621997 he looked over at me and im waving my scarf and he salutes me
3621998 and donna jewel turned and said were never going to see them again and i said yes we are well guess what
3621999 the doorbell rings and i open the door and theres the base commander
3622000 i had hopes that somewhere theyd find him but they didnt and then they found the remains
3622001 and they said real quietly they paused for a few moments and they said could we have about 12 of the envelopes mrs scharf well return them to you and i said sure and thats how it happened
3622002 as we were landing the flight attendant said to the passengers ladies and gentlemen last night we picked up a very special passenger from hawaii
3622003 i said to them i want to thank you for your wonderful love at this moment for my husband and me thank you all ever so much i was getting very emotional i still do when i say that
3622004 i can go anytime i want to talk to him and i love sitting out there and i know where hes at
3622005 hes not in the mud not lost forever in the jungle
3622006 too many cars and too little parking space mean people have to park their vehicles far from office or home and often on the road itself this gives thieves more time to break into cars and drive away with them joint commissioner of police crime rakesh maria said on thursday
3622007 we now have key makers who specialise in different models there is jugnu who specialises in breaking into innovas and there is istehar who handles only scorpios they give the industry an extra edge an official from the western suburbs said
3622008 we have arrested members of 21 gangs specialising in car thefts in the last 10 months joint commissioner of police crime maria said
3622009 this racket is very organised we have unearthed several cases in which cars were stolen after orders were placed from bihar an official said most cars stolen from mumbai end up in northern states like bihar and uttar pradesh and the seven northeastern states and even nepal
3622010 all these states and nepal have one thing in common the roads there are very bad so many of the orders that thieves here get are for the tough multi utility vehicles that can take bad road conditions in their stride he added
3622011 the mumbai agent can almost never lead us to the agent from another state and that is where the lead goes cold this is the most important reason for the low rate of recovery an official said
3622012 does anyone else here see naked man walking down the street
3622013 maybe the problem is he wants a wolf more than a wife

3622016 it means that there is no opportunity for the ccc or other interested parties to consider this version before submissions close
3622017 the ccc submits that this is a cynical exercise in regulatory gaming by telstra that is so blatant that it demands that the government finally step in
3622018 the ccc has in the past argued that there were two courses of action open to the government to immediately close this gaming opportunity the first would be to allow the commission to amend an undertaking into a form that it found acceptable the second would be to remove the undertakings provision from telecommunications altogether
3622019 the ccc submits that interested parties can have no confidence that the telstra is engaged in anything other than a sham designed to distract resources and attention of the industry and the regulator
3622020 the ccc has long argued that telstras motivation in presenting serial undertakings to the commission has been directed at gaming regulatory processes rather than seeking to legitimately provide prices terms and conditions that can resolve disputation in the industry

3622028 but notice that when that happens youre channeling pronoiafunk anyway and therefore are picking up the pronoiac news network loud and clear
3622029 its when my horoscopes come as a slap on the ass that youre not paying attention
3622030 i think the afl is probably on the right path there it is dangerous now to just let people come on the ground so i think theyll just look after the players welfare
3622031 whats the risk you just dont know when there are a lot of people and youve just got to be careful dont you
3622032 you wouldnt want any spectators to get injured let alone any of the players when people are in a mad rush
3622033 they might even have security now at the myer stocktake sale to make sure that no one gets an injury going up the stairs its something very similar
3622034 if its meant to be itll happen if its meant to be for brendan and he kicks a hundred well then thats fantastic
3622035 but if not we just worry about winning the four points as a group
3622036 if we can keep winning we might give ourselves another week to give him a chance but at the moment its just about what the team can do not what he can do
3622037 we wont be going out of our way running into open goals and kicking the ball at right angles to fevola when the goal should be kicked
3622038 we think our confidence is growing and were playing fairly good football over the last month without winning all the games
3622039 this gives us a reflection on exactly where were at get the best of foxtel
3622040 if hansen is out then weve got as in tall forwards to replace him probably only tony notte available
3622041 hes like all teenagers over the next two or three years hell physically develop to get closer to achieving his full potential but hes probably good enough now
3622042 hes quick and hes got clean hands they are two good strengths to have
3622043 thommo dropped his form for a couple of weeks about a month ago but hes really fought back well and ive been pleased with the way hes done that
3622044 and in a struggling team claremont the last couple of weeks hes played very well so we certainly take that into account and believe he can come in now
3622045 look hes still working through getting his quad strength back from a knee operation thats what can happen you lose a bit of power so well weigh that up
3622046 des is a guy thats got the magic that you look for sometimes and hes got the ability even at 90 per cent to hold his own in the team
3622047 hes trained his backside off to get back and play because he loves playing so you dont deny a guy that he wants to play as many games as he can

3622072 for decades hes been washingtons biggest celebrity john mccain and as washington embraced him john mccain hugged right back the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games
3622073 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3622074 if the celebrity issue were not hurting them they would have ignored it
3622075 for many americans mr mccains rhetoric sounded almost like a trip back in time to the days of the cold war when major foreign policy addresses by american presidential aspirants always included the requisite bashing of the soviet union

3622110 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3622119 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3622120 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3622121 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3622122 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3622123 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3622124 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3622125 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3622126 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3622127 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3622128 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3622153 you proceed with hate crime charges in connection with the anti israel rally held at mcmaster university on feb 29 2008 as reported by various news outlets including the hamilton mountain news hate filled slogans such as death to jews and viva jihad traumatized those in attendance

3622155 bnai brith canadas 2007 audit of antisemitic incidents illustrates the growing trend of antisemitic incidents across canada taking place at educational settings
3622156 while free speech is undoubtedly a fundamental component of canadian society it should not act as a shield for protesters chanting death to jews and viva jihad as universities across canada gear up for a new academic year we look to your leadership to signal that poisonous messaging that promotes hatred and violence against a particular segment of the community in this case jewish students will not be tolerated on or off campus
3622157 we are well aware of your ongoing commitment to combating hatred against all of ontarios diverse communities and welcome your ongoing efforts on this front please do not hesitate to call upon bnai brith which stands ready to lend its expertise and assist in any way possible
3622158 we are calling on the attorney general to act on the request of the hamilton police failure to bring this matter to a resolution is at odds with the severity of the offence
3622159 campus is an important microcosm of society where there can be no immunity from hate as universities across canada gear up for a new academic year any further delay leaves jewish students at risk

3622161 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3622162 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3622163 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3622164 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

3622167 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
3622168 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
3622169 is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
3622170 what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted and that is why reading a book and viewing a movie can both make us feel as if we literally feel what the protagonist is going through

3622179 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3622180 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3622181 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3622182 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3622183 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3622184 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3622185 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3622186 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3622187 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3622188 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3622189 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3622190 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3622191 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3622192 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3622193 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3622194 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3622195 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3622196 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3622197 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3622198 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3622199 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3622200 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3622201 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3622202 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3622203 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3622204 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3622235 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3622236 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3622237 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3622238 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3622239 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3622240 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3622241 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3622242 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3622243 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3622244 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3622245 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3622246 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3622247 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3622248 we think byrd can add that veteran presence and some stability to our rotation
3622249 hes been on a roll since the all star break hes been pretty darn good every time out there this is a guy whos been through this before and someone we think can be dependable and we know what were going to get every fifth day
3622250 it seemed like the right time to add this guy you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august or september because theres very little you can do about it so this was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran we feel we can trust
3622251 i changed my glove and its rock hard so if i cover first ill be in trouble but i cant wiggle it and give away what i think what was happening a little bit
3622252 i changed my motion so i wasnt going over my head with my hands anymore
3622253 im throwing a little better breaking ball now and ive gotten left handers out a lot better over the last five games
3622254 ive had an up and down season its been a roller coaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident i like the way im throwing the ball i have no fear no wonder about which pitcher is going to show up i feel really good about where i am right now and i think that probably had something to do with why the red sox picked me up
3622255 im really excited to be with a great team thats in a pennant race here
3622256 im a big fan of tito and i think the red sox have a great thing going its really hard to be disappointed about anything that boston offers and ill be there tomorrow and get ready to go under way
3622257 its nice he wont be overwhelmed by anything we can throw at him in this environment in october if were lucky enough to get there we know who paul byrd is hes going to consistently locate and throw strikes and change speeds and show great feel on the mound we think we might be getting him at the right time
3622258 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3622259 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3622260 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3622261 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3622262 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3622263 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3622264 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3622265 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3622266 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3622267 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3622268 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3622269 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3622270 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3622271 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3622272 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3622273 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3622274 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3622275 were delighted to receive such a practical piece of equipment from the cancer council and are proud to be one of only 61 councils across the state to be awarded one
3622276 the sunsmart marquee will meet a strong need in the community for shade shelters and in the long run could help to prevent skin cancer providing both sun and rain protection the marquee will be available all year round for local sport and community groups to borrow for free from the council
3622277 were pretty lucky in scone that the building industry hasnt eased off too much
3622278 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3622279 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3622280 i wont be able to afford to live in my house
3622281 there has to be a limit somewhere there has to be a stopping point
3622282 a sober assessment of present day economic and budgetary realities
3622283 we wanted to be conservative so were not factoring that in
3622284 theres actually enough money in hand to do this project
3622285 and im not sure theyve done that very well over the last couple years
3622286 he will certainly be looking for a strong demonstration from the leonardo of fiscal independence and sustainability in the long term
3622287 thank you god for restoring my faith in politics and politicians
3622288 i listened to my constituents ive been getting five to ten calls every day plus e mail
3622289 theres nothing worse than trying to make that kind of a decision for 100 000 people
3622290 these two boys are inseparable bridger and tyler have been best friends for years they live around the corner from each other
3622291 my clients are ticked off all of the documents weve seen until recently had to do with a cup
3622292 thats not possible years ago the power plant applied for a pud and theres nothing for a cup
3622293 the group simply made a mistake when they drafted the initiative we cant go back and change the documents
3622294 theres various types of permits you can get to develop land under sevier county ordinances a cup is appropriate in this case but they suddenly switched it to a pud permit which is really unusual
3622295 development of compatible land uses arranged in such a way as to provide desirable living environments that may include private and common open spaces for recreation circulation and or aesthetic uses conservation or development standards creation of areas for multiple use that are of benefit to the neighborhood
3622296 the label was either switched at the last minute or it was a pud permit from the beginning and someone messed up by calling it a cup
3622297 i dont know what ultimately the team will decide to do as far as possible charges filed
3622298 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it
3622299 and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3622300 which were carried out over a lengthy period of time and were not based on formal advice from anyone systematically violated federal law and department policy and constituted misconduct
3622301 the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3622302 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see to put it in concrete terms i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
3622303 we have done about all we can with alternatives to incarceration
3622304 but it is a major step toward not releasing people who judges have told us must stay in jail
3622305 we must move forward with our master plan if we are to come up with better answers but in the short term we will do what we have to do
3622306 unless the sheriff is willing to write that check for us
3622307 that is going to be a gut wrenching decision for everyone on the council
3622308 to suggest that this is some sort of election year ruse i dont think any citizen in the county would tolerate that
3622309 bold action to address what may be the defining issue of our era
3622310 each of us can do so much to help our carbon footprint
3622311 every day we can see unhealthy air its unacceptable every generation has had a challenge and this is our challenge today
3622312 were past the point of trying to debate climate change
3622313 were meeting everyone in the middle providing some relief to the taxpayer and providing the services that everyone really really really wants
3622314 fans expect these types of movies to be more true to the source material
3622315 theres no reason there couldnt be a conan movie every two years hes almost like batman hes a dark hero hes a hard hero he has to be badass but we also have to like him
3622316 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3622317 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3622318 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3622319 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3622320 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3622321 the results suggest that efforts should be made to develop drugs that could be given in a controlled clinical or treatment environment in which addicts would have their most potent drug memories reactivated such treatments would be expected to diminish the effects of those memories in the future and help individuals resist relapse and maintain their abstinence
3622322 this is a new approach to the treatment of drug addiction that has great potential additionally this might also be used to treat other neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by maladaptive memories including post traumatic stress and phobic anxiety disorders
3622323 i wish i had asked for my day in court rather than accept a police caution that way i could have explained that i was trying to do what was right for my daughter
3622324 jess isnt bad but some of the 13 year olds who live here do use drugs and drink and i dont want that path for her
3622325 she didnt appreciate the seriousness of it and if i had simply grounded her it wouldnt have proved the point
3622326 i was in control of my actions and had no intention of causing her physical pain i felt that she needed something to shock her
3622327 i did deserve the slapping because of the things id been doing i was expecting my dad to come home from the police station and for everything to be the same as before
3622328 we have lost an experienced youth worker and men like him are worth their weight in gold there is clearly a need for better legislation
3622329 on monday june 30 a 13 year old girl was slapped in the face at a house in wythenshawe
3622330 placebos can affect patients response to pain therapy and also influence the results of clinical trials we have shown that responses to experimental placebos alter how the brain responds to pain and also that responses to experimental placebos persist in repeated testing in healthy volunteers
3622331 this allows us to measure how the brains pain control system is activated under different conditions we hope this study will help us understand how the brain deals with pain it is also likely to lead to development of new painkilling therapies and better ways of testing them
3622332 of the 50 people attending the church only six are in full time employment so the effort by local people to raise 150 000 of the money has been tremendous
3622333 the vision was for the new building to be a place for the whole community to use
3622334 we are delighted virgin has made this generous gesture and are anxious to get the job done quickly
3622335 i am appealing to this man to come forward as he could hold information vital to the inquiry
3622336 it was horrible the first time to go through mrsa but when he got meningitis it was even worse
3622337 within minutes there were nurses and doctors all trying to save him they were amazing
3622338 hes our little miracle hes a fighter and he has come through so much we really want to thank the staff who helped him
3622339 ally works with the humblest of materials to create pieces on a monumental scale
3622340 i think manchesters success has been down to the attitude
3622341 since the 1960s with the hollies every generation has influenced the next and produced band after band writing hit after hit
3622342 tony wilson helped bring credibility to it and people began to be proud to be from manchester
3622343 its happening again with some brilliant young bands playing all types of music
3622344 i predict there will be even more big names coming out of the city soon
3622345 i was a year short on my pension payments and they offered to make this up
3622346 but only if i was to renounce all grievances against them and not to complain about them any more i obviously turned them down
3622347 this was to prevent me creating trouble or publicising what i felt was wrong with the university
3622348 the appeal hearing was incredibly brief as if they had made up their minds already
3622349 there has been a general disinvestment in humanities which has affected not just me but others as well i think it is very short sighted of manchester it is because of financial mismanagement that they are having to freeze posts
3622350 this offer is still available and made without prejudice and should you accept will represent a full and final settlement of any outstanding issues or grievances you may have with the university
3622351 july 31 marked prof terry eagletons normal contractual retirement date at 65 and he is no longer employed at the university
3622352 there has been no decline in actual opening hours but the definition of the target has narrowed and become more restrictive
3622353 in the light of this we will have to revise our approach but the bottom line is we have already significantly improved access to primary care and will improve it even further in the future
3622354 we have pilot schemes under way such as doctors in store at sainsburys and an at home extended hours service through the bury and rochdale doctors on call co operative these pilots no longer meet the government targets for extended hours as patients are not seen at a gp practice
3622355 it was very tough i was pleased to break the record but it meant more to raise money
3622356 winning was the icing on the cake and breaking the record the sprinkles on top
3622357 theyre great matt is one of the nicest guys youll ever me
3622358 you have no idea what weve been through they are jerking me around period
3622359 of course the youth do receive counseling and have other professionals help managing them but these professionals are not always on site and available for every crisis when it occurs
3622360 it is irresponsible to try to ask our taxpayers to do any more
3622361 of all the things out there the zoo is not the highest priority
3622362 but in my mind it is a high priority that voters should decide
3622363 an incremental step to making health care more efficient and more effective
3622364 youre tracking all kinds of symptoms and issues before they evolve into something that is very chronic and hard to manage
3622365 it seems to be growing and expanding quite a bit
3622366 its helping our members be in charge of their health care and help them make wise choices
3622367 we know for a fact she was not his lover she had dated him but did not have any type of intimate relationship which the word lover infers
3622368 the more we can mobilize this community the fewer patents that will actually be granted
3622369 whatever happens in the patent reform world in the next u s administration is great but we have to act now to stop the granting of patents that threaten linux and open source in general
3622370 a production environment where we educate and train people to do this well work with them to make sure its put in a form that is acceptable
3622371 those are kind of the key areas to linux as it moves forward
3622372 this land absorbs the skins of martyrs this land promises wheat and stars worship it we are its salt and its water we are its wound but a wound that fights
3622373 i long for my mothers bread my mothers coffee her touch childhood memories grow up in me day after day i must be worth my life at the hour of my death worth the tears of my mother
3622374 i called the police but they took two hours to get there
3622375 they need to do something so these men can be caught
3622376 i am still very shocked and shaken about what happened it was very frightening they punched me in the face and stole the keys
3622377 i am just glad there were witnesses there or they could have killed me
3622378 its going to cost me 1 500 to repair the damage
3622379 in the wwf a clear indicator of just how old this interview is since the wwf is now referred to as the wwe
3622380 to upset china on their own turf from a 47th to an 18th perspective i cant even put it into words its remarkable
3622381 upsetting the u s on any day in archery for canada is a big deal

3622383 hemos aprobado en general los seis principios de alto el fuego y de arreglo del conflicto
3622384 necesitamos detalles legales resoluciones del consejo de seguridad de la onu y una mayor presencia de observadores internacionales sobre el terreno
3622385 iniciar a partir de ma ana el cumplimiento de los principios acordados
3622386 garantizar la soberan a integridad territorial y seguridad de georgia
3622387 completamente normal que rusia quiera defender los intereses de sus compatriotas en su pa s y los de los ruso parlantes fuera de sus fronteras
3622388 los pacificadores rusos cumplir n y seguir n cumpliendo sus funciones en el c ucaso
3622389 son un factor clave de la seguridad en el c ucaso
3622390 es extra a la situaci n cuando un personaje que perpetr miles de asesinatos es considerado terrorista y otro que hizo lo mismo es considerado presidente de un estado soberano elegido leg timamente el derecho internacional no puede tener un doble rasero
3622391 currently ministry of health ministry of social development funded dss clients get inferior levels of funding and face hurdles in acquiring such things as modified equipment housing and personal care and home help support compared to acc funded clients who have comparatively better access to these supports
3622392 i have had to endure long waits for such things as assessments for equipment modifications and also when i was working recently i was not eligible for free home help as my income was assessed as being too high
3622393 this is the only just way to address the issue while we acknowledge that there are issues that long term acc clients face as well which need addressing the alliance will make this a priority if it becomes part of government again as labour has failed to do anything significant for the last nine years despite this being a part of the 2001 new zealand disability strategy document
3622394 its systems go for charter change and we are supporting joint congressional resolution 10 which is pending in the senate
3622395 we are putting our support to the senate which already mustered a substantial number of senators who affixed their signatures to the resolution
3622396 we expect that a similar move in the house of representatives will snowball to concur with the senates overwhelming support to the move this is our way forward in the effort to set up a federal system in mindanao to respond to the aspiration of our muslim communities in the south
3622397 she strongly believes there must be reform in the constitution
3622398 so its not correct to say that the cat is out of bag right now when she has been saying this when she campaigned for president she supported it
3622399 i would like to say that resolution 10 speaks only of a federal system it does not deal with the adoption of a parliamentary system under which gloria can conceivably extend her term by running for prime minister
3622400 there may be truth to the insinuation that the peace agreement that the administration has worked out with the moro islamic liberation front may be used by malaca ang as a pretense to amend the constitution to enable mrs arroyo to circumvent the constitutional ban against her reelection
3622401 not to commit the mistake of riding on the federalism proposal to perpetuate mrs arroyo in power because this is bound to be repudiated by the people
3622402 we have to go before the clouds close in again
3622403 social bookmarking site that focuses on sharing the best personal finance and money articles made by a personal finance blogger pinyo from
3622404 the show is a different maid in a different manhattan
3622405 while the hotels clientele is an obvious part of this world im more interested in the downstairs part of upstairs downstairs
3622406 she will be very integral in the pilot and series
3622407 ben what a massive contribution to the copywriting world thanks
3622408 immediately pulled out between 6 to 10 things to test in my sales letters online
3622409 i usually have a stack of a dozen books or so on my shelf and everything goes on the bottom of the shelf after skimming it there were so many tips that i immediately picked up it went to the top of the book shelf and and it was the next book that i read my first read through i pulled out between six to ten new things to take and test in my own sales letters online and its on the shelf for another read through again coming up soon
3622410 awesome inspiring your book is going right on the shelf next to one of my other often consulted copywriting books by none other than clayton himself nice work
3622411 the secrets in this book have put a lot of money in my pocket and they can do the same for you if you apply them to your own ads

3622496 this is a sensitive situation the residents are ardent beitar fans while the new owner comes from the village of the terrorists who carried out the three recent attacks in jerusalem

3622563 if israel will not support our choice of an independent palestinian state in the occupied territories including east jerusalem then the alternative demand of the palestinian people and leadership will be a bi national state
3622564 israel has in effect presented us only with a third option after its bantustan isation of the occupied territories
3622565 that is to accept a state of leftovers but this is simply not acceptable if israel does not agree to a two state solution based on the 1967 borders we have to ask for a one state solution
3622566 its a threat because it basically waves the demographic issue in israels face
3622567 its a mistaken threat its overused the last time it led to the unilateral israeli disengagement process and most israelis are still in favour of unilateral disengagement if this threat turns into more than a threat the israeli response would be more unilateralism
3622568 its very hard for outsiders to gauge weve seen statements that say theyre making good progress and statements to the opposite effect all of these are tactics designed by both sides to create pressure but i think the general issue that has to be faced is that both leaderships are extremely weak
3622569 the statement means one of two things either qurei wants something more in negotiations or he wants a completely new israeli position regardless the positions are very far apart on all issues on borders on jerusalem on refugees i dont think the israelis are going to give in on these issues to meet minimum palestinian demands

3622576 i think they are waiting to see what some other receivers do before they offer me
3622577 im going to visit both of them over labor day weekend id like to make my decision in early september so itll be after i visit those
3622578 i think they are waiting to see what some other receivers do before they offer me
3622579 i went there as a wide receiver and ran a 4 38 forty yard dash but they said they want me as a cornerback i really want to play wide receiver or quarterback in college and think i did good enough to get offered
3622580 lsu is only like 30 minutes away and i always go to a bunch of their games
3622581 i think this year will be a rebuilding year for them though i dont think theyll win the national championship especially without quarterback ryan perrilloux
3622582 im going to visit both of them over labor day weekend
3622583 id like to make my decision in early september so itll be after i visit those two schools
3622584 they sent me a lot of mail and they always email me
3622585 they also said that id be able to play both football and basketball there
3622586 if i go to an sec school ill only focus on football
3622587 but if i go to an acc school ill try and do both
3622588 i really like that they are going to be running the triple option
3622589 we run that at my high school too and they are saying i could play receiver or quarterback
3622590 i guess its in atlanta and theres a lot to do there
3622591 i dont really know much about the area of arkansas

3622620 its out of museums now but the industry needs to do a better job of getting information into peoples hands when theyre looking for it

3622626 the impression that green building has to be modern weird solar ugly

3622647 pearce should take his own advice on when it comes to his dependence on taxpayer money to run his own campaign
3622648 pearces hypocritical taking of a taxpayer handout to finance his campaign is another sign of a politician milking the system its an embarrassment to fiscal conservatives
3622649 its a big pet peeve to district 18 voters they feel its akin to receiving electoral food stamps theyre bagging groceries at the checkout line while pearce walks away with filet mignon

3622652 my ambition is to play for my country and i think with aston villa i will have that possibility every player wants to play international football and that is my aim
3622653 this is the best league in the world and last year villa did very well they play very good football and had a fantastic season
3622654 so i am very happy to come here with the opportunity to play in the premier league we are also playing in europe this season so that will be good
3622655 i watched villa last season and martin oneill is a very good coach he plays exciting attacking football and i am excited to be here

3622666 the company has posted excellent results for the first quarter of fy09 by registering phenomenal growth across all the parameters the net sales have grown massively by 118 over the last 4 quarters to rs 450 63 million in q1fy09 against rs 206 58 million clocked in q1fy08 at the same time the expenditures grew slower at 69 leading to sharp increase in the operating profit
3622667 presently the stock is trading at rs 417 which is at 9 53 times to its earnings and 4 50 times to its book value of rs 92 80 since the stock seems to offers extremely good investment opportunities we initiate a buy signal on the stock with a target price of rs 651 in medium to long term investment horizon expecting an appreciation of about 56 from the current level of rs 417
3622668 castrol is a market leader in lubricants in india its actually an fmcg company if you will permit me to say this and spewing out cash distributes close to about 70 80 of its net profit every years as dividend interestingly over the last two years the company has been posting improving margins and that tells me about its pricing power even in the face of rising base oil prices if you look at the june quarter which was the second quarter for them they have done very well they have maintained a very decent 15 topline growth and this is been accompanied by margin expansions of more than a 180 basis points
3622669 it is getting into a stage where it can command its pricing it can generate more cash i dont know what they are going to do with this cash because they still continue to distribute a lot of this as dividend the interim dividend is up from 4 5 to 6 this year i would expect at least rs 17 18 of dividend so that is about 6 dividend yield in this choppy market a high quality company brand value earning better margins and growing reasonably well if not very fast offers a very high margin of safety the target price of rs 400 450 is very comfortable here
3622670 some of the injuries that we might see as a result of a lack of practice time could be more related to conditioning than fatigue
3622671 somebody toward the end of a game or toward the end of a practice might sustain an injury because maybe theyre less focused and therefore they are more susceptible to being caught off guard by another player particularily in a collision sport like football
3622672 traditional two a day practices where youd practice in the morning and in the evening are advantageous because the athlete often has time to cool down in between re hydrate in between and help to maintain focus because its not a monotonous four or five hour practice thats going continuously
3622673 the fact that teams will probably going 4 5 hours in the afternoon probably raises a concern a little bit about some muscle injuries such as the groin hamstrings quadriceps because those muscles are being taxed in a way that they have not been taxed up to this point
3622674 perhaps the first practice is maybe a more of a technical practice with the second practice having more conditioning to it rather than having two conditioning practices
3622675 thats where i would start to see more concern and more risk for injuries

3622743 the data is likely to show a further rise in unemployment the figures will confirm that we are entering a crucial stage when the decisions taken by the bank of england and the government will have a major impact on how many jobs are lost as the slowdown bites in 2009
3622744 the bank of england needs to address growing expectations of recession across the economy by cutting interest rates to boost business and the government needs to put more money in the pockets of public sector workers to raise flagging consumer confidence
3622745 the labour market data should show a faster pace of rising unemployment

3622887 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways

3622943 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

3622945 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3622946 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3622947 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3622948 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3622949 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3622958 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3622959 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3622971 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

3622976 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3622977 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3622978 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3622979 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3622980 the taxi driver noticed that the accused had a scarf around his face and thought this was unusual
3622981 the accused approached the counter and said open the till give me the money then made his way round to the side of the till and repeated the demand
3622982 when mr rees returned with the keys and the accused held a glass bottle in the air and told him to hurry up
3622983 he recognises it must have been a frightening experience for mr rees
3622984 this must have been a very distressing and upsetting incident as far as mr rees is concerned

3622986 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized

3622992 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3622993 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3622994 the cabin is one of 200 artifacts that were offered to us through the fbi the unabomber is an interesting case of the combative sometimes cooperative relationship of the press with the fbi
3622995 the cabin had a definite media hook since the artifact was provided by the fbi and we think it is a dramatic way of retelling the story to visitors we intend to keep it as part of the exhibit
3622996 im not sure how we top britney opening the show
3622997 the pattern of attacks three in a row during the games with security forces on high alert is an act of defiance that is unparalleled in recent xinjiang history
3622998 the global focus on china is an opportunity for people who believe their plight is ignored and invisible to take action
3622999 the concern here is that at a minimum this is going to add volatility to the region and polarize the uighur and chinese communities
3623000 there is also a fear the government will launch a widespread indiscriminate repressive campaign targeted far beyond the groups advocating use of violence
3623001 we can see that the attackers are merciless fugitives so the government should be on high alert
3623002 because they cannot carry out such attacks in their most desirable cities like beijing they have to turn to local locations
3623003 their methods are quite similar to some other international terrorist attacks
3623004 at the moment it is unclear what was in the two safes and thats subject to investigation

3623007 if rangers had still been in europe i think carlos would have stayed for another season
3623008 he would probably have liked another go at the champions league after all he isnt going to get that at aston villa
3623009 but with rangers out so early and with no uefa cup football either he must have thought it was time to go its a major blow because no team likes to lose their best players and he had a great season for us

3623013 one of the most often documented facts is that married people are healthier than non married people but the difference between married and unmarried people has changed over the past few decades
3623014 in general marriage tends to make people healthier happier and richer and thats especially true for men
3623015 an important potential reason is that never married men have greater access to social support now than they did in the past it used to be that having a spouse was important for social support and a social network
3623016 if you get married and then divorced that will hurt your health
3623017 this study provides confirmation that marriage does tend to make people healthier they didnt look at the quality of an individual marriage but that being married is more likely overall to make you happier than not being married

3623027 people in the us are not only looking for more efficient vehicles but are also driving less and turning to public transport car pools and even bicycles
3623028 this trend could well mean that us petrol demand may have peaked in 2007 even if retail prices ease it seems unlikely that people who have bought a smaller car will revert to gas guzzlers despite the numerous incentives offered by the auto industry lower fuel demand shows people are shunning travel

3623033 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
3623034 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function

3623048 it was a bad call simple as that they dont make many but that was a bad call in my view
3623049 it may have been small in military terms but it was of vast importance you have to be there and have a presence on the ground if youre serious about it
3623050 we appreciated the importance of the situation faster than most other news outlets and adrian blomfield our moscow correspondent was in georgia on the ground and filing quicker than anyone else

3623055 i could no longer give the coach a guarantee that i would still be playing football after my one year contract with stuttgart expires i therefore suggested that they no longer include me in their plans
3623056 the entire experience was wonderful the retreat was truly an inspiring and love felt event there were a couple of activities i was too tired to attend but i felt absolutely no pressure i was very satisfied

3623063 we are happy that after a long search for a good coach to replace kadiri ikhana we have found one who will continue from where the former coach stopped
3623064 after the unveiling ceremony we will start registering the players for next season and from then things will take shape
3623065 we are going to have a strong team next season and the management is ever ready to motivate the players to give their best

3623092 it means that there is no opportunity for the ccc or other interested parties to consider this version before submissions close
3623093 the ccc submits that this is a cynical exercise in regulatory gaming by telstra that is so blatant that it demands that the government finally step in
3623094 the ccc has in the past argued that there were two courses of action open to the government to immediately close this gaming opportunity the first would be to allow the commission to amend an undertaking into a form that it found acceptable the second would be to remove the undertakings provision from telecommunications altogether
3623095 the ccc submits that interested parties can have no confidence that the telstra is engaged in anything other than a sham designed to distract resources and attention of the industry and the regulator
3623096 the ccc has long argued that telstras motivation in presenting serial undertakings to the commission has been directed at gaming regulatory processes rather than seeking to legitimately provide prices terms and conditions that can resolve disputation in the industry

3623108 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes

3623117 last year we did not have one player make our raptor club which is our top level of performers in certain physical tests we conduct
3623118 this year we had eight players make it and several others who were close
3623119 we believe we can compete this year and continue to build the program
3623120 if i didnt enjoy it id be sitting at home
3623121 we lost four players to injury in the first game last year and for us thats like losing eight starters
3623122 if we can stay away from injuries we can have a successful campaign
3623123 the decision was based purely on numbers on performance and carpenter has outperformed him right now thats the bottom line
3623124 we chart a ton of categories with the kickers and carpenter has outperformed him
3623125 you get to a certain point in the season when a season cant be reclaimed in terms of numbers
3623126 but were happy we have this opportunity to get him as close to being fixed as soon as possible
3623127 as he came back to the dugout i put my fist out and i said dont worry about it
3623128 he thought that meant i wanted him to go inside and i didnt think any more about it until juan pierre told me ramirez took all his bats and went in

3623130 the prospect of countries ranging from the united states and china to japan and saudi arabia together with the worlds terrorists vying for physical control of the worlds oil does not sound like a prescription for global security
3623131 our analysis shows that if the two countries china and india were to use as much oil per person as japan does today their demand alone would exceed current global oil demands and if their per capita claims on the biosphere were to match those of todays europe we would need a full planet earth to sustain these two countries
3623132 unless we find a couple of spare planets in the next few decades neither of these projections will come to pass we therefore face a choice rethink almost everything or risk a downward spiral of political competition and economic collapse

3623146 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers

3623162 its all about getting a balance i think that foreign players are good for the game
3623163 its just about the number at the moment im a little bit concerned about the number of foreign players
3623164 ideally i would like that number reduced to about four four real quality players that have an impact in terms of their professionalism and what they bring to a training session
3623165 qpr are preparing a bid for 26 year old italian striker davide succi who currently plays for ravenna in the italian third division
3623166 i told my agent i dont want to go up north or play for any other team in this league and if you can make that possible ill give you a big kiss
3623167 i was getting the vibes from the management that i wasnt in their plans and i was telling my agent that if things dont happen down here theres only one place i want to go thats what he did and its happened
3623168 the whole year at fulham i dont think i was even on the training pitch it was pretty much a write off season down there
3623169 i was still two months away from playing when lawrie sanchez was given the sack and when roy hodgson came in he signed seven or eight players so it was always going to be difficult for the players signed by sanchez to get into the team
3623170 i was disappointed i didnt get a chance to show what i can do at fulham but the ultimate dream has always been to play here at qpr in the premier league
3623171 it was always going to be difficult for me going back after charlton to break into the fulham team no matter how well id done in pre season and i was training well and playing well i couldnt do any more really
3623172 it was a case of hes got his players down there and i wasnt going to be given a chance
3623173 now i want to consistently perform like the season i was here before i left youve got to be consistent home and away because its such a tough division
3623174 if i can put the performances in and the gaffers happy with me thats all i can do and if my other team mates can do it too well be up there
3623175 when i came here with charlton the reception i got when i came off left my grandad and dad up in the stands with a tear in their eye
3623176 it was so emotional with 17 or 18 thousand chanting my name it was mad
3623177 ive got a special relationship with the fans and im hoping to entertain them this year
3623178 im so happy to be back down here and its exciting times ive come here on loan with a view to a permanent move and in my eyes im here for the next three years
3623179 youve got to believe you will play in the premier league or its not going to happen before i used to think it but now its closer to that dream with these owners the club deserves another crack at the big time and hopefully im part of that
3623180 i expected changes here because bernie and flavio ecclestone and briatore dont muck about but when you see it for yourself its quite amazing
3623181 i enjoyed every minute of my time at dinamo i was asked to stay on for another season and while the contract was very tempting i just had this sense that it was best i didnt stay
3623182 ive still got a lot of good friends in the city who ive been in touch with on a daily basis
3623183 the phones into the city for now are still working and ive also been able to send text messages to a few of the team
3623184 i was told just this morning that while the russian soldiers havent reached the capital yet it could be only a matter of time the players at dinamo have told me they can see and hear the bombs going off in the mountains above tbilisi
3623185 there is a military airport very close to the stadium and an army base as well my former team mates say the situation is worsening by the hour
3623186 the tension between georgia and russia had been coming for some time
3623187 ive got a wife irena and two kids a daughter aged nine victoria and a two year old son matteo to think about

3623192 you have to go to about five places to get a deal you really like
3623193 you can be so aggressive in china shouting and pointing and saying this is a completely crap product but i still want it for a cheap price

3623199 the accc acknowledges the role that regional banks have played in challenging the major banks particularly as they have entered new states and competed aggressively to gain market share he added
3623200 maybe i havent looked into it deep enough but if youre talking about a country where theres no golf courses and golfs an expensive game to take up i dont see how having it as an olympic sport is going to change anything
3623201 with how the schedules go for guys i dont know how theyll fit it in obviously this week is the olympics and they just had the pga what are they going to change the date of a major
3623202 i think you have to go one of two ways you either have to get the best u s professional players or you get the best amateur players one of the two
3623203 i dont think it would work well if its like the world cup has been the last couple times where guys dont want to go play so you dont have the top ranked players at the time going i dont think that would be any good
3623204 when i first started in spring practice i worried he said
3623205 any little thing would scare me now i dont think about it it feels like it never happened
3623206 we think hes going to be fine and play a ton of football said co offensive coordinator steve shankweiler who coaches the offensive line
3623207 hes much further along than he was in the spring
3623208 that was hard to take that i would have to live without football he said
3623209 as a child he always wanted to do the right thing
3623210 terences faith patience and perseverance tells a lot about his character armen said
3623211 hes an extraordinary young man and hes getting a second chance at life
3623212 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
3623213 please save the last bit of trueness in our children
3623214 they think yang peiyis smile is not cute enough what we need is truth not some fake loveliness i hope the kids will not be hurt this is not their fault
3623215 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially during the entrance of our national flag
3623216 the way he was playing he would have been the starter at safety for us thats the way he was going its a big loss for us right now
3623217 the one big glaring thing right now is weve got to find somebody who can run the football coach david cutcliffe said
3623218 the loss of requan certainly put a big damper on our running game
3623219 tony is leading because hes been here the longest but he has not had a lot of practice said cutcliffe who switched jackson from defensive back late in spring drills
3623220 nobody has asserted themselves at all to this point im scouring the team to try to find who can help us at that position
3623221 i need a guy when there are three yards or four yards he gets four yards said cutcliffe noting that harris showed that grind it out grit until he got hurt
3623222 ive got to find us a couple of running backs
3623223 thad had his best day hes doing a good job getting a grasp of the offense managing the offense
3623224 zack continues to make big plays what zack has to show is more consistency putting us in the right play and throwing the ball hes capable of doing that if he challenges himself to make his mechanics consistent
3623225 we got what we wanted out of this scrimmage said cutcliffe who was intently focused and vocal and kept his devils fired up
3623226 we work out together so while everyone else is standing up im just sitting there you know expecting it she does it whenever she feels good
3623227 as long as she stays healthy then she will have more opportunities to play on this olympic stage
3623228 we didnt really talk too much on her recruiting visit
3623229 oh no i just tell candace she should have come to duke she could have seen him all the time
3623230 im trying to absorb everything the opening ceremonies our first game and live every moment
3623231 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3623232 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3623233 it was confirmed that previously recorded footage of fireworks was provided to the broadcasters for convenience and theatrical effects as in many other big events
3623234 on the day of the ceremony there were actual footprints of fireworks from the south to the north of the city however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded footage may have been used
3623235 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3623236 just like skip we were fans of the team in the lean years in the 70s and the 80s

3623242 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3623243 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3623244 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3623245 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3623246 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3623247 thats whats at stake when russia engages in behavior that looks like its from another time

3623291 however our study shows that the crucial feature is being outdoors irrespective of the activity you are doing
3623292 our results show that the protective effect of time spent outdoors persists even if a child is doing a lot of near work such as reading and studying
3623293 promoting outdoor activity to parents and families and including more outdoor pursuits in school curricula could be an important public health measure to avoid the development of myopia

3623347 the comments of greg conti the us military academy professor in las vegas last week highlight the problems that the it security industry will face in the next few years if as the experts are predicting companies move on up the efficiency and financial benefits that cloud computing will bring them
3623348 conti pointed out that early examples of this technology such as the simple web based email services offered by google and others are difficult to secure when using standard web interfaces but isaca believes that with the right technology these problems can be solved
3623349 whilst there is no such thing as a totally secure system especially a system that is accessible across the internet our belief at isaca is that with the right technology the new generation of cloud computing system can be made as secure if not more secure than existing server based office systems
3623350 clearly cloud computing adds to these issues but with the right technology in place isaca believes that the security issues associated with this brave new networked world can be surmounted even if the process takes a little time
3623351 while we are confident scotlands economy is well placed to address the challenges presented by the current economic climate the scottish government will do all we can to support key industries like the energy sector which has the potential to make a significant contribution towards our goal of increased sustainable economic growth despite international challenges
3623352 the value of our oil is an all time high yet we have still to reap the full benefits of our natural resources
3623353 a scottish oil fund a concept supported by over 80 per cent of people in scotland can deliver direct and long term benefits
3623354 we are making great strides in becoming a world leader in renewable energy and have the potential to generate 10 times scotlands peak demand for electricity
3623355 in the last few weeks we have announced a new biomass plant at markinch an extension to crystal rig windfarm and the creation of europes largest windfarms in south lanarkshire an investment of around 800 million in wind and biomass
3623356 earlier this year we launched the largest ever single prize for marine renewable energy the 10 million saltire prize with the support of the national geographic society we will pursue the most innovative ideas to maximise scotlands full marine potential
3623357 these are just some of the achievements and developing opportunities for scotland it is the full energy mix which can give scotland an economic and competitive advantage in spite of global economic pressures
3623358 the national conversation offers us a chance to debate what kind of country scotland can be and the opportunities we can pursue the energy sector its future and prosperity is a key part of this debate and our vision for the future and i would urge everyone to get involved and have their say

3623380 there are twin advantages of this proposal first we can save about half of our food grain stocks by catching and eating rats and secondly we can improve the economic condition of the musahar community
3623381 rats have almost no bones and are quite rich in nutrition people at large dont know this cuisine fact but gradually they are catching up
3623382 yes that proposal is in its advance stage and well very soon engage them in various social activities of our department

3623385 madonnas representatives have been visiting the girl the adoption is now advanced all the government is waiting for is madonna to forward the petition of adoption formalities
3623386 then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
3623387 the adoption process in malawi is so long and stressful that all the legal wrangling put a huge strain on their marriage
3623388 they dropped proceedings to pour all their energies into each other but madonna now feels they are stable enough to press ahead with the adoption again
3623389 we know that it is mercy who madonna really wants we heard it is because my granddaughter is such a beautiful happy child
3623390 twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country
3623391 but they keep on at us now they say that mercy will be leaving us but can return at age 18 yet i might not be alive then

3623395 russia had been close to us for years it will defend us the us and europe wont
3623396 why did saakashvili take on russia with 10 000 soldiers maybe he was thinking somebody would help us but nobody did help us
3623397 he was covered in blood there was no time to find out but he wasnt moving
3623398 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3623399 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3623400 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3623401 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3623402 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3623403 this transition of leadership at our heritage brand is taking place at an exciting time of evolution for ann taylor i am delighted that christine a seasoned retail executive and valued partner to me over the last several months will be assuming the leadership of our ann taylor stores division she has a deep understanding of our brand and customer base and will move seamlessly into this critical role at the same time i want to thank adrienne for the many contributions she has made to the company over the past 17 years
3623404 i am delighted to be joining the company at such an exciting time and i look forward to unlocking the enormous potential of the ann taylor brand

3623413 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3623414 the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
3623415 im glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this games would have been remembered for unfortunately
3623416 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it
3623417 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out

3623436 its a piece of information that supposedly gives you some idea of what that person is like as a human being
3623437 theres absolutely no evidence that you can predict batting average by blood type or that there are different character traits that you can define by blood type

3623444 scientific obstructionism is judged on these specifics electronic interpretation and quantum mechanics
3623445 a marked distinction separates men who profess to be disciples followers of christ and adherents of the bible and those who profess to be outside christianity called unbelievers
3623446 for the invisible things of him god from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they men who hold the truth in unrighteousness are without excuse
3623447 because when they knew god everyone has known god at one time in his or her life they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools
3623448 could hardly see how anyone ought to wish christianity to be true for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe and this would include my father brother and almost all my best friends will be everlastingly punished and this is a damnable doctrine

3623452 scientific obstructionism is judged on these specifics electronic interpretation and quantum mechanics
3623453 because in reality i find real science difficult and too shattering of my religious indoctrination to accept its active obstruction of my beliefs leads me to challenge it by arbitrarily selecting two metrics upon which i place immeasurable weight so that if or when as i see it the obstructing party fails one metric or the other the guilt of the offending party is obvious
3623454 its very weird that everyone can mock and taunt this book when no one has read it yet
3623455 the orion molecular cloud is a site of particularly active star formation within our galaxy
3623456 several thousand stars have been born in this region in the last million years which is very recent from the cosmic perspective
3623457 for reasons that arent entirely understood when stars are born their birth is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust when this outflowing material eventually impacts the surrounding gas the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas the water we observe is rapidly produced in this warm dense gas
3623458 an enhanced concentration of water is precisely what we expected in this gas cloud
3623459 we are looking at a region of interstellar space where shock waves have made the gas abnormally warm for the past 25 years astrophysicists have been predicting that whenever the temperature exceeds about 200 degrees fahrenheit chemical reactions will convert most of the oxygen atoms in the interstellar gas into water and thats exactly what weve observed in orion
3623460 the interstellar gas cloud that we observed in orion seems to be a huge chemical factory generating enough water molecules in a single day to fill the earths oceans sixty times over
3623461 eventually that water vapor will cool and freeze turning into small solid particles of ice similar ice particles were presumably present within the gas cloud from which the solar system originally formed it seems quite plausible that much of the water in the solar system was originally produced in a giant water vapor factory like the one we have observed in orion

3623472 what keeps me strong today is the knowledge that my child did not walk into prison this morning tuesday a broken young man
3623473 and when he walked away i was consoled by the knowledge that my child has inexorable faith in god and that we and he know that he is innocent
3623474 in the past seven years i have shed many tears enough tears to fill a stream during this time many things were said and written about my child that hurt me deeply but so much of it was not true
3623475 i am christoffs mother i know he is not a murderer and i know that the truth will come out god does not sleep
3623476 the untruths and distortions over the years must be stopped somewhere and then the country will hear the truth when christoff and the others were initially accused of murder they were still young children
3623477 at the time they obviously did not know exactly what was going on and maybe they saw being prosecuted as some kind of cheek but in the meantime theyve grown and become adults
3623478 christoff gradually realised the seriousness of the matter but it did not break him how can something break you if you know that god is with you as parents we are also not broken
3623479 we know that gods will will come to pass and he knows that my child did not commit murder
3623480 this morning tuesday when we took him to the place where he had to report we were a lot of people someone there said that there arent usually so many people with someone who comes to report for prison
3623481 it proves that we his parents his fianc e his brother and his friends stand by him in spite of everything
3623482 you ask what it feels like for me as a mother to be physically deprived of my son for the duration of his prison sentence im telling you that well never be away from him physically of course were going to visit him as often as possible
3623483 funny you know out of everyone that said goodbye to him this morning christoff was the strongest hes been like that throughout
3623484 of course he whispered a special message in my ear when i said goodbye to him thats how he is always full of special messages but no hes no softie
3623485 he needs to be punished not only for my son but for chris
3623486 two innocent kids another innocent boy hes not so innocent now
3623487 i was chasing every ambulance there was thinking maybe he was in there they wouldnt tell me for three hours that he was gone i wanted to be there for his last breath
3623488 i just really hope justice is served for dave and chris
3623489 we are anxious to get our voters out this year we have great candidates and the final analysis is going to be an exciting election to get out and vote

3623499 im coming over right now don and you had better start saying your prayers
3623500 however if anything were to qualify as a hate crime to us this seems like this might be it
3623501 to send a message to not just mr cook but the whole community that this kind of really complete sacrilege will not be tolerated

3623508 acho que me despedi da melhor maneira poss vel eu encerro minha passagem satisfeita acho que cumpri o meu papel
3623509 eu espero estar na pr xima vou estar mais experiente e espero poder passar pras mais novas o que as meninas passaram pra mim
3623510 a s rie n o foi t o boa quanto eu esperava eu estava um pouco nervosa no in cio
3623511 eu acho que dava pra ser melhor mas fazer uma final pela primeira vez n o f cil ainda mais com tr s meninas que nunca tinham ido para uma olimp ada

3623533 anybody who has bought a property at one of these sites is being kept up to date but this is an issue between us and the buyer the reason is the downturn in the housing market

3623535 interest in the quayside apartments is already huge and its easy to see why you just cant beat the location it is superb

3623538 when you have a problem scene you cant solve it by hopping around on one foot
3623539 i wanted to pepper that kind of imagery through it in ways that were not heavy handed but were just available for the person who recognizes it to enjoy another layer of meaning

3623544 i think its incredibly enriching to share the same passion about something
3623545 kerry and i try to keep it low key enough so were not going insane
3623546 their motivation is for the group for the play for the love of what we do
3623547 and it maybe sounds a little corny but its the truth and hopefully my saying it isnt going to jinx it
3623548 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3623549 theres a swing in mood from supply concerns to falling demand particularly in the united states but attention is beginning to turn to europe and asian economies as well
3623550 all in all we are maintaining a bearish trading posture in quest of additional price weakness to the 108 area a level that appears achievable by weeks end
3623551 the crop report is showing theres a little better crop than they thought at least projections are were still long from harvest but i think the projections were for a better crop in spite of the flooded acres

3623556 setelah balapan di laguna seca saya kembali ke australia dan menghabiskan waktu bersama istri dan keluarga jauh dari lintasan saya menggunakan waktu untuk beristirahat tapi juga tetap berlatih keras dan sekarang saya tak sabar menunggangi motor lagi
3623557 brno adalah lintasan yang menyenangkan walau banyak menuntut seperti di mugello dan phillip island dua favorit saya di kelas 250 cc saya naik podium dan tahun lalu kami menang jadi dengan penampilan motor belakangan ini kami seharusnya bisa bertarung mendapat hasil bagus lagi

3623570 what are you pawning off on us this time foster
3623571 found the guy passed out at the wheel parked not so carefully in that building right there with the engine still running
3623572 he just started complaining of a chronic back problem the moment i told him he was under arrest
3623573 still i need you to check him out and clear him medically
3623574 if you want him cleared take him to the er yourself
3623575 is that the meager diagnostic skills and equipment of borg paramedics are not sufficient to indemnify the big city police department against civil liability if we do clear this man medically and he does indeed turn out to have a medical condition that is aggravated by sleeping on a thinly padded concrete bench in the drunk tank what would effectively absolve you of responsibility is if someone with md after their name pronounces him fit to spend a night in the drunk tank what we can do is examine him and pronounce him stable enough to take a five minute trip in the back of your cruiser down to big city er where they can examine him further
3623576 only a doctor can do that and you can take a drunk to the hospital just as easily as we can youll be in and out in twenty minutes tops by then the donut shop might even have a fresh batch of eclairs
3623577 so we can tell our dispatcher that we were canceled by the police department right
3623578 aaaauuuuuugggghhhh my back muhfucka i got a back condition aaaaauuuuugggghhhh
3623579 cant examine you lying there in the police car sir
3623580 so you said sir however im not crawling into the back of that car with you youll have to get out here if you want us to examine you
3623581 sounded to me like he said due to the physical limitations imposed by my medical condition i would greatly appreciate your assistance in exiting the vehicle didnt it foster

3623588 no doubt you are a concentrated can of badass sir if wed have had more soldiers like you vietnam would be full of nail salons staffed by american girls its no wonder the army took you in at such a young age

3623612 this chick better behave herself with bp or getting mauled by a rottweiler is gonna feel tame in comparison
3623613 woman comes home drunk starts showing her ass and busting up the furniture so her fianc locks her out of the house she wants back in so she kicks out her living room window
3623614 shes got an itty bitty cut on her lower left leg but she bled like a stuck pig she smeared blood over half the carpet in the house
3623615 and she was walking around the house stark naked i made her put a shirt on
3623616 i coulda supervised while she looked for some clothes to put on
3623617 ill go with you she might still be dangerous or something
3623618 im bp of borg maam you wanna put your clothes back on while i talk to you for a little bit
3623619 uh maam you sure you dont want to go get that stitched up
3623620 we could help you walk out to the ambulance and
3623621 and her little boy had to witness all that scarred for life ill bet
3623622 they make these little incisions under the armpits and they fill em once they have the implants in place
3623623 my mother had no sense of personal decorum either she walked around naked more than once and i turned out all right then again my mother looked like ernest borgnine if shed had emerson biggins sign like that chick i may have gone further in life
3623624 ive never been jealous of a five year old before
3623625 i much prefer real over fake then again if you squint your eyes real hard and the light is just right
3623626 looks like we just unwittingly stumbled into the middle of a high speed chase
3623627 nice night for a little run aint it youre looking a little peaked there foster need some oxygen or perhaps a donut
3623628 hes got a little knot on his head and a nosebleed and well need yall to check him out before we take him to jail for processing
3623629 you know its a borg policy that we dont remove taser barbs right so if they ask
3623630 i tell them that were not allowed by company policy yeah i got it
3623631 happy birthday dude you know we all were wondering what to get you but youre a hard man to shop for what do you buy for the man who has everything he can steal all the cops figured theyd chip in and get you something you really needed hope you enjoyed your ass whipping dude it came from the heart
3623632 can you take out the taser barbs before yall go
3623633 this is a night of firsts for me not only am i involved in my first police pursuit ever but i have also met the first individual ever who actually looks worse than his drivers license photo
3623634 cuffs look loose enough to me dude not like theyre cutting off your circulation or anything
3623635 hold on there sport i can loosen those for you
3623636 id have given him a 10 but he didnt keep his toes pointed and his feet together
3623637 looks like he pulled the taser barbs out at least
3623638 when were told to stage outside the scene until law enforcement arrives it behooves us to park somewhere
3623639 this was the only place to park thats still close to the scene
3623640 yeah but all those people standing there flashing the gang sign of the international bystander society are wondering why the bolance be parked across the skreet and not comin to pick up their homey its bad public relations
3623641 one arm pointing at the ground and the other arm waving frantically
3623642 its at a friggin convenience store bp customers are still walking in and out how dangerous can it be
3623643 im ad of borg sir can you tell me what happened
3623644 if you didnt such an honest uh face id say somebody kicked your ass
3623645 he says leroy johnson beat him with his fists i saw the whole thang too
3623646 he brung me up here to pay mah phone bill and get a carton of newports and when i come out tha sto leroy had him on the ground jest a beatin on him
3623647 i tole him ta call the po po but he aint want me to so i jest called tha amma lance instead
3623648 lets get you to the hospital where they can wire your face back together
3623649 well you just let the medics take care of you and ill take your statement at the hospital your lady friend gave us a description and an address so were gonna go arrest this leroy johnson character
3623650 whuddafuck you mean aimpebbish nochobbish dude he caved your fuckin face in youre looking at tens of thousand of dollars in medical bills
3623651 youre not looking to deal out some street justice yourself are you
3623652 because youre too old for that kind of foolishness and youre going to be in the hospital for a long time you aint going home tonight felix
3623653 look this aint like some bar fight where you buy each other a beer afterwards and then go hit the titty bar together
3623654 somebody beats you as bad as he did he was trying to do you permanent harm felix he needs to be punished
3623655 and god will indeed judge leroy johnson but if the bastard had beaten me like that id be trying to arrange the meeting as soon as possible
3623656 ill be in to see you in just a moment mr lejeune
3623657 so any loss of consciousness presumably the cops are on their way here to take his statement and document his injuries
3623658 and the parish deputies are on their way here not that itll do much good
3623659 i rode in with the man and we chatted i believe i have gotten a glimpse into his heart my guess is he was sitting out in the parking lot drinking a wholesome glass of milk and holding his daily devotional with his good friend and fellow christian leroy there ensued a spirited theological debate perhaps over differing interpretations of church doctrine things got heated and it erupted into regrettable violence obviously a christian man doesnt go bust a cap in someones ass when such disagreements inevitably occur a christian man forgives and turns the other cheek and i think its obvious that felix lejeune is a fine christian man you should both be ashamed of thinking so poorly of him
3623660 or it could have been a drug deal gone bad

3623665 the sufa nahal oz and erez crossings were reopened this morning
3623666 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3623667 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3623668 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3623669 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3623670 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3623671 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3623672 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3623673 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3623674 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3623675 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3623676 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3623677 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3623678 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3623679 roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3623680 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and his values
3623681 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3623682 make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to our backgrounds
3623683 she focused primarily on issues that mattered to working families this was a strategy that was not employed discussed by senior staff or even pushed by mark penn
3623684 even if you concluded it would be a useful line of attack some of us were queasy about it
3623685 its fair to say that most people thought it would really rebound on her
3623686 the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century
3623687 many people believe under the surface that 20 years sitting there with goddamn america would make obama unelectable by itself
3623688 what does that say about his leadership that he never left or complained
3623689 we are in for a real fight but assuming she at least achieves the projections for tuesday and given some breaks it is a fight that she can win
3623690 the protest started around 12 30 pm and lasted five to seven minutes
3623691 the protest might be illegal but reporting was legal it was a gross violation of rules for reporting
3623692 this land absorbs the skins of martyrs this land promises wheat and stars worship it we are its salt and its water we are its wound but a wound that fights
3623693 i long for my mothers bread my mothers coffee her touch childhood memories grow up in me day after day i must be worth my life at the hour of my death worth the tears of my mother
3623694 ten people were killed and 24 were injured in the bombing
3623695 after the massive explosion at springfield avenue in west belfast in june 1982 in which local homes were devastated by the brits detonation of ira explosives which were being temporarily stored in the area and which the brits had uncovered the ira stated that the explosives had been unprimed and could have safely been removed from the area without detonating them that is the brits detonated the explosives in an attempt to discredit the ira in nationalist eyes
3623696 firstly i think its important to clarify the background to the explosion you mention
3623697 assaulting a british army patrol with an offensive weapon a yard brush
3623698 the statement made by ambassador khalilzad with regard to terror against the civilian population is absolutely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq afghanistan and serbia so if indeed we would like to find a military solution to this conflict then let us try to find serious political solutions and not indulge in propaganda even if perhaps some politicians would like that whatever your policy might be please do not undertake to engage in propaganda activities in the security council

3623700 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3623701 the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
3623702 im glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this games would have been remembered for unfortunately
3623703 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it
3623704 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out
3623705 it was like a circus out there it would have been a brave chinese judge that would have put his hand up to signify a miss
3623706 the position i finished in is well above the position i am in the world
3623707 unfortunately the chinese shooter was in front of me so i had to wait every time after he shot before the noise died down
3623708 i am not using this as an excuse but i dont have much opportunity to practice in front of a crowd of 10 000
3623709 but i have learnt a lot today it proves you can teach an old dog new tricks
3623710 nutriva grande venerazione e affetto per il segno del tau lo raccomandava spesso nel parlare e lo scriveva di propria mano sotto le lettere che inviava

3623739 because sustainable was an ambiguous term and because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that on this point the ad was misleading
3623740 this latest asa ruling against shell sets a benchmark for all advertisers about what is and is not acceptable when making environmental claims
3623741 this ruling makes it clear that advertisers need to be especially careful when using terms like sustainable because there is no universally agreed definition about what sustainable means
3623742 we pick our battles very carefully but this particular advertisement stood out as being something quite extreme
3623743 being sustainable should be a source of competitive advantage but it is being undermined by companies investing in green spin rather than genuine investments in their sustainability strategy
3623744 we hope that companies will look at the asa ruling and realise they are not going to get away with green spin
3623745 we considered that the department for environment food and rural affairs defra best practice guidance on environmental claims stated that green claims should not be vague or ambiguous for instance by simply trying to give a good impression about general concern for the environment claims should always avoid the vague use of terms such as sustainable green non polluting and so on
3623746 defra had made that recommendation because although sustainable was a widely used term the lack of a universally agreed definition meant that it was likely to be ambiguous and unclear to consumers because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that the ad was misleading
3623747 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise was wholly misleading
3623748 development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
3623749 meant helping to meet the worlds growing energy needs in economic social and environmentally responsible ways and that in all their operations they integrated economic environmental and social considerations into their business decision making
3623750 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3623751 if shell were serious about sourcing sustainable energy then they would be far better placed investing in renewable energy such as wind tidal or solar power

3623845 roy really wanted to do this for an entire year last year he just couldnt attend the st one so he made a promise to do it this year for the 2nd one and he kept the promise i forgot all about it to be honest but a week ago he said it was time i actually tried to discourage him because this is not an easy task but he insisted hed promised and it was his goal to do it and he did it now its a real miracle for me the entire year the three years has been a miracle you know i am an illusionist magic has been my entire life but with this now i feel and see real magic everyday

3623853 you know the truth is that right after 9 11 i had a flag pin on my lapel shortly after 9 11 particularly because as were talking about the iraq war that became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest
3623854 during rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart
3623855 i was taught by my grandfather that you put your hand over your heart during the pledge but during the star spangled banner you sing
3623856 when the united states has its armed forces in the field of battle a politician running for president raises many unnecessary questions by refusing to make simple expressions of devotion to the country he aspires to lead to not do so risks alienating important voter segments ones that mr obama can ill afford to lose perhaps when his opponent is john mccain a former vietnam war prisoner even obama will have to honor his rival as a legitimate war hero

3623866 you would think that frontloading then she found me with so much plot would make it play like a soap opera but hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways first she turns in a touchingly real performance the best of her big screen career and by directing then she found me helen becomes its savior as well

3623903 in the past food lion was about price but now they have morphed their image a little bit
3623904 before in some of our traditional food lion stores youd have an aisle of international products and the mexican hispanic would be one section of that weve taken that steps beyond
3623905 now that i can see it here i can say theres no more problem i will come more often
3623906 i feel extremely fortunate weve made sound business decisions that put replacements in a position to grow and continue to provide jobs to nearly 550 people at a time when other companies are struggling in todays tough economic climate
3623907 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing
3623908 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3623909 ballymoney has a lot slower pace of life than the big towns and its a very friendly place
3623910 clearly where you live is very important workplace home environment health and social services available whether the roads are safe and good community feeling
3623911 you cant find an answer to the question just by looking at the roscommon area
3623912 prices will continue to fall as the current environment is one of a loss of confidence increasing unemployment higher inflation and lower disposable income
3623913 overall house prices will be back on a rising trend in the latter part of 2009 and in 2010 though the extent of the gains will be in low single digits
3623914 he had a pop at me before the last dive i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone were still in the competition and weve got another dive to do
3623915 thats just thomas hes over nervous thomas should not be worrying about what im doing but he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform
3623916 we were out of character tom was nervous and thats what happens
3623917 certainly not so much for me im a little bit older than tom so i can take things on the chin a bit easier
3623918 he did really well for his age what he has done is great it is so good to even get to the olympics
3623919 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3623920 the kill switch is a very controlling gesture i am not sure why apple didnt disclose it up front as simply a security measure
3623921 consumers will accept an awful lot if you let them know what they are accepting
3623922 it has been horrible and it is still not very nice knowing that a brother son and father disappeared and we never had a last word with him
3623923 it is something we felt from the beginning that we were never going to find out because his remains were unrecognisable
3623924 all we were told was that it would be formally closed and that an open verdict would be announced
3623925 but we did not realise that we would be able to go and i must admit that i am rather disappointed with the whole set up
3623926 if it was not for the fact that we had a phone call from the eadt then we would have read about this in the newspaper
3623927 because the associated remains are so decomposed we have no ascertainable cause of death and because the cause of death is unascertainable there still remains unanswered questions into the sad circumstances in which he passed away
3623928 i can only record an open verdict as we do not have a cause of death
3623929 i would never go back on my word unless there was something in it for me
3623930 we dont care who gets the bailout we just like to give away borrowed money hey nancy they want more ok 800 billion
3623931 well while i believe in freedom and letting others grasp their chance for a better life we have two sides to this confrontation
3623932 im a little inorant towards this issue but id immagine people are against it because 1 its illegal 2when come under assumed names they dont pay taxes and stuff like that
3623933 well ben im glad you think so but ill leave the ranting to my rasta brother and his awesome communist beliefs

3623947 the one big glaring thing right now is weve got to find somebody who can run the football coach david cutcliffe said
3623948 the loss of requan certainly put a big damper on our running game

3623950 nobody has asserted themselves at all to this point im scouring the team to try to find who can help us at that position
3623951 i need a guy when there are three yards or four yards he gets four yards said cutcliffe noting that harris showed that grind it out grit until he got hurt
3623952 ive got to find us a couple of running backs
3623953 thad had his best day hes doing a good job getting a grasp of the offense managing the offense
3623954 zack continues to make big plays what zack has to show is more consistency putting us in the right play and throwing the ball hes capable of doing that if he challenges himself to make his mechanics consistent
3623955 we got what we wanted out of this scrimmage said cutcliffe who was intently focused and vocal and kept his devils fired up

3624047 the fact that most of todays up and coming designers have never used charcoal and a pad of paper doesnt bother me in the least
3624048 the use of computers in our firm has accounted for a five fold increase in productivity quality and sales volume computers allow our national media marketing design specialists a much a higher degree of efficieny and output furthermore since we can make more with less our overhead decreases dramatically and profits will skyrocket
3624049 we look at the work of others not because we want to copy it
3624050 but because we want to take away the best aspects of each national media marketing design and apply them to our own work
3624051 this means a lot to me personally weve worked so hard in this industry for years and finally it is starting to pay off big
3624052 because as interest and corporate demand for national media marketing art grows so will the talent base were going to see some great work from some of the top up and coming names in the business
3624053 i know there is no such thing as a quick buck but in 5 years when this national media marketing industry blossoms were going to see a lot of new rich people
3624054 the key to working on good national media marketing design pieces is patience and rote talent
3624055 like many of our employees i started with classical art training and drawing and slowly moved into the post modern area this succession greatly improved my national media marketing art and drawing skills
3624056 ive been a student of national media marketing design for almost 20 years now
3624057 and i cant say ive ever been more excited than now our new director wetzstein bonello promises to bring things to a much higher level and increase our output i realize this will mean more national media marketing design hours but this also means more money for all of us
3624058 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
3624059 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options

3624081 what id say to the commercial banks is this if youre registering in these economic circumstances a 7 per cent increase in profit and im all for our companies being profitable its a part and parcel of the market economy
3624082 but if youre a bank generating significant profits and commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families where working australians are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers

3624103 lojeski and reilly bring us something that readers of business books so rarely get no nonsense practical guidance on how to manage distance especially where it most often serves as an impediment to working effectively if you interface with widely dispersed team members who rarely see one another and communicate by virtue of impersonal electronics you may expect to find this book provocative counterintuitive and above all exciting it gives all of us who have to struggle while working with talent stretched across distance hope that maybe there are ways to do this right
3624104 a must read for global corporate executives who manage geographically dispersed job sharing teams practical strategies for preventing productivity loss and optimizing innovation the authors pull no punches in showing the real downsides to the virtual work phenomenon they have done a great service for us all

3624106 authors sobel lojeski and reilly have provided a useful primer for the harried executive striving for productivity improvements while seeing the workload expand and the workforce disperse using conceptual definitions of physical operational and affinity distance to describe the multifaceted dimensions of building teams of people to work effectively together the authors construct a very powerful set of metrics for a manager to improve the capability of his or her workgroup no matter where it resides or how it is composed the book is rich in anecdotes and specific studies that illustrate the concepts in an engaging pertinent and easy to understand manner in an age of outsourcing offshoring and decentralizing groups of people who have to get things done together reading this small book will repay itself many times over

3624123 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3624124 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3624125 the cabin is one of 200 artifacts that were offered to us through the fbi the unabomber is an interesting case of the combative sometimes cooperative relationship of the press with the fbi
3624126 the cabin had a definite media hook since the artifact was provided by the fbi and we think it is a dramatic way of retelling the story to visitors we intend to keep it as part of the exhibit

3624135 though decades of economic research suggest men and women are equalizing in the labour market the notion that todays working women are being paid more and treated better than ever before is simply wrong
3624136 the growing equality between genders reflects the entry of the most able women to the workforce rather than better pay
3624137 while there may be more women holding high power positions today they are still being paid as their counterparts were three decades ago

3624140 concentration on two venues will provide extra level of comfort for all stakeholders
3624141 during the recently completed asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt allow us the opportunity to check the security arrangements so there has been no way for us to formulate an opinion on the venue
3624142 security concerns had been high on the agenda for this champions trophy with players and boards from australia england and new zealand raising doubts as to whether pakistan should host the tournament sri lanka was put on standby as an alternative venue before pakistan was affirmed as host
3624143 what is clear from our visit is that there is a huge desire within pakistan as well as significant resources to turn that aim into a reality
3624144 our desire is to ensure that every stakeholder is content with arrangements and is comfortable with the icc champions trophy taking place in pakistan
3624145 we are committed to a safe and secure event in pakistan we believe these visits and the feedback we get from them will play a major role in us achieving those ends

3624152 in mn hoofd ben ik opnieuw klaar voor alle drie de afstanden ik moet natuurlijk afwachten hoe mijn lichaam reageert en we zullen het dag per dag bekijken maar ik zit in de beste vorm van het seizoen mijn doel is finales en als dat op twee afstanden lukt dan zal ik al heel tevreden zijn
3624153 more than one actor said to me this is actually fairly realistic kathleen i think they were fairly taken aback
3624154 when you have a problem scene you cant solve it by hopping around on one foot
3624155 i wanted to pepper that kind of imagery through it in ways that were not heavy handed but were just available for the person who recognizes it to enjoy another layer of meaning
3624156 its a little bit an ode to my mom just writing a little bit about the mother daughter relationship and the kind of really very elegant things she taught me about life attitude
3624157 youre writing from somewhere you should be writing from or i just need therapy
3624158 here i am directing a play i love so much thinking is it going to sell
3624159 were starting to be more solid there and with la mancha we dont know if its the show or were starting to burst out here its kind of almost overwhelming the response were getting right now
3624160 i think its incredibly enriching to share the same passion about something
3624161 kerry and i try to keep it low key enough so were not going insane
3624162 their motivation is for the group for the play for the love of what we do
3624163 and it maybe sounds a little corny but its the truth and hopefully my saying it isnt going to jinx it
3624164 it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3624165 these four had harmonies close as the most polished a cappella group on the planet
3624166 and i had to pick up my line and join in the jam session without missing a single beat
3624167 i had never in all my life spent so much of my time surrounded by people
3624168 the five of us against the world and no secrets ever
3624169 im the dude playing a dude disguised as another dude
3624170 you matter to me so im going to risk looking like a goofball and make the effort
3624171 vamos a mirar la belleza de los campos las flores quiero correr por los campos contigo quiero tomar tu mano y caminar yo quiero escucharte decir que me amas no tengas miedo por que yo se que nuestro amor no morira jamas jamas

3624174 im not going to sing cumbaya my lord and give her the veto
3624175 de afzwakking van de wereldeconomie is een feit dat heeft effect op ons land dat kan niet anders
3624176 en het kan nog wel meer dan 4 worden daardoor ligt stagflatie op de loer als die zich niet al voordoet
3624177 en ook gemeenten en provincies moeten de lasten niet verzwaren daarnaast moeten de vakbonden de lonen matigen en werkgevers de prijsverhogingen niet in zijn geheel doorberekenen aan de klant dat gaat wel ten koste van de winst maar dat offer moet worden gebracht en de europese centrale bank moet natuurlijk de rente verhogen
3624178 hieruit blijkt hoe moeilijk het is een goede online broker op te zetten die is afgestemd op de wensen van de particuliere belegger
3624179 ik heb een hoop vragen maar die mag ik pas donderdag stellen
3624180 de vierde cfo in zes jaar dus dat gaat lekker
3624181 de winst is weliswaar nog wat hoger dan vorige maand gemeld 10 5 miljoen versus zon 9 miljoen red maar van de breakdown word je niet vrolijk de samenwerking met gsfs heeft fors bijgedragen maar die doen veel in dividendspelletjes en dat loopt vooral goed in het tweede kwartaal maar het resultaat van brokerage stelt bijvoorbeeld niks voor

3624190 authorise the council or its agents to make enquiries to corroborate this claim
3624191 permit the council or its agents to inspect the property on request
3624192 day by day under labour the rights and liberties of law abiding citizens are being undermined with more and more state officials trying to enter and spy on peoples homes
3624193 it may be appropriate for local authorities to check that council tax discounts are not wrongly claimed but it is wholly disproportionate to threaten higher council tax bills if residents do not allow state officials into their bedrooms
3624194 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
3624195 so which is the better measure of inflationary expectations the spread between tips and treasuries or a spread between tips and a risk adjusted rate for all long bonds
3624196 the bank needs to bring up that ratio either through a capital contribution from the parent company or through higher earnings
3624197 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3624198 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
3624199 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

3624206 is to establish a strong bond with the georgian army train them proficiently and work in a safe training environment all while having a good cultural exchange
3624207 it is in a spirit of partnership for peace part of the nato program
3624208 we are conducting this exercise to enhance interoperability with a key coalition partner georgia has provided consistent support to ongoing operations in iraq georgia is the third largest force contributor to operation iraqi freedom and that means a lot to the united states
3624209 we will hopefully be able to say more this afternoon
3624210 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3624211 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3624212 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3624213 require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force
3624214 i really wonder why he did it he has only 10 000 soldiers and he takes on russia

3624218 well make sure their military will be so devastated that they will be in a non aggression situation whether they want it or not
3624219 to include more pro american oriented countries into the alliance
3624220 why did you tell your fellow citizens at the the rally that the russians were barbarians

3624226 we have talked about and investigated making these changes for about two years and we cant afford to not make them we had to move ahead or die
3624227 its a huge commitment and should be done by october or november hopefully it will encourage people to come and know they are welcome everyone is welcome but we would really love to see younger people join too
3624228 places like truro and pictou county where im from can be the beneficiaries of programs and projects aimed at having buses and that sort of mass transit available to people
3624229 with municipal services in there its going to spur development
3624230 this will complete the water system in bible hill for need at this time
3624231 its needed for our commercial area its needed for residents that are interested in hooking up to the municipal water system and i see it as progressive move for our village
3624232 all these projects being announced today i am proud to say are green projects that is they involve strategic investments in water and wastewater initiatives
3624233 when completed the project will ensure that wastewater from truros water treatment plant will no longer be discharged to lepper brook
3624234 well see in time if it meets a certain criteria if the funding is available from other levels of government that certainly helps in our decision making at the federal level
3624235 im aware of the project weve seen the plans this is in the mix if i can put it that way
3624236 were all glad to get it back and we appreciate what the rcmp did to get it back and the man who dropped it off
3624237 you could buy another one or have another made but to have the original one back it feels good
3624238 my guess is whoever did take it would have heard it on the news somehow and then they put it there hoping someone would see it and pick it up
3624239 i think its very nice of them to do that really

3624256 what this study shows is that doctors should be doing regular monitoring of these children over time because a one time checkup might not be enough to tell if they are at risk for developing diabetes
3624257 to better treat at risk children we need better ways to monitor beta cell function and visceral fat buildup
3624258 those are tough to measure but are probably the main factors determining who will get type 2 diabetes
3624259 the study provides great insight into the risk factors that lead to the progression towards type 2 diabetes in this population

3624269 a road map for the individual and their family to re enter the land of the living
3624270 a road map for the individual and their family to re enter the land of the living
3624271 in i will not be broken jerry white brings his insight and experience to bear expertly for those facing lifes unexpected challenges he embodies the spirit of survivorship
3624272 jerry white has written an amazingly poignant book but it does more than capture the collective experience of enduring a tragedy it provides a road map for the individual and their family to put one foot in front of the other and re enter the land of the living this book will be a remarkable tool especially for the many military families impacted by the wars in afghanistan and iraq
3624273 we can choose happiness even after the worst of times jerry white offers an excellent guide to navigating and overcoming the traumas we face in our lives
3624274 this is an important book jerry white shares lessons learned from his experience recovering from a landmine accident to help trauma victims recover survive and thrive
3624275 offers wise practical and inspiring steps to come back from lifes worst setbacks jerry white speaks with compassion and authority and an abundance of emotional intelligence
3624276 i have visited landmine survivors around the world with jerry white i have seen him reach out to others and walk with them on the path from victim to survivor his courageous personal experience is a beacon for all who are searching to recover and reclaim life
3624277 the tank and guns on tiananmen square crushed the hopes of a generation but many refused to stay victims we find new ways to find new hope when i met jerry white i instantly recognized a fellow survivor who understands what it takes to overcome obstacles to hope this book will inspire
3624278 this terrible thing has happened it cant be changed i cant rewind the clock my family still needs me so now what
3624279 i want to say yes to the future i want my life to go on in a positive way
3624280 how do i want to live the rest of my life what steps can i take today
3624281 how can i be an asset to those around me and not a drain will i ever feel grateful again
3624282 they say what doesnt kill you makes you stronger its not quite that simple i believe you have to decide it will make you stronger experience has taught me that happy endings can never be taken for granted they must be chosen
3624283 we are surrounded by survivors who have gone before us and their examples will help mark the way forward their experiences show us that with the right support everyone can recover and thrive as we overcome hardship there is laughter and hope and love waiting for each of us but it is crucial for us to want those things
3624284 is there really a way to grow stronger in crisis you bet there is i am convinced we not only can toughen under pressure but also soar why because i did and i have watched thousands of others transform tragedy into growth
3624285 because life will happen to all of us violence and terror can be visited upon just about anybody these days life explodes and nothing is ever quite the same im not just referring to a personal injury or illness but also to the world where headlines of terrorism violence and natural disaster assault us with increasing frequency some of us seek consolation in the belief that tragedy is happening somewhere else far away but eventually the bell tolls for you
3624286 i hope my story and those of friends ive met around the world will flicker light in the dark tunnel where too many people feel trapped in pain even better the survivor stories in these pages can teach all of us about moving forward all of us need to learn to manage lifes explosive moments life may change in an instant like mine did in israel but instead of dreading them i want to encourage all of us to honor our toughest dates the tragedies that bind us in an effort to transform victimhood into survivorship
3624287 over the past twenty years i have met and talked survival with everyone from the famous diana princess of wales elie wiesel king hussein and queen noor of jordan john mccain his holiness the dalai lama lance armstrong and the not so famous but equally strong katie ken elizabeth colleen and others each has something to teach us they dont just get by they thrive thats what i aspire to do
3624288 this book illuminates the path to survival five steps that can guide a person from tragedy toward a new life of renewed purpose and hope the steps are not always sequential they can be taken simultaneously they can also spiral skip and repeat survivorship is different for each individual but anyone who has overcome adversity and learned to thrive has come to understand the power of each step
3624289 princess diana understood that to survive means to endure something that could have killed you or taken you down like the loss of a son or daughter like stepping on a landmine these are experiences terrible and terrifying such trauma presents a threshold the outcome positive or negative is not pre ordained we can do things to foster resilience and strength going forward can you recall your date your own before and after moment when life is cut in two by horrible pain or shocking news
3624290 this terrible thing has happened it cant be changed so now what theres little point wishing you hadnt gotten into that car or gotten the tumor or been fired from that job we must face some brutal facts of the here and now its normal to question but you will never get a satisfactory answer and youll only waste time the past is the past and facts are facts
3624291 emotions are facts too but it is quite common to deny the initial experience this is not happening to me i will wake up from this nightmare soon it is also quite common to feel the most intense range of emotions after a loss or crisis
3624292 how can we use the facts that confront us with unpleasant truth to help us survive catastrophe facing facts is so hard because it demands that we come to grips with our worst fears it means admitting what we really think about disability deformity and death all scary stuff most of us would prefer to look away and carry on our merry way without thinking about these things but without a closer look in the mirror examining the wrinkles of our traumatized life we cant make sound decisions and then proceed to change and grow
3624293 crisis and pain can hold us hostage for a time but we still have a choice in how we will respond to our circumstances no matter how dire when something disrupts our life how do we move forward ive seen it time and time again in my work with victims of war atrocities there are those who fight for their lives after devastating loss and those who succumb to their suffering why the difference to truly thrive we must consciously choose for our lives to go on in a positive way i have had to do it more than once most of us have or will
3624294 by choosing life we step across the second threshold of survivorship it may be one of the hardest steps it requires imagination and perspective in the midst of pain it comes on the heels of brutal facts and a long look in the mirror to see who we are and where we stand how do you choose your way forward with scars and bitter memories you dont let your situation define you you reframe how to think about it you choose humor and connections and love you choose to live one of the essential ways we start to embrace life is by reaching out to others
3624295 no one survives on their own and no one thrives alone either yes you might feel an excruciating loneliness after one of lifes hurtful blows but we are simply not built to survive solo isolation will kill us not protect us we humans are social animals made for community even when family and friends annoy the hell out of us they remain an essential part of our survivorship
3624296 sometimes it feels as if we have no instruments we have no leader we have nothing thats when many of us call out to god for many it takes a crisis but in our darkest moments most of us will reach out spiritually its a cry for divine help we need someone anyone out there to understand our prayers reflect an existential plea for empathy in the universe i believe this is a great and useful thing i cant encourage people enough to pray and then pray some more call out reach out your questions and search for meaning are enormously important they reflect a desire to choose life and reach out simultaneously whatever you believe religion can offer a positive source of social and spiritual oxygen
3624297 i am always impressed by the strong bond among veterans including well known american prisoners of war in vietnam such as john mccain their military code of conduct inculcates an attitude of mutual survival with duty to country and to family when i first met senator mccain over lunch in the senate dining room i was immediately struck by his stubborn survivor spirit mccain credits his five plus years of perseverance in the face of torture to his sense of duty to and camaraderie with his fellow navy men and prisoners and a sense of honor instilled in him by the military careers and character of his father and grandfather
3624298 we benefit from belonging from contributing to a bigger thing called community we all have a role with talents and gifts to deploy each act of generosity seeds good will even by listening to another person tell their tale of woe thereby affirming their path you can help build community each of us is born with talents and gifts and they are meant to be deployed not for simple survival but for the good of the community a body is also a metaphor for community and if any one part is hurting the whole body is weak we need to shore each other up and make sure we acknowledge with appreciation people who pray forgive connect the unconnected and serve the more vulnerable among us
3624299 why do some people stay victims well its strangely comfortable a kind of defense mechanism after disaster strikes we welcome sympathy in our hour of need and then we invite it eventually we must break the victim habit and resume taking full responsibility for our future
3624300 im here to tell you that survivors are everyday people in the car next to you behind you in the grocery store next door mowing the lawn i meet these people everywhere from every walk of life on every continent i only wish i could share more of their stories i hope their examples will teach and inspire you to want to thrive just think if someone can overcome that level of crisis or abuse then maybe i can hang in there too just long enough to get through my crisis
3624301 life experience will nourish and make us stronger for example studies of emergency personnel indicate that having survived one traumatic experience increases resilience and in a sense inoculates workers who will face subsequent traumas at work most of us can point to early life experiences that afford us at least some practice in building resilience
3624302 what do survivors say has been helpful during their tough times
3624303 just be ready to pick up on the hints people in crisis my give as to what is needed at any particular time try to make it about that person and not your own hang ups or past traumas maybe your friend wants you to come by every day maybe its just once a week you must assess and reassess the situation be open be kind bring food then run the vacuum and wipe down the kitchen counters after putting the leftovers away in the fridge
3624304 i think grace in part is what allows survivors to bring meaning to our stories its available to all of us moments of awakening without meaning you may survive but you will never inspire and without meaning you cannot ultimately thrive finding meaning in our lives is a way to dispel darkness and break through the barriers that imprison us
3624305 we dont always have to look for larger than life heroes we can be heroes for each other we are just ordinary folk wanting to endure and live life well even during the rough patches but we can all benefit from role models who not only overcome adversity but find the wherewithal to give back and serve the broader community this is how we complete the cycle of survivorship transforming our tragedy and blessing others in the process
3624306 none of the survivors interviewed in this book would call themselves heroes or particularly courageous for that matter they simply did what they had to do
3624307 thrivers are all around us not distant in history or geography they are most often applied optimists pessimists can also thrive but they have to work a bit harder to push through their tendency toward negativity similarly introverts sometimes find it harder to thrive than extroverts given the need to reach out for support during and after a crisis the key is to know yourself so you can work with or compensate for your natural tendencies
3624308 the five steps on our survivor journey offer a way not just to recover not just to survive but to thrive step by step we find power to convert our dates the days that change us to become more than we were before the illness or the accident we understand survivorship is anything but linear its a process that involves three steps forward a flashback or two and then a leap ahead each of us is a mixed breed of survivor and victim some days we can exhibit healthy survivor behavior and then reveal less attractive victim behavior the next no one is perfectly resilient or consistent but we progress day by day step by step if we want
3624309 it is terribly sad to see young people absolutely devastated after experiencing a rape or a sexual assault while holidaying with friends abroad celebrating exam results or attending concerts here in ireland
3624310 in these particular incidents the young people we see at the centre are usually under 20 years of age and these experiences are very shocking for everyone involved
3624311 we are also issuing a warning to potential perpetrators that having sexual intercourse with a person without their consent constitutes rape
3624312 it is a violation of a persons human rights to take advantage of another person when they are in a vulnerable situation we urge that these crimes are reported and that the perpetrators are appropriately punished
3624313 after the tension and stress of the june exams and the anxious wait for the results students will be looking forward to celebrating on wednesday
3624314 we would encourage students to plan ahead and check out the drinkaware ie website to ensure their night is one to remember for all the right reasons
3624315 whatever the outcome having access to guidance professionals at the end of a telephone line to provide good counsel will help students refocus and find direction again
3624316 i am encouraging students to be positive and not to be too downhearted should the leaving certificate results not go according to plan

3624604 these days one comes across in different circles a surge of interest in history unfortunately very often what is happening is not a genuine study of history but mere reading into history in india it seems that there is an ever increasing trend to turn legends into history people turn to history in order to manipulate it and prove their own pre conceived ideas and positions but history itself gives us enough proof that sooner or later any such caricature of history will collapse under its own weight like sandcastles
3624605 one who is genuinely not interested to know the real past will be afraid of the future and all the more he will be confused about the present however we hope that these studies will provoke in the readers genuine interest in the early history of st thomas christians by publishing the research papers the book aims at inviting the historians and scholars to come forward with further research and study in these areas of kerala history especially early history of christianity in kerala

3624645 when you do any job you have to accept criticism if it was a problem for me i would have to change jobs immediately he has made his decision though still im sure
3624646 but its a question of when he wants to come back and that hes convinced about the decision
3624647 we can not keep asking him please come back please come back
3624648 we can only say our door is open we need all our players

3624660 there has been a lot of stress in the camp because of his situation they only went out last week he didnt send his 18 year old son david and he is relieved about that because he would have been conscripted straight into the army

3624685 india and the apostle thomas an enquiry with a critical analysis of acta thoma
3624686 on the broad fact that saint thomas the apostle according to the evidence of antiquity had preached the gospel and sealed his teaching by his martyrdom in india it should be taken for granted that if his tomb were to be discoverable anywhere it would naturally be found with in the limits of india proper yet this which in itself is but an historical aphorism has met with the strongest opposition ever since the portuguese first announced the discovery of his tomb at mylapoor this opposition has come first and chiefly from quarters which might cause an impartial historian who patiently investigates the whole history of case to consider the same as being rather the outcome of odium theologicum than arising from insufficient historical evidence a placible excuse for the general feeling of skepticism created by these writers was in part of offered by the want of previous historical knowledge shown by the portuguese authorities and writers in india who claimed to have discovered the body or the entire remains of apostle coupled with uncritical details once the opposition view arising from the doubt regarding the tomb was taken and ruthlessly exploited it was extended to the preaching of the gospel by the apostle with in the geographical limits of india and a widely extending prejudice was formed it is only in more recent times when men indifferent to that odium or guided by their familiarity with or their long researches in india approached the subject that they came to gradually to admit apostle mission to india and to consider the strong historical claim of mylapoor to be the possible site of his martyrdom and burial are not unfounded
3624687 lo in india are thy miracles o thomas and in our land is thy triumph and everywhere our festival
3624688 the sunburnt india thou has made fair a tainted land of dark people thou hast purified more than snow and white linen the dark bride of india thou has made fair and the cross of light has obliterated indias darkened shades
3624689 blessed art thou thomas the twin in thy deeds twin is thy spiritual power nor one thy power nor one thy name blessed art thou o thrice blessed city thou hast acquired this pearl none greater doth india yield blessed art thou worthy to possess the priceless gem praise to thee 0 gracious son who thus thy adorers dost enrich
3624690 first because of the blessing with which it was blessed by the creator of heaven and earth next because it was worthy of the treasure of the bones of the apostle thomas who was the first to acknowledge that our saviour is the lord god
3624691 in punishment by the cross was the suffering of this one he who is the true christ and god above and guide ever pure
3624692 let me not glory except in the cross of our lourd jesus christ
3624693 who is the true messiah and god above and holy ghost
3624694 what freed the true messiah the forgiving the upbraiding from hardship the crucifixion from the tree and the anguish of this
3624695 he that believes in the messiah and in god in the height and also in the holy ghost is in the grace of him who suffered the pain of the cross

3624792 the pentateuch is a synthesis of at least four traditions
3624793 some writers have mentioned that the ritual service used to be held on saturdays in the tradition of the jewish sabbath the portuguese described the nasranis as sabbath keeping judaizers
3624794 the people of constantinople and almost everywhere assemble together on the sabbath as well as on the first day of the week which custom is never observed at rome or at alexandria
3624795 for although almost all churches throughout the world celebrate the sacred mysteries on the sabbath of every week yet the christians of alexandria and at rome on account of some ancient tradition have ceased to do this
3624796 amongst them is a festival day agreeable to the ancient practice of the church
3624797 that they celebrate divine service as solemnly on the sabbath as on the lords day that they keep that day festival eating therein flesh and fast no saturday in the year
3624798 the second necessity for christians is that your majesty establish the holy inquisition because there are many who live according to the jewish law sabbath and clean meat and according to the mahomedan sect circumcision and abstinence from pork without fear of god or shame of the world
3624799 the synod doth command all the members thereof upon pain of mortal sin not to eat flesh upon saturdays
3624800 and there was evening and there was morning the first day
3624801 the armenians in hindostan have preserved the bible in its purity and their doctrines are as far as the author knows the doctrines of the bible besides they maintain the solemn observance of christian worship throughout our empire on the seventh day
3624802 how come this is used only in kerala outside jerusalem
3624803 in 1747 the impoverished syrian community of cochin wanted to send for their new bishop from basra in iraq but lacked the funds to do so
3624804 there is neither jew nor greek for ye are all one in christ jesus
3624805 and no other country or people not even the east syrian christianity claim thomas as their apostle
3624806 no one claims thomas to be their founder apostle except parthia india and china
3624807 several of the most ancient syriac writings such as the doctrine of addai the chronicle of arbela and the teaching of the twelve apostles record that saint thomas sent thaddeus and mari to preach to abgar ukkama the black king of the assyrians at osrhoene
3624808 according to ancient records thaddeus and mari went to preach to the assyrians at the bidding of thomas thomas later went and ministered to the assyrians living in parthia and in assyrian principalities and villages along its borders the liturgy used by the assyrians and chaldeans is believed to have been composed by the apostles thaddeus and mari
3624809 there is not the least trace of any tradition either among the syrians or among the indians concerning the original introduction of christianity into south india by the east syrians the east syrian bishops and patriarchs who ruled the indian church from the earliest times down to the sixteenth century never claimed that their forefathers were the apostles of south india they even explicitly recognized st thomas the apostle as the founder of the south indian church
3624810 not that i believe in either theory but both explain the use of syriac in kerala
3624811 come now and let us reason together saith the lord
3624812 i can equivalently say that if it was divinely ordained that we maintain our supposed jewish culture then we wouldnt have suffered the cataclysmic blow
3624813 nasrani levite community is like the priestly class of namboothiri
3624814 if we are to study the real influence of jewish heritage on the nasranis we should not be focusing much on the customs and traditions of these two groups because these can change over a period of time they are not static we should focus on certain unanswered questions which each nasrani needs to answer
3624815 the nasrani prayer books give over due importance to the patriarchs of old testament abraham isaac and jacob why i found it very strange
3624816 well why did our ancestors accept syriac if it was a foreign language
3624817 there is not the least trace of any tradition either among the syrians or among the indians concerning the original introduction of christianity into south india by the east syrians the east syrian bishops and patriarchs who ruled the indian church from the earliest times down to the sixteenth century never claimed that their forefathers were the apostles of south india
3624818 it is the constant tradition in the eastern church that the apostle thomas evangelized india and there is no historian no poet no breviary no liturgy and no writer of any kind who having the opportunity of speaking of thomas does not associate his name with india
3624819 i hope that one day i can have access to some real hard evidence to prove these stories that admittedly i want to believe
3624820 these kinds of questions concerns will definitely help people who are working on this to come out more precise on history with satisfying evidences
3624821 lets see some concrete evidence for a first century church cross altar anything in kerala
3624822 after considering all that has been said by learned men and critics on this place i am quite of opinion that the apostle does not mean babylon in egypt nor jerusalem nor rome as figurative babylon but the ancient celebrated babylon in assyria which was as dr
3624823 by your arguments all syrian christians whether in kerala or west asia have jewish origins
3624824 and jews were living in jerusalem devout men from every nation of those under the heaven parthians and medes and elamites and those living in mesopotamia
3624825 eastern christianity is heavy on maintaining a continuous link to the old rabbinic jewish faith
3624826 the syriac orthodox church and the church of the east derived much from the customs of the jews
3624827 especially with eastern forms of christianity e g the orthodox churches and their uniate counterparts the jewish origins really shine through
3624828 how about the fact that we were east syriac christians prior to the 16th century is that not evidence
3624829 the fifth century opens with an indian christianity which was in such a state of development that she is able to send her priests to be educated in the best schools of the east syrian church and to assist the doctors of that church in their revision of the ancient syriac translations of the pauline epistles
3624830 we never had whole scale destruction of properties by mongols or muslims
3624831 on the other hand do any of the kerala christian communities especially the knanaya practice ritual circumcision
3624832 circumcision points only to the semitic heritage as even the muslims are doing that
3624833 the observance of circumcision is no evidence for jewish heritage as it is observed by many christian traditions
3624834 i dont buy that our people would want to cover jewish origins
3624835 the nasrani gives higher emphasis to his brahmin heritage because since were coming from a caste centric society one naturally wants to identify with the
3624836 now touching upon a different matter which we have not so far discussed but yet relevant to our discussion is an area where i find the strength of our nasrani heritage being put to powerful use is by the malabari pentecostals
3624837 the man who follows christ in solitary mourning is greater than he who praises christ amid the congregation of men
3624838 outward looking we have to get our strength direction and thrust from our nasrani heritage john mathew
3624839 st thomas came to kerala and celebrated the syriac liturgy there

3624851 these earings are also said to be images of gods and crescent in honour of the moon god
3624852 as per the limited knowledge and informational database of most syrian christians and this is ignorance of history
3624853 the origins of the so called malabar christians is uncertain though they seem to have been in existence before the 6th century a d and probably derive from the missionary activity of the east syrian nestorian church
3624854 the difference of their character and colour attest the mixture of a foreign race their conformity with the faith and practice of the fifth century world equally disappoint the prejudices of a papist or protestant
3624855 the nestorians of india venerated st thomas as the patron of asiatic christianity and not of indian or kerala christianity
3624856 in this india there is a scattered people one here another there who call themselves christian but are not so nor have they baptism nor do they know anything about the faith nay they believe st thomas the great to be christ
3624857 our syrian christian church religious society would not have probably approved this name if it was after that manichean mani
3624858 i have already written a brief description on this community of jewish christian traders the first migrants in kerala under the title northist southist debate on another thread with references
3624859 among the terms by which the qumran community yahad referred to themselves was keepers of the covenant which appears in the original hebrew as nozrei ha brit from this term derives the word nozrim one of the earliest hebrew designations for the sect subsequently known as christians the modern arabic word for christians nasrani derives from the same source so too does the word narorean or nazarene which of course was the name by which the early christians referred to themselves in both the gospels and the acts of the apostles
3624860 you are right when you say that cephas is the hebrew version or syriac version of the name i mean to say that they just didnt transport the sound to the sister language instead they found the word meaning rock in the sister language and assumed that as that as the version of peter thanks for the suggestion
3624861 the knanaya claim to be genetically related to the hebrews
3624862 it is wrong to say that because they have l hapalog they are not hebrew or jewish this is fundamentally wrong by religion and religion anthropology and sociology
3624863 for you and me there is no difference between judaism and christianity it is not just my view but also those of several or thousands of jewish christians
3624864 i only meant that down through the past 1700 years the northists and the southists believed that the southists were of jewish heritage and hence even if any dna says that they are of japaneese origin then higher consideration should be given to matters of ones belief than on dna results
3624865 we are an endogamous community that had migrated from urha edessa in ce 345 and settled in the ancient port city of muziris kodungallur in kerala south india
3624866 i only meant that down through the past 1700 years the northists and the southists believed that the southists were of jewish heritage and hence even if any dna says that they are of japaneese origin then higher consideration should be given to matters of ones belief than on dna results
3624867 as stated all knanayas tested so far belong to l hgp and some of these have middle eastern matches from lebanon syria
3624868 could it not be that the two communities were simply descendants of two different migrations from the middle east
3624869 now i felt their forefathers cut thier foreign looks by marrying dravidan or local women at those early times it just my opnion

3624871 our sample currently has no cohesion and all our members diverge this is indicative of how diverse the nair paternal lines are but right now our sample size isnt statistically large enough to draw inferences
3624872 there is not doubt that we are a mixed community and you should accept that we do not have a homogeneous history
3624873 i can see a thomas kuzhiamplavil in syrian christian dna project his dna is tested as l i know the history of kuzhiamplavil family they claim that their first century convert was a namboothiri they also claim that their first century feminine side was jewish
3624874 check out the results of jewish dna as well and see how wide and varied their dnas are
3624875 and research should be done in a research institute like rajiv gandhi institute of biotechnology

3624902 amr son of matthew a nestorian writer who flourished about 1340 assemani bibl oriental tom iii p 580 hands down the nestorian tradition ibid tom iv p 34 regarding saint thomas in india his tomb stands on the peninsula meilan in india to the right of the altar in the monastery bearing his name the topographical details would denote information brought back by a pilgrim or merchant who had seen the place correctly enough mention is not made of the body but only of the tomb the church is implied while the altar and monastery are mentioned the position is fixed on the seaboard and a corrupt form of the name of mylapore is given
3624903 there were then nestorians in the town and province of karm n if they never left any intimation to posterity that the apostles tomb was in their midst it is unlikely any later suggestion will induce a scholar to place it there we owe it in fairness to the writer of the paper to add that having received from us a copy of the above passages he reproduced them by way of rectification in a note published in the indian antiquary 1904 p 31 under the heading miscellanea this phase of the question may now be considered closed
3624904 it is said that the syrian christians were sorely tried by a heathen conjurer the poet manika vachakar historians call him as a shivite revival person in the end of first millennium a figure after adi shankara who converted many nasranis to his sect and that 96 families yielded
3624905 this ethnic community has successfully maintained its unique identity over the last 1660 years by being very orthodox adherants of endogamy
3624906 the jewish and hindu communities are committed to the ancient traditions of judaism and hindu dharma respectively and have both in their own ways gone through the painful experiences of persecution oppression and destruction
3624907 for thousands of years we have marched on parallel causes and have now built bridges of cooperation between the two religions jews have lived in india for over 2000 years and have never been discriminated against this is something unparalleled in human history
3624908 it is a unique blend of jewish arab indian and many other people
3624909 now u guys want to connect you with jews since they dictates the economy of america and america is ruling the world
3624910 so that means according to some of you guys oral tradition of knanayas are forged and st thomas tradition is perfect right
3624911 use this simple theory to understand the origin of knanayas
3624912 white jews created a subcommunity called black jews and they mostly are with black skin compared to pure blooded white jews

3624948 for mccains team it has become the latest incarnation of what
3624949 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
3624950 the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
3624951 sen mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors
3624952 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
3624953 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3624954 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
3624955 russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3624956 he was not calling for equivalence between russia and georgia he was calling for a ceasefire to stop the violence after russia invaded it was a totally different order of magnitude
3624957 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
3624958 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
3624959 part of the reason we dont have leverage is that we dont have a u s russian relationship it has been adrift
3624960 its easy to say something belligerent about russia im no friend of vladimir putin and cheap shots about tough talk are all well and fine but what are you doing to actually make the situation better
3624961 this type of bluster is fairly counterproductive because it is a bluff theres nothing we can do about this

3624972 the pattern of attacks three in a row during the games with security forces on high alert is an act of defiance that is unparalleled in recent xinjiang history
3624973 the global focus on china is an opportunity for people who believe their plight is ignored and invisible to take action
3624974 the concern here is that at a minimum this is going to add volatility to the region and polarize the uighur and chinese communities
3624975 there is also a fear the government will launch a widespread indiscriminate repressive campaign targeted far beyond the groups advocating use of violence
3624976 we can see that the attackers are merciless fugitives so the government should be on high alert
3624977 because they cannot carry out such attacks in their most desirable cities like beijing they have to turn to local locations

3624990 we are confident that every senator and the liberal opposition will want to look closely at the data from the tax office she told the national press club
3624991 that early data shows that there has been an overall reduction in consumption as a result of our measure and that is significant
3624992 other industry figures show a decrease of over a million litres of spirits combining the decrease in alcopops with the small increase in straight spirits a decline overall of 1 1 million litres of pure alcohol consumed
3624993 i would invite every senator and i certainly invite the liberal opposition to look where these figures are coming from and which figures are credible and for us to make an assessment on whether this measure in its very early days is already showing some success ms roxon said

3625015 but no matter how good you are at your sport a sport psychologist can make you even better
3625016 i did a lot of losing and got sick of it and was introduced to a psychologist
3625017 we started with visualising the perfect race right from the block
3625018 the next thing is how can i subdue the emotions of being in front of the crowd how can i subdue the thought that a billion people are watching
3625019 i went through a whole process of emotionalisation getting emotionally in tune with that idea of being number one
3625020 the first time i went there to the waiting room it was like a lamb to the slaughter i walked in there and thought i dont feel so good
3625021 the second time i walked in there i was feeling a whole bunch better
3625022 i bought out a book checked it was the right way round and sat in the corner reading

3625032 technology has changed so dramatically that we can change how we actually operate
3625033 a lot of what we were doing is if you will an old fashioned approach to newsgathering
3625034 what makes the difference is how were able to get out spread those journalists to more places and how quickly we can bring back original reporting to our viewers
3625035 i cant make it a perfect world because some people will flaunt the law
3625036 what were trying to do is respond to things that were finding and the thing were finding is people are getting creative so we need to be creative in finding solutions
3625037 were trying desperately to set up it systems that alert us to critical things like addresses phone numbers names that sound similar
3625038 weve been testing it we just havent got it fully implemented yet
3625039 and if this person de la torre was following safety regulations we would not have these people dead today its a travesty and we should allow for people like this to receive the full weight of the law
3625040 i think we need to give this individual a full opportunity to be heard but if hes guilty of what we suspect he needs to feel the weight of the penalty and anybody else who would even think about doing it they need to know were looking over their shoulder
3625041 these parents have undergone tremendous heartache yet they continue to fight tirelessly to improve bus safety standards in texas and across the country
3625042 whether its in the area of manufacturing licensing or law enforcement bus safety reform is an issue i will push the senate to review immediately and comprehensively
3625043 if that means someone has to go to jail then so be it

3625045 they were only in there a matter of minutes they knew exactly what they were looking for and had obviously cased the premises prior to the robbery
3625046 theyve had a set plan and they were in and out with the jewellery it was pretty dramatic for the staff obviously they were in fear
3625047 we are confident that every senator and the liberal opposition will want to look closely at the data from the tax office she told the national press club
3625048 that early data shows that there has been an overall reduction in consumption as a result of our measure and that is significant
3625049 other industry figures show a decrease of over a million litres of spirits combining the decrease in alcopops with the small increase in straight spirits a decline overall of 1 1 million litres of pure alcohol consumed

3625054 i thought it was wrong that senior police were parading the picture of him in the wig like a prized scalp
3625055 it was as if all the rules were thrown out in this case because he was a mokbel
3625056 authorise the council or its agents to make enquiries to corroborate this claim
3625057 permit the council or its agents to inspect the property on request
3625058 day by day under labour the rights and liberties of law abiding citizens are being undermined with more and more state officials trying to enter and spy on peoples homes
3625059 it may be appropriate for local authorities to check that council tax discounts are not wrongly claimed but it is wholly disproportionate to threaten higher council tax bills if residents do not allow state officials into their bedrooms

3625074 they are socially passive they live in the past and have no expectations or confidence for the future
3625075 the literacy rate of our women is very low they have no economic independence they have accepted poverty as an act of fate and their personalities have been suppressed they have no confidence they are afraid to think and they are in a state of laziness of thought they are inclined to believe in superstitions they are ineffective inside the family they have no knowledge of our central asian roots the properties of our matriarchal family structural have been erased from their minds their personalities are mostly cowardly or they dont care about others they are under sexual oppression their religious preferences are under the influence of men
3625076 i think they knew that history was being made tonight obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity
3625077 they did a good job of calling timeouts or substituting when there was a free throw usually on a free throw we get the ball and take off and run they did a good job of offensive rebounding too
3625078 we kind of settled down and we understood what we had to do we got steals we got stops and we scored on the other end
3625079 here youre talking about kobe and jason two elderly statesmen if you will leaders competitors they truly are the leaders of this team the younger players im talking about carmelo lebron wade all of them they defer to kobe and to jason as leaders
3625080 i took a couple of swings and on the first one i felt a little bit of a grab on my side then on the second swing i felt something a lot more significant i have never had this happen to me before its just frustrating for me
3625081 everyone knows how tough he is and hell play through things well get him checked out in the morning were not going to rush into anything because of who he is and how he plays but well get him checked out in the morning and try to get a medical update so we know how to proceed
3625082 i dont really see this as two totally different things theres too much of a coincidence it felt weird i tried to bend over and grab at it and hoped it would go away but its gotten progressively worse so its frustrating
3625083 you dont want one of your key players to be out but hopefully we have some guys that can step in and play ill slide over to play third and sean casey can play first so thats a pretty good infield there
3625084 he was on the dl earlier in the year and we had to play a little bit better were confident that we can play good ball but its definitely tough to lose a guy like mike lowell
3625085 when i read this essay i was thinking about my father and what he had to do in his early years in baseball
3625086 he actually had a face to face meeting with branch rickey who acted out what it would be like when he would break the color barrier he told him to hold back that natural reaction of fighting back physically because if you do it will end their experiment and would not move integration farther in baseball my father ended up agreeing because of the larger picture
3625087 it was really surprising i didnt think id win it i tried my hardest to write and gave it all my effort so it was really exciting
3625088 i felt honored and pleased and blessed that i got it
3625089 its a great experience for the girls most of them havent seen anything like this before and they get to see what rbi really is and what it stands for
3625090 it was a really great night its a great opportunity for all of pittsburgh and for all the teams here im just really proud of everyone and i hope we can do well
3625091 there were 33 processions today people were angry especially because of what happened yesterday there were four incidents of firing in srinagar city while forces opened fire at three other places we have exhibited maximum restraint two of our sub divisional police officers including a young ips officer an sho and 192 police and paramilitary force personnel were injured the protestors burnt three of our vehicles and damaged 33 other government vehicles
3625092 downward pressure on the philippine economy is mounting owing to slowing exports of electronics products and accelerating inflation
3625093 in 2009 we expect the pace of inflation to decelerate as rice price fuelled inflationary pressure is expected to ease thereafter the economy should recover gradually in 2009 driven by internal demand
3625094 as far as forex is concerned high crude oil prices continue to put the peso at risk of further depreciation if however crude oil prices trend down toward the end of 2008 in response to a slowing world economy then we see a possibility of the peso stabilizing
3625095 we think the downside impact in the peso should be partly offset by robust remittances from ofws overseas filipino workers and increased exports from the bpo business process outsourcing industry
3625096 we expect more than 20 percent growth in profits for 2008 and at least 20 percent growth in profits for 2009

3625111 no aparecer en la tapa de los diarios luego de ser descuartizada
3625112 hace cinco meses que decid separarme porque l intent asesinarme dos veces y nadie hace nada
3625113 el siempre fue violento pero desde hace dos a os comenz a amenazarme y a los chicos los hijos tienen entre dos y nueve a os les dice que me va a matar
3625114 el 25 de diciembre pasado me desfigur a golpes y luego me dijo que estaba arrepentido por no haberme matado directamente
3625115 all me dijeron que lo iban a notificar pero l sigue entrando y saliendo de la casa cuando quiere
3625116 tambi n ped custodia policial pero no me la dieron les pido una soluci n porque no quiero aparecer en la tapa de los diarios descuartizada

3625121 many judges if not most have been trial lawyers and they are suspicious that any expert is truly neutral
3625122 the virtue of our system is that it allows people to sort of balance things out
3625123 while it may be true that police can conduct surveillance of people on a public street without violating their rights tracking a person everywhere they go and keeping a computer record of it for days and days without that person knowing is a completely different type of intrusion
3625124 things that would have seemed fantastic 15 years ago are now routine
3625125 we have to rethink what is a reasonable expectation of privacy
3625126 im urging all our colleagues in the house to go back to their districts and make town hall consultations with their constituents so that by the time they get back after one week they would be able to give us a more accurate feedback from the ground not only based on their own personal idea but they have to speak as true representatives of the house of the people
3625127 so im now asking publicly all the congressmen in the house to go back to their districts and make the proper consultations on this very basic issue of cha cha charter change
3625128 we did our homework by organizing and starting to talk about charter change without yet talking specifically about anything in particular without yet talking about when we will have it and how we will have it thats how we started
3625129 kung may mangyari hanggang sa katapusan ng aming term e di mabuti po kung wala ring mangayri wala ding nawala if anything will happen up to the end of our term then thats good if nothing happens then its no loss what i mean is that we in the committee are ready to tackle things as they arrive
3625130 its timely as a matter of fact we should have done this many many years ago in so many congresses ago
3625131 in so far as the amendment of the constitution is concerned i personally believe that theres a need to amend the constitution
3625132 definitely most absolutely theres a need to amend the constitution the thing now is when do we amend i say if possible tomorrow
3625133 congress can amend the constitution not by the so called constituent assembly but by treating a resolution as provided for in our own rules just like any bill in other words a member of the house can file a resolution to amend the constitution and that resolution will pass through the same procedure as any bill
3625134 tama naman yan that is correct kung titingnan yung if we are going to look at the constitution congress by three fourths vote can propose amendments to the constitution ang issue lang naman diyan the only issue there is its not clear whether it should be a joint proposal or just need three fourths of all the members of congress

3625139 was viel verst render an dieser stadt ist ist nicht das was die beh rden getan haben sondern der umstand dass die b rger ihnen erlaubt haben es zu tun sie haben ihre b rgerlichen rechte gerne f r ein komfortables leben aufgegeben f r das gemeinwohl

3625144 whats the formula for determining how much an accident case is worth
3625145 i think it pitched in line and was hitting middle
3625146 yeah you are correct and the height seems to be okay
3625147 actually it pitched outside off and hit him in front of middle so there is an angle and there is a distance for the ball to cover so your basis for giving it out is wrong let me have a look

3625153 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
3625154 im not sure that obama will actually pursue the same kind of idea that we had inserted in the platform
3625155 i think we will have to pursue our congressional representatives to bring legislation forward
3625156 to say youre going to provide affordable coverage to people is not the same as giving them health care
3625157 just because you have insurance coverage does not guarantee you access to the care that you and your doctor decide you need and people with insurance understand that
3625158 ensuring that americans have access to affordable high quality health care
3625159 for 50 years the democratic party has been engaged in a battle to provide the kind of health care a great nation owes its people
3625160 we believe that health care is a right and not a privilege
3625161 and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon thee
3625162 weve been following oil and gas development in the amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes
3625163 when you look at where the oil and gas blocks are they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots almost as if by design and this is in one of the most if not the most biodiverse places on earth
3625164 the real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase because thats when the roads drilling and pipelines come in
3625165 theyre not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time
3625166 you could have each individual company thinking theyre being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you all of a sudden when you look at the bigger picture you have a sprawling road network
3625167 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3625168 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3625169 the j series continues to build on the fujifilm tradition of offering consumers feature rich easy to use compact cameras these new models give users greater choice versatility and stylish design at affordable prices for those who want a straightforward camera that takes great images but dont want to break the bank then fujifilms j range is the ideal choice
3625170 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3625171 lets explicitly own american in our programmes the speeches and the values he doesnt
3625172 the right knows obama is unelectable except perhaps against attila the hun
3625173 regardless of the sex of the candidates most americans in essence see the president as the father of the country they do not want someone who would be the first mama especially in this kind of world but there is a yearning for a kind of tough single parent
3625174 this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable
3625175 should not be surprised at the nationalism of kashmiris there has been a facade of normalcy in kashmir tourists coming and mobile phones arriving do not mean that people are not angry
3625176 wasted chances to come up with a creative solution with pakistan and kashmiris
3625177 i think the blockade made people realise that kashmir at the moment totally depends on india and that we need to be economically independent
3625178 the excessive and unwarranted use of force against the people of indian occupied kashmir
3625179 these statements constitute clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3625180 the first thing is the whole event is very undesirable in terms of both the domestic situation and its linkage with the larger bilateral peace process
3625181 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive

3625185 en cuanto a los propios principios la mayor parte de ellos son recomendaciones m s que obligaciones los estados no querr n estar en situaci n de negarse a cumplir las recomendaciones de la comunidad internacional
3625186 no se trata de estigmatizar a ciertos pa ses sino de tratar de asegurarse de que las pol ticas cambiarias sean adaptadas de tal manera que obtengamos un desarrollo m s armonioso de la econom a mundial un proceso de ajuste menos sujeto a crisis

3625192 nu papa dood is gaan jullie toch wel verder met zijn verhalen
3625193 juist de laatste twee jaar gaf hij aan dat hij vond dat hij het wel eens rustiger aan mocht doen
3625194 soms ben ik ook wel klaar met heul dat gedoe zei hij dan in zijn mooie brabants het boek is door een wreed toeval af het is voorbij door een granaat in georgi stan stierf in het harnas dag lieve stan ik zal je zo ontzettend missen
3625195 ongelooflijk zo vaak als hij is bedreigd met een kalasjnikov of een pistool op zijn hoofd hij wist welke risicos hij nam stan was geen cowboy al zijn ervaringen moesten worden weggeschreven
3625196 stan kwam bij ons werken in 1989 bij de start van rtl veronique het latere rtl4 hij heeft ons nooit verlaten geen dag dat was stan ik werkte voor het eerst uitgebreid met hem in za re om de revolutie tegen president mobutu te verslaan daar zag ik stan vier jaar jonger dan ik in vol ornaat grof gebekt gedreven ordinair professioneel met oog voor elk detail en boven alles betrouwbaar we hebben door de jaren heen de hele wereld over gereisd en alles meegemaakt onder de sterren geslapen in ethiopi en afghanistan goudenmedaillewinnaars ge nterviewd in salt lake city en aardbevingslachtoffers in marokko opgezocht
3625197 het was een bloednuchtere jongen ik herinner nog dat ik in bagdad zat te wachten op een cameraman stan was de enige die de juiste papieren had met zijn autootje volgepropt met al zijn spullen reed hij in zijn uppie dwars door de woestijn naar bagdad toen hij bij me aankwam grapte hij h conny wanneer gaat het nou eigenlijk eens beginnen hier stan was precies gearriveerd in die paar uur dat er niet geschoten werd in de stad hij was een nieuwsverslaafde cameraman maar beslist geen onbezonnen jongen
3625198 geen hoofdredacteur dwingt ons op pad te gaan we nemen ter plekke zelf de beslissing ik zit al 25 jaar in het vak en heb al ontelbare keren gedacht waar ben ik nou weer in beland we weten dat er risicos aan verbonden zijn en het zou me verbazen als hij daarover niet thuis sprak met zijn vrouw marjolein misschien zelfs met zijn kinderen
3625199 van marrakech tot belgrado van een item over speeltoestellen tot een liveverslag van een terreuraanslag op de kwaliteit van stan kan ik altijd rekenen
3625200 met stan storimans heb je als verslaggever goud in huis hartstochtelijk nieuwsdier en uitmuntend technicus die letterlijk op alle fronten ingezet kan worden
3625201 stan was niet alleen een zeer ervaren cameraman maar ook een uitermate geliefde collega we zullen alles in het werk stellen om stan en jeroen zo snel mogelijk terug naar nederland te halen uiteraard blazen we de najaarspresentatie af het zou zeer ongepast zijn om door te gaan
3625202 ik wil weten of er sprake is van een oorlogshandeling die tegen niemand in het bijzonder was gericht of dat er bewust is geschoten op de verslaggevers
3625203 ik werd vanochtend gebeld door pauline broekema het afschuwelijke nieuws trof me als een bliksemschicht toch hoort dit soort risicos bij dergelijke operaties ik vind het ook vreselijk voor jeroen akkermans wat die man allemaal heeft moeten meemaken hij is een van de beste tv verslaggevers die ik ken hij nam nooit onnodige risicos maar een mortieraanval hoor je niet aankomen een tankgranaat komt gierend op je af maar als je de explosie van een mortier hoort ben je te laat
3625204 no es la edad en s que cuando uno llega a los 80 ya est terminado

3625206 si la salud sexual se va al infierno podr a ser la punta del iceberg podr a ser una se al de problemas de salud

3625243 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face

3625281 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3625282 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3625283 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can

3625291 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3625292 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3625293 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3625294 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3625295 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3625296 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3625297 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3625298 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3625299 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3625300 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3625301 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3625302 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3625303 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3625304 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3625305 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3625306 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3625307 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3625308 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3625309 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3625310 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3625311 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3625312 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3625313 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3625314 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3625315 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3625316 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3625317 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3625318 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3625319 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3625320 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms

3625322 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3625323 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3625324 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3625325 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3625326 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3625327 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3625328 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3625329 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3625330 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3625331 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3625332 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3625333 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3625334 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3625335 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3625336 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3625337 i have at all times tried to fair and honest with the students the faculty the staff and the community

3625344 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3625345 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3625346 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3625347 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3625348 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3625349 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3625350 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3625351 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3625352 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3625353 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3625354 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3625355 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3625356 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3625357 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3625358 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3625359 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3625360 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3625361 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3625362 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3625363 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3625364 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3625365 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3625366 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon

3625369 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3625370 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3625371 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3625372 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3625373 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3625374 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3625375 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3625376 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3625377 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
3625378 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
3625379 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3625380 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
3625381 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3625382 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3625383 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3625384 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3625385 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3625386 just so you all know we did set a record
3625387 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3625388 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3625389 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3625390 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3625391 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3625392 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3625393 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3625394 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3625395 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3625396 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3625397 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted

3625410 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3625411 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3625412 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3625413 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short

3625423 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3625424 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3625425 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

3625430 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
3625431 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3625432 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3625433 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3625434 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3625435 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3625436 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3625437 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3625438 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3625439 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3625440 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3625441 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3625442 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3625443 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3625444 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3625445 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3625446 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3625447 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3625448 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3625449 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3625450 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3625451 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3625452 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3625453 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3625454 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3625455 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3625456 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3625457 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3625458 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3625459 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3625460 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3625461 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3625462 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3625463 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3625464 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3625465 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3625466 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3625467 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3625468 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3625469 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3625470 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3625471 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3625472 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3625473 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3625474 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3625475 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3625476 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3625477 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3625478 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3625479 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3625480 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3625481 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3625482 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3625483 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3625484 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3625485 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3625486 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3625487 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3625488 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3625489 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3625490 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3625491 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3625492 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3625493 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3625494 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3625495 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3625496 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3625497 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3625498 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3625499 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3625500 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3625501 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3625502 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3625503 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3625504 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3625505 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3625506 police in kingston have issued cctv images of a man they wish to trace in connection with a
3625507 thats great jim thats something else that despite everything you can still get on your bike and go 15 miles few patients even ride around the block
3625508 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3625509 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3625510 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3625511 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3625512 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3625513 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3625514 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3625515 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3625516 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3625517 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3625518 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3625519 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3625520 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3625521 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3625522 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3625523 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3625524 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3625525 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3625526 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3625527 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3625528 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3625529 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3625530 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3625531 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3625532 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3625533 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3625534 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3625535 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3625536 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3625537 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3625538 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3625539 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3625540 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3625541 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3625542 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3625543 now youve got the idea you keep putting these up and ill provide the wind deal
3625544 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3625545 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3625546 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3625547 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3625548 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3625549 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3625550 this is a very special memorial to a very special person
3625551 its silent on the effects the development of an airport would have on adjoining properties
3625552 when these people take off they will take off directly over my house
3625553 please give strong consideration to the development of rules and regulations whatever the proper term that will maintain the safety of me and of my neighbors
3625554 its more to extend a conditional use process for aviation uses that cross the line into commercial
3625555 i think its going to help the city grow in that direction it gives a vision of continuity for the city
3625556 i am pleasantly surprised that there was this much support in the end in the beginning there was not much of an outreach
3625557 it looks like a pretty fair contract hopefully everyone elses goes as well
3625558 i think generally were pleased overall our students are performing better
3625559 remember that a school must score proficient in all areas the actual student achievement may rise and a school still not make ayp
3625560 a lot of people said were testing too much but we have to know where the tests results are at so we can give them what they need
3625561 in blessed memory of richard allen julis raphael avraham ben moshe
3625562 where do you get the time to talk to 100 people about their vacations
3625563 do you have any idea how much the same meal would cost back in the states
3625564 wed rather experience a nuclear meltdown than put up with your deranged family
3625565 why the hell would you not run the bass channel when running it sounds so much better
3625566 because its so loud as it is i cant mix it
3625567 youre insane you just mixed it and it sounded great
3625568 modern writers injure the smoothness of our tongue by omitting vowels wherever it is possible and joining the harshest consonants together with only an apostrophe between thus for judged in it self not the smoothest of words they say
3625569 poor old ben he ought to be very grateful that he is not alive to see what writers have done to the smoothness of our tongue today
3625570 this isnt just a cookbook its a way of life
3625571 what if theyd bombed the railroad lines to the camps
3625572 youll notice that our book is published by ben yehuda press he only invented modern hebrew that son of a jew so i guess ill see you at your jewish book fair right
3625573 my 94 year old writing partner couldnt be here tonight because he has a standup gig playing the cedars sinai hospital
3625574 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3625575 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3625576 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3625577 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3625578 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3625579 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3625580 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3625581 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3625582 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3625583 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3625584 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3625585 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3625586 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3625587 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3625588 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3625589 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3625590 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3625591 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3625592 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3625593 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3625594 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3625595 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3625596 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3625597 weve told dontrelle the same thing my goal with him and our goal with him has been that wed like him to be ready to be the big league pitcher that hes capable of being in 2009
3625598 if its before that thats great so lets see what happens
3625599 he threw strikes the last time out and the previous few times out hes averaged around 90 mph hes topped out higher than that his arm strength is there his breaking balls been solid well just wait and well take it turn by turn
3625600 hes worked very hard in all aspects conditioning and delivery wise
3625601 hes been great with the kids down there the other thing thats happened with him is that he really has had a great sense of focus when hes gotten on the mound which hes worked on much more serious out there for him just little things that instructors have tried to make adjustments with him that so far hes taken to them
3625602 hes obviously thrown pretty well but i think this next step is critical because reporters will be down in toledo watching him to their credit im sure therell be some cameras down there from detroit its another step we have to just wait and see how its handled
3625603 its another step in the right direction and well have to see how this step goes from what im hearing hes made some real good strides obviously thats true or they wouldnt be sending him to triple a
3625604 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3625605 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3625606 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3625607 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3625608 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3625609 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3625610 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3625611 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3625612 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3625613 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3625614 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3625615 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3625616 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3625617 the demand for green collar jobs is really exploding especially as the cost of energy continues to climb
3625618 students need to start thinking about developing skills that will give them an edge for these types of careers that did not even exist until recently
3625619 in the next 10 years we will put a man on the moon
3625620 in the end we are all human beings and we have to work collectively for the sake of humanity
3625621 strawberry pop tart in a toaster for five minutes and 50 seconds it will turn into a snack pastry blowtorch shooting flames up to 30 inches high
3625622 estoy dejando al secretario general la prefectura para que contin e esta labor mientras yo haga las acciones legales pertinentes
3625623 ahora el gobierno sabr lo que hace pero de ninguna manera que se distorsione diciendo que el prefecto de cochabamba se agarra del cargo lo nico que hace es defender en la justicia lo que corresponde
3625624 to win the money all you have to do is fit an hho system to a late model car already in good condition and tune so that a consistent 25 or greater improvement in fuel economy is obtained and maintained for six months without causing any damage to the engine
3625625 i dont think it is going to happen even if they say yes now i dont think we have enough time to prepare for the series and complete the logistical details for the series
3625626 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3625627 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3625628 wealth has never yet sacrificed itself on the altar of patriotism
3625629 there were so many boat operators and boat owners on the lake at the time it was becoming dangerous
3625630 were not out here actually looking for problems mainly were just trying to get people a permit if they dont have one
3625631 were not looking at penalizing anybody for not having a permit were looking at bringing people into compliance

3625672 in the absence of independent monetary and exchange rate policies directors underlined the importance of continuing to pursue sound fiscal policies increasing the flexibility of the economy bolstering productivity growth and monitoring developments in the financial sector closely
3625673 in particular directors viewed the increase in retail electricity tariffs as instrumental in limiting expenditure overruns and encouraged the authorities to follow through with further steps toward full cost recovery while supporting efforts to protect low income households the announced elimination of certain subsidies notably those to public shipyards in 2009 are also important steps in putting the public finances on a sound footing
3625674 at the same time directors noted that the banks still high level of non performing loans relatively thin provisioning and concentrated exposures in the cooling housing sector called for increased supervisory vigilance aimed inter alia at augmenting provisioning buffers

3625683 the main objective of this program is not just to prevent tooth decay not only to inculcate the value of ensuring good health to all children
3625684 but this is part of our general and overall efforts to improve participation rate of our school children in the elementary and high school levels
3625685 that is why the government is giving premium and helping on our health programs
3625686 but we are trying our very best to give the utmost service to all schools
3625687 we should be very thankful to the governor for being very sensitive and responsive to our need

3625691 our results show that the protective effect of time spent outdoors persists even if a child is doing a lot of near work such as reading and studying
3625692 promoting outdoor activity to parents and families and including more outdoor pursuits in school curricula could be an important public health measure to avoid the development of myopia
3625693 this public health message would be particularly relevant in those countries where the rates of myopia in children are very high such as in singapore and taiwan

3625696 it was a competitive session today and we need to bring that on the weekend
3625697 thats whats been missing at the start of the last few games and were super keen to turn that round
3625698 murph has got a little bit of venom in him so when you wind him up the wrong way he can get a bit nasty
3625699 probably the last three weeks weve been trying to pick up our defensive side of things physicality and that sort of stuff
3625700 on the weekend the first 25 minutes of the game was just not acceptable
3625701 it took us halfway through the second quarter to realise that which was the disappointing part
3625702 weve got to continue working on it weve still got some light frame bodies but weve really addressed that hardness issue and that was the most disappointing part on the weekend
3625703 were not playing bad full games were probably putting together a quarter thats really hurting us at the moment
3625704 we see ourselves as a mentally strong group but we let ourselves down in that area against north
3625705 were not a good enough side to flirt with our form he said
3625706 we were out to win the kangaroos game and that was disappointing we didnt and now weve got to beat brisbane who are fighting for their life as well
3625707 if we go into the finals losing three or four in a row its so hard you just cant switch on the light
3625708 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3625709 from now on its just a downward slope the end is close i love it
3625710 we were not actually playing against the georgian team we were playing against our brazilian friends here
3625711 i feel like a georgian i have a georgian passport and a brazilian passport
3625712 i think the afl is probably on the right path there it is dangerous now to just let people come on the ground so i think theyll just look after the players welfare
3625713 whats the risk you just dont know when there are a lot of people and youve just got to be careful dont you
3625714 you wouldnt want any spectators to get injured let alone any of the players when people are in a mad rush
3625715 they might even have security now at the myer stocktake sale to make sure that no one gets an injury going up the stairs its something very similar
3625716 if its meant to be itll happen if its meant to be for brendan and he kicks a hundred well then thats fantastic
3625717 but if not we just worry about winning the four points as a group
3625718 if we can keep winning we might give ourselves another week to give him a chance but at the moment its just about what the team can do not what he can do
3625719 we wont be going out of our way running into open goals and kicking the ball at right angles to fevola when the goal should be kicked
3625720 we think our confidence is growing and were playing fairly good football over the last month without winning all the games
3625721 this gives us a reflection on exactly where were at
3625722 well walk away from this game saying we have really improved or we have got a lot of work to do individually and collectively

3625731 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3625732 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3625733 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3625734 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3625735 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3625736 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3625737 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3625738 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3625739 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3625740 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3625741 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3625742 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3625748 the roads in central delhi were spilling over with protesters who blocked all the paths leaving us commuters with no choice but to either wait for them to clear off or take alternative routes i opted for the latter and still ended up in a traffic jam which did not clear for a good half an hour
3625749 there were no vehicles near the new delhi railway station and in parts of connaught place it was like an ocean of people on the roads all protesting and not one vehicle in sight commuters had a harrowing time i twice ferried commuters who were strangers but chose to travel together since they had the same destination and there was no transport available
3625750 i didnt know about the nationwide protest today after getting off the metro in connaught place i couldnt understand why there were hardly any autos on the road and then it started raining after waiting for nearly 45 minutes i found an auto driver who agreed to take me to my workplace in south extension but charged me double the fare
3625751 we know that families in some communities still use the corner shop on a daily basis for their food and other household goods
3625752 it is therefore essential we take healthy eating options to these stores and reach those families who are at the greatest risk of poor health due to a poor diet
3625753 working together we can bring not only the access but also the messages about healthy choices to the consumers that need it most
3625754 we fully support the drive to encourage healthy eating through improving access to fruit and veg
3625755 but just providing healthy food options isnt enough to change the way people eat to be successful this initiative needs to be joined up with other local programmes which can educate and empower people to make healthy choices
3625756 obesity is a complex problem it will take long term sustained investment to change the habits of the next generation
3625757 we are satisfied with our profitability performance in the second quarter and the industry division reported good overall results however we expect future market conditions to remain challenging

3625770 over 1 000 civilians have been killed as the result of an attack by georgia on the capital of its breakaway republic of south ossetia the north ossetian nationalities minister said friday according to the south ossetian information and press committee the number of fatalities is estimated according to preliminary information at over 1 000

3625779 i have to do the cheesecake or some variation of it
3625780 its one of those things that people come for that you always have to have
3625781 i want everything on the menu to be a signature dish i have to believe it is all of that quality
3625782 but there are certain things the customers expect you can suggest the specials maybe the lobster ravioli or the lamb chops i love them all but they come back to the ossobuco al bosco
3625783 even if you dont intend for it to be your signature it can turn out that way if the customers love it and expect it from you
3625784 i wanted to do something a little different and the small plate concept really appealed to me
3625785 i think people have gotten away from the big entree i noticed so many people ordering off the appetizer menu i decided to focus on a selection of small entrees people could share
3625786 nothing fancy just five ingredients but its the one thing always in my repertoire even my mom has to have it and i would make anything on the menu for her
3625787 over the top is how i would describe its popularity
3625788 you can only get it on monday for a reason it develops a following it brings people in who might not otherwise check us out and my hope is that their eye goes to other parts of the menu and they see something else they want to try its a no brainer if its good they will come
3625789 it is a good thing and bad thing to be known for something
3625790 but we prided ourselves on being as organic as possible and serving things that were as fresh as possible and natural the jar was a way to showcase what we were doing once it caught on i had to have it
3625791 and probably some cheesecake in fact i may just have the cheesecake
3625792 i may change it a little but it still has to taste the same
3625793 i would say 80 percent are pleasantly surprised how much they like the sardines when prepared well
3625794 bottomfeeder how to eat ethically in a world of vanishing seafood
3625795 we used to wait until 2 a m when the fishing boats would come in the sardines would be grilled right then on the beach with a bit of sea salt we would eat them on top of bread with olive oil and a glass of wine
3625796 customers who like a stronger fish really like the sardines

3625803 i think that all senators and i include in that the liberal opposition as well as all minor parties will be looking closely at the data that abounds in this debate
3625804 i must say if they are looking closely at it they will see that it is a fairly consistent line of behaviour happening here which is fairly biased release of material from the industry

3625812 atl tico hat eine gute mannschaft und wir m ssen versuchen uns im heimspiel eine gute ausgangsposition zu verschaffen
3625813 wir waren alle der meinung dass wir noch jemanden in unserem trainerteam brauchen
3625814 er kann einen frischen wind reinbringen und hat eine andere sicht der dinge da er eine lange und erfolgreiche karriere als spieler hinter sich hat
3625815 beim spiel gegen liverpool geht es nicht um details sondern um gro e unterschiede sie m ssen schon weit unter ihrem normalen niveau spielen w hrend wir ber uns hinauswachsen m ssen alles muss uns in die karten spielen
3625816 wie wir gegen anderlecht gespielt haben reicht nicht gegen liverpool
3625817 wir haben uns hinten naiv angestellt das k nnen wir uns gegen einen solchen gegner nicht leisten
3625818 wir werden versuchen m glichst zu gewinnen weil f r uns ein sieg ein gutes ergebnis w re aber wenn das nicht geht dann sollten wir zumindest ein ausw rtstor erzielen wir haben uns videos von standard angesehen und berichte ber sie gelesen aber es ist fr h in der saison und man wei da nie so recht wie sie spielen werden vor allem weil sie einen spieler haben der f r dieses spiel von olympia zur ckgekommen ist

3625868 you change one thing and it all changes i wrote back stories for each character even if one character like rafferty wasnt on the island i wanted to know what he was doing at that time it became a bit of a puzzle
3625869 i had training in story structure but my dialog is stronger for me than description a lot happens in dialog the locations are very visual though new england is such a visual place
3625870 its a heros journey of a woman using joseph campbells structure the overriding structure is his structure theres the receiving of the call and towner literally gets a call the refusal of the call all of that theres the world of the story this surreal world delights and there are awful things shes a reluctant heroine and at the end of the heros journey the hero goes back to teach towner does that here
3625871 the duality is this person mentally ill or are they such survivor that they create another reality its a spiritual journey
3625872 ten people were killed and 24 were injured in the bombing
3625873 it was a competitive session today and we need to bring that on the weekend
3625874 thats whats been missing at the start of the last few games and were super keen to turn that round
3625875 murph has got a little bit of venom in him so when you wind him up the wrong way he can get a bit nasty
3625876 probably the last three weeks weve been trying to pick up our defensive side of things physicality and that sort of stuff
3625877 on the weekend the first 25 minutes of the game was just not acceptable
3625878 it took us halfway through the second quarter to realise that which was the disappointing part
3625879 weve got to continue working on it weve still got some light frame bodies but weve really addressed that hardness issue and that was the most disappointing part on the weekend
3625880 were not playing bad full games were probably putting together a quarter thats really hurting us at the moment
3625881 we see ourselves as a mentally strong group but we let ourselves down in that area against north
3625882 were not a good enough side to flirt with our form he said
3625883 we were out to win the kangaroos game and that was disappointing we didnt and now weve got to beat brisbane who are fighting for their life as well
3625884 if we go into the finals losing three or four in a row its so hard you just cant switch on the light
3625885 however our study shows that the crucial feature is being outdoors irrespective of the activity you are doing
3625886 our results show that the protective effect of time spent outdoors persists even if a child is doing a lot of near work such as reading and studying
3625887 promoting outdoor activity to parents and families and including more outdoor pursuits in school curricula could be an important public health measure to avoid the development of myopia
3625888 i think the afl is probably on the right path there it is dangerous now to just let people come on the ground so i think theyll just look after the players welfare
3625889 whats the risk you just dont know when there are a lot of people and youve just got to be careful dont you
3625890 you wouldnt want any spectators to get injured let alone any of the players when people are in a mad rush
3625891 they might even have security now at the myer stocktake sale to make sure that no one gets an injury going up the stairs its something very similar
3625892 if its meant to be itll happen if its meant to be for brendan and he kicks a hundred well then thats fantastic
3625893 but if not we just worry about winning the four points as a group
3625894 if we can keep winning we might give ourselves another week to give him a chance but at the moment its just about what the team can do not what he can do
3625895 we wont be going out of our way running into open goals and kicking the ball at right angles to fevola when the goal should be kicked
3625896 we think our confidence is growing and were playing fairly good football over the last month without winning all the games
3625897 this gives us a reflection on exactly where were at
3625898 nous avons trait tous les points sur lesquels le pr sident mugabe et le chef des dissidents arthur mutambara sont daccord mais il y a d saccord sur un l ment pour lequel morgan tsvangirai a demand un temps de r flexion

3625929 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3625930 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3625931 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3625932 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3625933 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3625934 to instruct forces to urgently overcome the consequences helping people stabilize life and keep updating damages
3625935 owing to the belief that there was a potential threat to life the firearms support unit was called to assist with the control of the incident

3625953 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3625954 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3625955 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3625956 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3625957 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3625969 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3625970 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3625971 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3625972 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3625973 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3625976 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3625977 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3625978 the last couple of times weve played geelong weve been in the hunt at different times in the game its just about being a bit more consistent

3626114 lihat mereka sangat briliant smart dan dengan penuh dedikasi membela engkau dari berbagai serangan luar sana
3626115 yang harus kalian lakukan adalah menyuarakan dan mewartakan kebenaran itu
3626116 bila engkau membela kebenaran itu dengan cara demikian maka susungguhnya engkau hanyalah membela dirimu sendiri
3626117 moe bila apa yang kamu sampaikan tidak diterima mereka kamu jangan kecewa

3626120 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
3626121 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means

3626126 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
3626127 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
3626128 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
3626129 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality

3626135 we are confident that every senator and the liberal opposition will want to look closely at the data from the tax office she told the national press club
3626136 that early data shows that there has been an overall reduction in consumption as a result of our measure and that is significant
3626137 other industry figures show a decrease of over a million litres of spirits combining the decrease in alcopops with the small increase in straight spirits a decline overall of 1 1 million litres of pure alcohol consumed
3626138 i would invite every senator and i certainly invite the liberal opposition to look where these figures are coming from and which figures are credible and for us to make an assessment on whether this measure in its very early days is already showing some success ms roxon said

3626147 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
3626148 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
3626149 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
3626150 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

3626175 some people take a little longer maturity wise hes driving the same pitches that he fouled off last year he looked like he waited a long time just to see if the pitch was a strike now hes confident enough to know he can
3626176 these kids just have to learn youve got to be a strike thrower to pitch in the big leagues

3626180 they were only in there a matter of minutes they knew exactly what they were looking for and had obviously cased the premises prior to the robbery
3626181 konkret hur t nker sig riksbanken att kade r ntekostnader f r hush llen kan s nka kraven p l ne kningar i en tid n r arbetstagarna f tt se sin reala k pkraft urholkas av kraftiga pris kningar p viktiga produktgrupper som energi och livsmedel tv rtom kar risken f r kompensationskrav i kommande l nef rhandlingar vilket i sin tur verkligen skulle leda till inflation
3626182 det r bara under vissa omst ndigheter som v ra m tt p inflation sammanfaller med den faktiska inflationen
3626183 mit einer nicht unbedeutenden ausnahme ich muss herziges schreiben doch gerade w rde ich das erste mal in meinem leben lieber die energiepolitik der bundesregierung beleuchten als die nicht minder katastrophalen wirrnisse zwischen den geschlechtern

3626185 hausarbeit ist etwas was man ungl cklicherweise erledigen muss aber dann sollte man bitte nicht auch noch dar ber sprechen
3626186 und sommerschlussverkauf sorry findet leider ohne mich statt solange ich noch restvernunft gepaart mit einem stolzen saldo vorweisen kann streit mit den nachbarn in meinem haus wohnen nur sexy biester oder freundliche schl mpfe da sind keine dramen blo wohlgefallen und sich ber beh rden zu echauffieren geht es denn noch klischeehafter
3626187 du sollst mir helfen und mich nicht demotivieren das sind doch alles keine themen
3626188 mal was ganz anderes was ist mit dem wasserfleck in eurem treppenhaus waren die klempner da
3626189 das ist allerdings eine am sante geschichte zwei b rtige und stolz bebauchte mittvierziger standen vorgestern um neun uhr morgens vor meiner t r ich warf mich in windeseile in ein kleid ffnete und versuchte wach und zurechnungsf hig zu wirken
3626190 nun ja die handwerker benahmen sich die erste viertelstunde u erst merkw rdig sie wollten berhaupt nicht arbeiten strichen um mich rum wie faule tierchen tranken begeistert leitungswasser und sagten auf meine frage ob ich ihnen schokolade anbieten k nne was anderes hatte ich nicht da nee danke an s em fehlts uns nicht
3626191 als ich dann hoch gekn pft zur ck stolzierte schauten sich die klempnerherren nur entt uscht an

3626195 wir brauchen eine gesamtdeutsche regionalpolitik die fast 20 jahre nach dem mauerfall die ost oder westdeutsche brille abnimmt
3626196 wir m ssen vermeiden dass sich dort genau die disparit ten entwickeln die wir heute im osten haben
3626197 es ist unstrittig dass die zuk nftige f rderung sich an wirtschaftlichen notwendigkeiten von regionen und nicht mehr nach himmelsrichtungen orientieren wird

3626199 lufthansa is increasing its services to and from brazil in cooperation with tam
3626200 the codeshare agreement with our partner tam will provide our passengers with seamless connections to further domestic destinations via frankfurt and s o paulo our passengers will be able to reach these airports conveniently with only one check in at the start of their journey
3626201 linking lufthansa and tams schedules will increase the benefits for our customers moreover we are stimulating growth in air traffic between germany and brazil
3626202 its strange when it happens but obviously you have to find a way to win the game
3626203 it didnt go foul so we have to battle and preserve the tie game
3626204 delmon hitting the big three run homer that was pretty doggone exciting
3626205 its just unfortunate that we couldnt come up with another run after that
3626206 we hit into five double plays mo gives up three runs
3626207 you see things youve never seen before when youre going through struggles like we are right now and you really come to expect the unexpected you just have to battle back
3626208 i calmed down once i heard what they had to say
3626209 once jerry blevins got me out of that jam i knew we were going to win
3626210 in my last inning i felt everything was working well
3626211 id like to get a little more comfortable in the first couple of innings i get behind in the count try to get a strike and let up just a little bit and give up a home run
3626212 we didnt hit the cover off the ball but we got what we needed
3626213 gio has been awesome ever since he settled down after the first inning in toronto
3626214 thats a key difference between top notch pitchers and average pitchers
3626215 we tried to do one thing with the bat and we didnt read it right we got outpitched and they made good plays
3626216 the starters success will let you play a long time
3626217 keep playing well now and then get an opportunity to play into the late fall
3626218 any time your starters are pitching that well and getting outs quickly you have more time to hit
3626219 if they hit those balls in milwaukee theyre not coming back
3626220 there were some plays where the ballpark helped me cam did a great job out there running the ball down but im not pitching to the ballpark
3626221 he made his pitches but it was a tough game for us
3626222 we hit a lot of balls well that were outs he had luck on his side
3626223 that thing looked like it was shot out of a cannon
3626224 those are fun home runs to watch because it was smoked
3626225 theyre showing up offensively theyre more relaxed it looks like theyre having a lot of fun and enjoying themselves things tend to go your way when that happens
3626226 i think its all due to my legs my strength is back ive been taking care of my knee doing my exercises and getting the treatment that i need its taken a long time but im glad its to the point where i feel very strong with my back leg
3626227 i threw him some good changeups the first at bat he must have been looking for that changeup
3626228 everything was working tonight i just had that one bad inning and one bad pitch really
3626229 after you go through them two or three times theres a chance theyre going to get you
3626230 girls are not supposed to be actively seeking something a girl simply exists for someone to marry or divorce her
3626231 people who go for a picnic need to know each other a little longer than that let alone make a lifelong commitment
3626232 ive never gotten caught up in stuff like this because i figure the time to do this is when im not doing this anymore
3626233 but the thing that impresses me aside from the overall number of wins is that when you start getting mentioned in the same breath as mccarthy casey stengel ralph houk miller huggins and guys like that then it becomes something that gets your attention joe mccarthy has a pretty good track record so this win certainly will be a memorable one for more reasons than one
3626234 its satisfying from the standpoint that weve got the right components to go far this season and keep going
3626235 guys like manny have that experience and have been in situations in tough games
3626236 i cant sit back and complain and say i should be in there but when they ask you to do something whether it be start that day or come off the bench and play defense or get a key hit its a good feeling
3626237 the last few weeks this ballclub has really been playing hard
3626238 and then the addition of manny has certainly picked up the personality of this club we feel this is an important week for us
3626239 mannys very smart hes intelligent especially when it comes to hitting a baseball and he goes to school on the pitchers too he knows exactly what theyve got and how theyre going to pitch him
3626240 in flauberts novels stupidity is an inseparable dimension of human existence

3626243 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3626244 book a guy on a bike running the red light day
3626245 i wake up in the morning and the entire place is
3626246 we all decided we were sick of it down there
3626247 it seemed like a pretty cool happening spot we wanted to try it out you can get away with anything too thats the other cool thing youre kind of free to do whatever you want and nobody is going to fuck with you too much its kinda like one of the last free places where you can be a shithead and get away with it
3626248 nothing in fact and as a matter of fact is personalized unless the heart is full of true longing and love
3626249 it gives those agencies carte blanche to do what they want
3626250 its not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3626251 its ridiculous to admit that something is endangered because of climate change and then say the law doesnt apply to climate change
3626252 the bush administration is trying to do by regulation what they cant do by legislation
3626253 out of a responsibility and respect for the victims of the holocaust
3626254 we have to prepare our contemporaries for the release of mein kampf
3626255 we have to supply them with objective arguments and give them the ability to hold their own in the political and publicity debate
3626256 an aggressive and enlightened way of dealing with the book would undoubtedly divest it of much of the myth that so unjustly surrounds it
3626257 fail to add to our understanding of such things as the holocaust or the elation with which many people followed the nazi rule it wouldnt even reach those supposedly benefiting from it the man in the street
3626258 your average joe just isnt interested in such a publication
3626259 at least i havent met anybody yet in the subway or wherever who has begged for one
3626260 the text is easily available abroad and on the internet
3626261 nobody can prevent people from quoting it or using it for illegal purposes and an edition like the one some people now call for wont change that
3626262 which is the object is not exists at that page goh6613
3626263 as the cost of living is on the up these figures even if they are only part reflective of pensioners as a whole are of real concern
3626264 retirement should be a time to enjoy yourself after all those years of hard work
3626265 the cost of living for the elderly has surpassed inflation over the past decade therefore it is more important than ever that consumers are aware of the dangers of approaching retirement with such large amounts of debt
3626266 for many pensioners today these figures show its a case of bought then worrying about it now
3626267 with the costs of living increasing dramatically particularly as winter approaches and fuel costs mount up it is vital that those struggling are given the help they need to ensure that people arent trapped by debt
3626268 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
3626269 the only result of the use of air strikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism if the international community focuses on the terrorists bases hideouts and places where they are being trained and financed the problem is going to solved
3626270 i cannot foresee a winning outcome in afghanistan without resolving the sanctuaries in the tribal areas of pakistan
3626271 i cant see a viable level of afghan government authority developing here while there are still all these militant sanctuaries across the border

3626276 the company does continue to experience strong demand for its retirement living and aged care accommodation and has 70 new units due for completion between now and december 2008
3626277 these new units which are supported by strong pre sales are expected to underpin earnings and cash flows in the current financial year
3626278 demand across the portfolio remains firm with over 22 million in reservations and pre sales presently in place
3626279 this provides us with a firm footing to commence the new financial year
3626280 across our portfolio of 21 villages we presently have 15 villages operating above our long term occupancy rate of 95 per cent including four operating at 100 per cent capacity
3626281 lack of available stock remains an issue at some villages
3626282 we will be looking at practises not just within other regional areas but also in areas where we have existing practices as well as looking for expansion opportunities interstate

3626285 we have totally reclaimed the villages occupied by rebels but troops are still clearing the areas of landmines left behind by the milf forces
3626286 they want to attend to their farms and return to their normal life but landmines and unexploded munitions are posing a danger to civilians
3626287 troops are carefully clearing the areas slowly and inch by inch to really ensure that no explosives are left behind
3626288 we have complied with the agreement between the cease fire committees to reposition our forces to avoid further clashes had not militias attacked the milf there would have been no hostilities in north cotabato

3626314 we were very pleased with the speed and ease in setting up ericoms powerterm webconnect in a terminal services environment
3626315 maintaining the windows based ts environment with ericom running on top is far less complex than maintaining a citrix environment for a global operation of our size the learning curve involved in gaining the required specialized know how on citrixs systems is longer than we can afford while also maintaining applications ericoms powerterm webconnect remoteview also provides us with cost savings while enhancing and streamlining the end user experience
3626316 by implementing ericoms presentation virtualization and desktop virtualization solution organizations gain the financial and operational flexibility of choosing how to manage their resources and tco
3626317 as amazone chooses to migrate their power users to virtual desktops both windows terminal services and vdi environments will be managed from a single console making it staffs life that much easier

3626324 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3626325 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3626326 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3626327 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3626328 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3626329 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3626330 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3626331 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3626332 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3626361 it think what really stuck out to me was the significance of what went on in sunnyvale that many of us didnt even know about
3626362 onizuka was important for the safety and history of our country and the space program
3626363 you have lockheed moffet and onizuka all near there which really are defining parts of sunnyvale
3626364 determining whether or not was the mission control for the corona project is essential to determining its significance and eligibility the corona project is a significant piece of cold war history despite the fact that the cold war events are quire recent they are monumental in the scheme of american history
3626365 if government employees can keep administrative costs down and you think thats such a good thing then why not let medicare compete with insurance companies if medicare is so good why do you need to make it crime for people not to fund it or if you view medicare as a type of charitable organization why not let it compete with other non profits

3626368 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3626369 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3626370 we want to ahem raise issues and get presidential candidates talking about it
3626371 there will be a press line to take photos as they are going in
3626372 i just got back from a two week vacation in russia
3626373 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3626374 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3626375 i was released from prison five months ago ive just been laying low ive been in the studio recording and s t i got deported and all that
3626376 im definitely coming back to the united states but for the time being im down here getting my mind right and my situation right i think itll be better for me down here than in new york cause theres a lot of sh t going on and i wouldve been involved in all of that

3626394 over the years conservatives have invested considerable capital and enjoyed considerable success in making old europe a veritable synonym for all that is effete and snobbish and chablis drinking and just plain alien about liberalism europe was a bit of symbolism they thought they had tarnished beyond redemption a well they had poisoned for good remember freedom fries or how john kerry was supposed to look french or how misguided europeans were supposed to be with their national health plans and their failure to tremble before the almighty
3626395 and this is why people remember movies and music better than school
3626396 and this is why the people who deliver their messages via multimedia become stars
3626397 der parlamentarische fahrplan zur erh hung der familienbeihilfe ab 1 11 2008 und aktuelle politische fragen
3626398 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3626399 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3626400 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3626401 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
3626402 the police have reports of a large monkey riding on top of a speeding ambulance what has happened
3626403 the talks have not collapsed its just a time out
3626404 these sterling achievements have overcome numerous concerted efforts from some sections of the international community to destabilise our peace and stability and thus cause confusion in our country
3626405 se non mi ridate il cavallo faccio quello che ha fatto mio nonno
3626406 these technologies are cool but arent core to your business
3626407 hope is hearing the melody of the future faith is to dance to it now
3626408 it all depends on whether or not the fragment of our life reveals the plan and the material of the whole there are fragments which are only good to be thrown away and others which are important for centuries to come because their fulfillment can only be a divine work they are fragments of necessity if our life however remotely reflects such a fragment we shall not have to bewail our fragmentary life but on the contrary rejoice in it
3626409 in gods economy whether he is making a flower or a human soul nothing ever comes to nothing the losses are his way of accomplishing the gains
3626410 when suffering shatters the carefully kept vase that is our lives god stoops to pick up the pieces but he doesnt put them back together as a restoration project patterned after our former selves instead he sifts through the rubble and selects some of the shards as raw material for another project a mosaic that tells the story of redemption
3626411 gratitude unlocks the fullness of life it turns what we have into enough and more it turns denial into acceptance chaos to order confusion to clarity it can turn a meal into a feast a house into a home a stranger to a friend gratitude makes sense of our past brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow
3626412 keane and torres are clever players they scored plenty of goals last season and when they have played a lot more games together for us they will score here too
3626413 these two strikers are top class and they can be at the level of anyone in this competition they will get better and better
3626414 they will need time it has been a difficult summer with players arriving for training at different stages but i have no worries about them in the future
3626415 liege are in good form they beat anderlecht last weekend in the belgian super cup and last season in their league they barely lost a game and went over 30 without defeat at one stage
3626416 they did not concede many goals they have a strong defence and a quick attack we must concentrate
3626417 i am not thinking about signing players at the moment because they cannot play against liege i am only concentrating on this game
3626418 and i have not needed to contact the owners because they cannot help with the preperation for this match i prefer not to say anything else
3626419 i was really calm last week and i am concentrating on the game we did not have big problems
3626420 i have not been distracted i have been focusing on this game and getting to the champions league group stages
3626421 i always have confidence in my players but when you play against anyone in europe you have to be very careful we know standard are a good team especially at home
3626422 he had a scratched up badge attached to him and he real quickly showed me the badge but you couldnt see anything
3626423 he had a piece of paper that said i had a 256k modem and how he had that information i dont know
3626424 well at first he wanted to go in the house
3626425 it seemed like he really wanted to get our signatures
3626426 i said if i want this deal im just going to call qwest and get it myself thats what i said to him and he said oh cant do that he just acted like sign up now or thats it
3626427 obviously if hes working our neighborhood hes working other neighborhoods
3626428 greece does not have the power to keep the peace at the aegean
3626429 peace in asian minor and safety in asia will maintain only with the return of these islands to turkey
3626430 turkey defined our territorial waters within 6 miles from the mainland in 1930 thus chios lesvos and samos are located within the territorial waters of turkey the right of sovereignty of a country in its own territorial waters allows it to practice the same rights for the islands that are within these waters
3626431 none of the military regimes that had come into our political system ever understood the underlining forces of democracy and good governance
3626432 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3626433 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3626434 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3626435 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3626436 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3626437 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
3626438 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
3626439 the air force granted me leave to play in the cfl and now theyve deemed that my skills and expertise is at a high need
3626440 im a missile combat crew commander so basically i will be controlling the maintenance and security dealing with the nuclear missiles we have at our base
3626441 when he came into camp he showed some great skills and learned how to pass block which i was really excited about
3626442 as old as i am and being from the states weve been through a few wars since i started growing up in the 60s so yeah theres a huge trepidation
3626443 its part of the cost of being able to live here and talk about football and stuff like that all you have to do is watch the olympics to figure out the rest of the world doesnt quite live like we do
3626444 we found out yesterday and to be honest it sucks
3626445 to see this happen to someone who came out here and worked his ass off and wanted it so bad and is a great guy to have this happen to him is unfortunate we loved having him around
3626446 we go out after games together we travel together and have fun together
3626447 whenever you lose somebody like that especially when its out of your control and the person doesnt want to go either it makes it even tougher
3626448 ive got to go back and do my job and im going to try and stay in shape and keep working out while staying in contact with the argonauts and hopefully something can be worked out next year but at this time i have a commitment i have to fulfill and thats what i have to do
3626449 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3626450 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3626451 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3626452 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3626453 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3626454 actually im working for the department of defence if something alarming goes down i might have to enter my coordinates and be picked up by helicopter
3626455 sometimes thats like can you enjoy the good times right now the same as whether you can enjoy the bad times
3626456 i think you can have a good day regardless of whats happening i think theres more pressure to have a good day when things are good because you are supposed to feel a certain way if you dont feel that way does that mean theres something wrong with you no it means that you have the whole thing wrong which is that good day or bad day the way that you feel is the way that you feel and it usually doesnt match up
3626457 i thought like that thing when someone says hey you want to come to dinner
3626458 but the idea of actually playing the actor whos playing a black guy is more of a fun read than it is a good idea for a thing to do in your career maybe it goes well and you can open up the los angeles times and read that robert downey jr is flat out hilarious like i did this morning or youre vilified for having made a decision to do something that people thought was offensive
3626459 with sherlock holmes im like okay theyre going to pay me to do this movie and i dont have a f ing idea in my head
3626460 i go wait maybe it should be like this then no you dont want to do that damn it i hope i figure this out before we start shooting now im in fear and anxiety
3626461 sometimes its hard to stay grounded at the best of times
3626462 am i cool right now am i being honest right now am i taking care of myself right now have i offended anyone do i need to make an apology to anyone and have i eaten before noon
3626463 vi kommer att vara ute s l nge vi har lust
3626464 its all of our duties its all of our duties to help people see the moral and ethical dimensions of climate change
3626465 the more the chinese become dependent on the rest of the world the more the rest of the world has influence
3626466 i dont think we should legitimize their government which oppresses people
3626467 of course youre going to root for the american team
3626468 the one big glaring thing right now is weve got to find somebody who can run the football coach david cutcliffe said
3626469 the loss of requan certainly put a big damper on our running game
3626470 tony is leading because hes been here the longest but he has not had a lot of practice said cutcliffe who switched jackson from defensive back late in spring drills
3626471 nobody has asserted themselves at all to this point im scouring the team to try to find who can help us at that position
3626472 i need a guy when there are three yards or four yards he gets four yards said cutcliffe noting that harris showed that grind it out grit until he got hurt
3626473 ive got to find us a couple of running backs
3626474 thad had his best day hes doing a good job getting a grasp of the offense managing the offense
3626475 zack continues to make big plays what zack has to show is more consistency putting us in the right play and throwing the ball hes capable of doing that if he challenges himself to make his mechanics consistent
3626476 we got what we wanted out of this scrimmage said cutcliffe who was intently focused and vocal and kept his devils fired up
3626477 the way he was playing he would have been the starter at safety for us thats the way he was going its a big loss for us right now
3626478 reiterates in the strongest possible terms that such behaviour if substantiated is wholly unacceptable
3626479 the talks have not collapsed its just a time out
3626480 these sterling achievements have overcome numerous concerted efforts from some sections of the international community to destabilise our peace and stability and thus cause confusion in our country
3626481 coming election is a crucial one that people are more than desperate and would therefore use any means possible to achieve their selfish motives and i urge you to stay clear of such contracts
3626482 the movement is not form to give you the right to insult adults or to challenge the traditional authority but to complement their efforts
3626483 e always says how much he loves u and misses u he kicked aarons one of his good friends i might add for callin u ugly it was bad by the way i dont think ur ugly
3626484 scientists are already seeing signs of changing occurring more quickly than they expected these signs range from high temperatures low rainfall drought and diseases leading to worsening economic conditions
3626485 the best local example that comes to mind is the recent power crisis our dear nation experienced
3626486 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3626487 if it means staying in this country for 6 months i will do that
3626488 on june 20th my dad and sister pat were having a conversation
3626489 i knew you all were demented and i joined the family anyways

3626497 mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3626498 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when the convention program will focus on renewing americas economy
3626499 when i first started in spring practice i worried he said
3626500 any little thing would scare me now i dont think about it it feels like it never happened
3626501 we think hes going to be fine and play a ton of football said co offensive coordinator steve shankweiler who coaches the offensive line
3626502 hes much further along than he was in the spring
3626503 that was hard to take that i would have to live without football he said
3626504 as a child he always wanted to do the right thing
3626505 terences faith patience and perseverance tells a lot about his character armen said
3626506 hes an extraordinary young man and hes getting a second chance at life
3626507 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3626508 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3626509 im quite confident they will resolve all their outstanding matters which would result in this inclusive government and in the second instance then acting together
3626510 i wouldnt know about it we are facilitating discussions among three parties
3626511 no deal has been signed by anyone dialogue is still continuing
3626512 i think we should petition for them not to cancel the l word
3626513 i know that you can have your mind do the walking
3626514 they have a number you can call just leave a message they get enough of them maybe it will help
3626515 well actually i think either shane and jenny should get together or shane and max
3626516 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3626517 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3626518 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3626519 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3626520 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3626521 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3626522 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3626523 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3626524 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3626525 who are open to doing something on the production side
3626526 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3626527 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3626528 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3626529 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3626530 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3626531 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3626532 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3626533 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3626534 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3626535 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3626547 theres a swing in mood from supply concerns to falling demand particularly in the united states but attention is beginning to turn to europe and asian economies as well
3626548 in the aftermath of that interview while i was advised by the superintendent of schools not to make any public comments and while i had to move out of my own house to avoid news reporters and harassing phone calls the mayor held a press conference and publicly slandered my reputation my integrity and my intelligence
3626549 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3626550 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3626551 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3626552 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3626553 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3626554 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3626555 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3626556 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3626557 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3626558 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3626559 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3626560 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3626561 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3626562 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3626563 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3626564 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3626565 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3626566 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3626567 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3626568 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3626569 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3626570 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3626571 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3626572 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3626573 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3626574 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3626575 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3626576 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3626577 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3626578 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3626579 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3626580 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3626581 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3626582 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3626583 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3626584 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3626585 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3626586 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3626587 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3626588 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3626589 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3626590 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3626591 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3626592 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3626593 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3626594 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3626595 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3626596 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3626597 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3626598 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3626599 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3626600 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3626601 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3626602 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3626603 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3626604 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3626605 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3626606 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3626607 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3626608 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3626609 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3626610 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3626611 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3626612 after that first inning when they had us down 10 0 i think everybody in the ballpark and everybody in all of massachusetts thought that the game was over

3626620 der ganze weg bis zu dieser entscheidung war vermurkst da kann man nicht viel mehr falsch machen
3626621 unterm strich war die grundentscheidung richtig denn wir haben unsere besten athleten hier nach peking geschickt
3626622 sie haben zu zwei dritteln auf einem sicheren qualifikationsplatz gelegen am schluss haben die kr fte gefehlt
3626623 der ganze weg bis zu dieser entscheidung war vermurkst da kann man nicht viel mehr falsch machen
3626624 ich habe damals eine sportliche entscheidung gefordert dann h tte es keine diskussion gegeben die mannschaft die sich durchgesetzt h tte w re mit einem guten gef hl zu den spielen gefahren
3626625 es ist ein riesenschaden f r den deutschen rudersport entstanden das h tte nicht sein m ssen
3626626 was man verlangen muss ist die soziale absicherung unserer athleten damit man auch mal zwei jahre intensiv trainieren kann wir m ssen unsere athleten intensiver f rdern
3626627 das argument der mangelnden professionellen bedingungen kommt immer aber das ist v lliger bl dsinn die jungs trainieren sehr professionell sind h ufig in trainingslagern ich wei nicht warum man noch professioneller trainieren soll
3626628 with preliminary exploration work yielding positive results we are eager to proceed to the next phase of exploration
3626629 we are currently in positive discussions with institutional investors and private accredited investors outside of the united states some of the interested parties may require the company co list on the tsx venture exchange
3626630 wow britney must be in awesome shape to dance so feverishly and her voice still be perfect
3626631 we believe ubs investment bank will be not fully owned or even potentially disposed of by ubs over the next two years
3626632 by separating these three divisions ubs now has the strategic flexibility to sell merge or float them on the stock exchange
3626633 but it is dangerous to make such a decision in a moment of crisis the bank can afford to postpone until the weather is better
3626634 it would make no sense to sell at the moment as it would not get a fair price in the prevailing conditions
3626635 if the bank was split into three very distinct groups with not much in the way of common services and infrastructure then it would be a much more attractive strategic target because an aggressor could buy the whole and could sell off retail and commercial banking for example
3626636 at the moment there would still be too much work to do to achieve this
3626637 wait are you from the getty family why dont you do something about these gas prices
3626638 if hed stayed with sienna hed be spending that much per hour on child support and crab ointment 800 bucks is a bargain

3626640 i know one baby is missing her tooth but i have no proof but i dont think for sure all the countries are going by the rules
3626641 if you think our girls are little because of looks then maybe you should think the european and americans are strong because of the doping
3626642 i just stood there until my name came up it seemed like forever i think that could have contributed to my fall i was pretty nervous
3626643 i have to live with my mistakes and just try to put a smile on my face and remember we won a silver medal
3626644 id be very surprised if this hasnt arrived in the uk by 2009
3626645 we really worked and we were well prepared but unfortunately we made two mistakes and you cannot win gold with two mistakes
3626646 excited about the marriage of spiritual formation and evangelism that alpha brings
3626647 sure we can boy or something like that laughter that what he said to me
3626648 and they see the white throne and nearly everything they see up there is white thats what god is is white light but you got all the colors in it and up there they see one another as white light
3626649 but what about the shape process and the interview with the ministry leader it is extremely imperative that you go through the proper channels
3626650 the very life force existing in a radiation of an energy from which all things evolved
3626651 god made everything out of himself and somehow he put a part of himself into everything
3626652 some innocent people have been locked up for yearts waiting for someone to prove their innocence or waiting for family members to buy them out of prison some families are too poor to extend an offer of payment for their loved one
3626653 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3626654 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3626655 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3626656 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3626657 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3626658 the governor absolutely must deliver the resources needed to make this mandate succeed
3626659 gateway to critical thinking pivotal for success in science engineering and technology
3626660 i am certain that some will oppose this goal as unattainable and overly aggressive
3626661 its too early to put a price tag on these efforts and more critical to identify the elements of the plan i do think that we have had better conversations about algebra and math readiness in the last 20 days than weve had in the last 20 years
3626662 we really need the money now we need this plan now
3626663 im glad to see the state superintendent is embracing the goal of teaching algebra to all california eighth graders and moving forward to improve educational achievement in california
3626664 i look forward to working with the education community to determine the best way to implement and support californias nation leading algebra i test standard
3626665 the best way we know of to get kids ready for algebra in the eighth grade is to get them to grade level in mathematics and arithmetic in seventh grade
3626666 they shouldnt need more money to get the kids to where theyre supposed to be
3626667 were pleased to see things out on the table so that we can sit down and discuss this for the betterment of the students
3626668 its always a problem when the state shoots first and asks questions later
3626669 given that students have a constitutional right to education its always problematic when the state sets a standard but doesnt provide the resources to achieve it
3626670 a lot of the kids were capable but they werent disciplined enough to sit down and do their homework every night
3626671 at redwood we saw a lot of kids that came in and then had to repeat algebra i again in the ninth grade
3626672 we have many fine programs out there in excellent districts that are and have been doing this for years
3626673 adam was created in the wilderness outside of the garden of eden eve was created in the garden
3626674 the journey to the cross should be the last useless journey
3626675 do not make the pathetic error of clinging to the old rugged cross
3626676 the name of jesus christ as such is but a symbol it is a symbol that is safely used as a replacement for the many names of all the gods to which you pray
3626677 the oneness of the creator and the creation is your wholeness your sanity and your limitless power
3626678 the atonement is the final lesson he man need learn for it teaches him that never having sinned he has no need of salvation
3626679 bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ
3626680 even though you may think this or that there is an element of righteousness inside of him obama to reach out for jesus
3626681 this is not my obama endorsement its kim clements prophecy concerning obama
3626682 there is a sway in the political arena a change in your political world enough of this discussion about jeremiah wright
3626683 this makes no difference it is a spirit that has endeavored to rock and sway the people and to divide them
3626684 to rule and to reign and to declare victory in the middle east
3626685 even though you may think this or that there is an element of righteousness inside of him to reach out for jesus therefore i will sway it next week
3626686 and i will cause my man my power to exalt in the white house what is necessary to declare victory for this time i shall rise up and i shall make known who i am in a way that i have never done it in this nation
3626687 do not say it is this one or it is that one
3626688 do not say is it this one or is it that one hear me out i am raising up my mantle my voice this nation shall be awakened to a spiritual activity that has been dead for 42 years listen to me
3626689 i will take over in a way and in a fashion that will bring a force of spiritual unity in this nation for the first time you can believe it or not i will take white and i will take african and i will bring a unity in the church between the two of them
3626690 it shall not be black it shall not be white it shall not be hispanic
3626691 where one race stood on the steps and covered the fields with million men marches and jesus proclamations there shall be one of the greatest gatherings at the capitol that you have ever seen
3626692 this time it shall not be black it shall not be white it shall not be hispanic it shall not be from this or that belief but there shall be a unified sound two years from now where they will hear the sounds of faith and unity and within this next reign there will be laws that will be changed in favor of the most high god not because of democrat not because of republican but because of spiritual unity and intervention i will bring you out of what they call a recession into your highest economy that youve ever had in your next four years
3626693 do not think it impossible for it shall be so
3626694 the gatekeepers i am speaking of of this nation are the spiritual leaders the apostles and the prophets the teachers the evangelists the pastors
3626695 for the gatekeepers of this nation are not the mayors nor the senators the gatekeepers of this nation are not the congressmen or the congresswomen yes they are gatekeepers but the gatekeepers i am speaking of of this nation are the spiritual leaders the apostles and the prophets the teachers the evangelists the pastors that ive raised up and there shall be a sound of unity that will call from heaven the manifestation of god as it has never been in this nation get ready for your sons and your daughters who will prophesy just like joel said in the last days in the last days your sons and your daughters they shall be prophets and prophetesses and your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall have visions this is that time
3626696 call them not denominations rather abominations for i am not speaking of these that have built walls im speaking of the true warriors that shall sway the political field that will sway the justice it shall be more than a million gathered more than a million gathered
3626697 i will take the oil crisis and bring it to an end
3626698 your present president will not leave his office or his term in shame
3626699 the branch of philosophy that examines the nature of reality including the relationship between mind and matter substance and attribute fact and value

3626701 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except by me
3626702 meditation is the basic activity that underlies all metaphysics and is the primary source of spiritual direction for the new age person we need only observe the emphasis which is placed on meditation to see the importance of it in new age thought
3626703 bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ
3626704 hereby you know the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god

3626715 three weeks ago i was in the uk and i was praying i was praying every day in a small room one afternoon i saw a stone a huge stone it was falling on the city of san francisco and that stone completely affected a large area the bay area i didnt share this with anyone but danny today it seems like the lord is about to do some incredible things

3626721 take nothing away from united because theyve been fantastic but they have had a lot of players in their team who have hit the peak of their form in the last two years
3626722 united know that every year were going to give them a right good go for their money we are no longer a nearly team
3626723 we need to raise the bar at the end of the day last season we wasnt good enough
3626724 it still hurts me to see pictures of united lifting those trophies
3626725 now we need to set ourselves big targets to win the premiership win the fa cup and get back to the final of the champions league and win it those are the targets
3626726 luiz felipe scolaris a very experienced man like ferguson and knows exactly what hes doing
3626727 im sure the manager has a few tricks up his sleeve along the way and hopefully we can stop him getting involved in any of the taking an early lead in the premiership and elading all the way
3626728 the treatment causes cancer cells to self destruct and blocks the growth of the blood vessels needed to fuel tumours with oxygen and nutrients
3626729 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3626730 i sometimes think that being widowed is gods way of telling you to come off the pill
3626731 no woman can call herself free who does not own and control her body no woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother
3626732 the pill to a great degree made possible the hetero sexual revolution yet those who developed oral contraceptives did not intend to promote what the majority of americans at the time called promiscuity
3626733 the freedom that women were supposed to have found in the sixties largely boiled down to easy contraception and abortion things to make life easier for men in fact
3626734 in destroying the power of giving life through contraception a husband or wife is doing something to self this destroys the gift of love in him or her

3626758 im sure a lot of belgians feel it is unfair the champions of a country have to play a qualifying round to get into the champions league
3626759 im sure people in belgium were hoping that once you win your championship that you would automatically qualify for the champions league like some other countries do such as england germany spain and so on
3626760 it is going to be a very difficult two matches to qualify for the next stage of the champions league
3626761 people here in belgium were probably hoping for a more favourable draw but we are still relishing the opportunity to play against liverpool
3626762 we definitely respect liverpool they are a great and huge club they have a great history especially in terms of the champions league so we will have our work cut out for us
3626763 hopefully we will be able to rise to the occasion in the two matches that lay ahead there is always belief
3626764 im sure that the people of liverpool are probably happy with the draw and hopefully we can use that to our advantage
3626765 you never know in football we have a lot of good players here
3626766 i played against torrse this summer and i think i did pretty well
3626767 obviously the belgian league is not as respected as the premier league but i feel that we have quality players that can possibly make a difference on any given day
3626768 any win against liverpool is going to be a big win but for me it was so because it was my first start at home and first win with them
3626769 it will always stay a big souvenir for me in terms of my newcastle experience but that is in the past and i tend not to dwell on the past too much and try to concentrate on the future
3626770 a lot has changed at liverpool a lot of different players have come into that team
3626771 fernando torres is a great player and i had the opportunity to play against him this summer when the us played against spain
3626772 it was 1 0 to spain torres played the first half and at the end of that it was 0 0
3626773 personally i think i defended pretty well against him although he was also coming off an injury so he probably wasnt at 100
3626774 he has a lot of different tricks in his arsenal and you have to be on your toes at all times and concentrate
3626775 but there is not just one player that we have to be aware of it is the whole squad
3626776 ive always said that my ambitions are to leave belgium for a bigger league if that be england then that would be great
3626777 ive matured a lot and progressed in a lot of different factors and aspects of my game since 2007
3626778 i feel as though i had a short stint in order to adapt to the style of the premier league
3626779 sometimes it takes players six to eight months to get used to the premier league style
3626780 by no means are we giving up on clay buchholz
3626781 far from it we still think hes going to be a huge part of our future and may well prove to be an important part of our present
3626782 that said we think this move gives us the freedom to do the right thing in our rotation rather than maybe forcing people into roles because of injury so well see how things play out but by no means is clay buchholz out of our picture
3626783 we think byrd can add a veteran presence some stability to our starting rotation
3626784 hes been on a roll lately since the all star break hes been pretty darn good every time out there
3626785 this is a guy whos been through this before hes someone we think can be dependable for us and we know what were going to get every fifth day
3626786 it just seems like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer given the fact that tim wakefield is on the dl bartolo colons still rehabbing buchholz is still working through some things you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3626787 hes going to consistently locate and throw strikes and change speeds and show great feel on the mound
3626788 you only get so many chances to win it all last year was really tough for us and for me to get traded to the team that beat us feels a little weird i cant wait to get started and give the people of boston all ive got
3626789 i think i was tipping my pitches a little bit
3626790 i changed my glove and its rock hard so if i cover first ill be in trouble but i cant wiggle it and give away pitches i changed my motion so i wasnt going over my head with my hands anymore its enabling me to keep the ball down a little bit
3626791 ive had an up and down season its been a roller coaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident i like the way im throwing the ball i have no fear no wonder about which pitcher is going to show up

3626798 i always bring something back to the table that enriches our club
3626799 qantas discovered an irregularity with paperwork for these aircraft during an internal integrity check of maintenance records
3626800 business class standards continue to be upgraded by airlines across the world and singapore airlines managed to retain their title amidst this growing level of competition
3626801 it is the whole business class package that is evaluated from airport lounges ground services to the quality of cabin seating inflight entertainment catering and of course the cabin staff service
3626802 when we look at more localised studies reporting etc we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey we do find that many countries flag carrier airlines suffer fairly vitriolic levels of reporting in their local regions and the airline industry remains a business that some areas of the press seem to love to hate
3626803 another closely contested survey category the best first class lounge award is a true recognition of top end quality being delivered and qantas have set a clear benchmark with their first class facilities at sydney airport this lounge in sydney is the flagship for qantas designed by australian marc newson the lounge concept for both product and staff service has been modelled around the finest quality you would expect to find in a 5 star hotel or restaurant and the best part is that the concept is being so well delivered by qantas
3626804 smaller than its national counterpart korean air asiana airlines are developing an ever increasing level of customer support achieving some of the highest levels of customer satisfaction across todays airline industry some innovative cabin service concepts clearly contribute towards their success but it is more apparent that asiana airlines is gaining a worldwide reputation based on the concept of superb customer service

3626808 as i visit pc lujan where we have special programs i see a critical need for one to one aides so then that really triggers a button that i need make sure that they become a priority
3626809 of course who wants to commit to spending three years with a series2 box when a hdtv is going to become more common in the next few years and b series2 boxes are going to fall in price

3626894 in a technical sense export and domestic demand are created equal but just in the sense of judging the health of the economy theyre not created equal
3626895 if youre looking at the output data the economys holding up surprisingly well
3626896 if you were just looking at the employment data youd be concluding that the u s is in a recession
3626897 gdp excluding the foreign sector youve had pretty bad numbers
3626898 whether youre selling to a domestic consumer or abroad its still production
3626899 when you measure household wages in terms of their output prices it looks good when you measure it in terms of the things they want to buy it looks bad
3626900 what we export buys less and less in terms of imports
3626901 one reason why the economy maybe feels worse than headline gdp says
3626902 the taf is indicating that theres more severe credit problems out there
3626903 the banking sector just cant get one foot in front of the other
3626904 most directors considered the benefits of maintaining the peg to outweigh the cost of higher short term inflation provided current inflationary pressures prove temporary
3626905 if however inflation should persist and the gulf cooperation council monetary union be delayed they recommended to consider also alternative exchange rate regimes
3626906 global economic activity continues to expand but at a slower pace sluggish growth in the advanced economies is expected to continue at least until the first half of 2009 the rapid growth in the emerging markets is likely to soften according to advance estimates released by the bureau of economic analysis u s real gdp growth was 1 9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 the contribution of net exports to u s growth was a robust 2 4 percent in fact net exports have partially offset the negative drag from private residential investment especially since 2007 although this positive contribution could diminish as global growth slows
3626907 you dont have to be a technician to look at that chart and recognize something new is going on back in 2003 global gdp began pulling away from oil production note that oil broke out over 32 shortly thereafter and never looked back in the annual businessweek forecasts 2004 i was one of a handful of strategists that picked energy as my top sector its also pretty clear that all of the hullaboo on off shore drilling is just so much political nonsense yes we should be drilling no it wont make much of a difference in prices
3626908 i would recommend the system of mortgage credit used in denmark where loan to value ratios and underwriting standards are strictly enforced by a single strong regulator these mortgages are transformed into instantly tradable bonds cover for the bonds is provided by both the mortgages and the credit of the financial institutions issuing them the mortgages remain on the balance sheets of the issuers eliminating the moral hazard inherent in the us system which is based on earning fees from selling them on to the market the standardization of mortgages in the danish system promotes transparency and liquidity householders can prepay their mortgages at any time by buying the bonds since house values and bond prices tend to move in unison this arrangement reduces the danger of householders equity falling into negative territory for the issuing banks owning these bonds carries lower capital requirements so the bonds sell at a premium to ordinary covered bonds this system has survived and provided affordable home mortgages since its creation shortly after the great copenhagen fire of 1795
3626909 very large majorities of domestic and foreign respondents pointed to a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook their banks reduced tolerance for risk and the worsening of industry specific problems as reasons for tightening their lending standards and terms on c amp i loans over the past three months

3626914 isnt it not just for wall street but for the entire country we were on a binge
3626915 absolutely theres a lot of truth in what the president said and in terms of wall street there is too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than than people recognized because the leverage came in into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand

3627067 they did not concede many goals they have a strong defence and a quick attack we must concentrate

3627097 were the ones who seemed a little uncomfortable of the idea that the player was almost like god creating the species and deciding the evolutionary process of it eurogamer had the opportunity to talk to the genius behind the game
3627098 i think our bigger fear was that we didnt want to offend any religious people but looking at the discussion that unfolded from this thing what we had was a good sizable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players
3627099 we didnt want to go too far down that path we leave the whole creation of the universe question open obviously as the player youre coming in and playing something like a god directing the evolution of a species but we never really state who you the player are

3627161 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
3627162 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
3627163 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
3627164 i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up

3627166 now i know some say ive been too tough on folks about this responsibility stuff but im not going to stop talking about it
3627167 it starts with teaching our daughters to never allow images on television to tell them what they are worth and teaching our sons to treat women with respect and to realize that responsibility does not end at conception that what makes them men is not the ability to have a child but the courage to raise one
3627168 what makes them men is not the ability to have a child but the courage to raise one

3627179 a road map for the individual and their family to re enter the land of the living
3627180 a road map for the individual and their family to re enter the land of the living
3627181 in i will not be broken jerry white brings his insight and experience to bear expertly for those facing lifes unexpected challenges he embodies the spirit of survivorship
3627182 jerry white has written an amazingly poignant book but it does more than capture the collective experience of enduring a tragedy it provides a road map for the individual and their family to put one foot in front of the other and re enter the land of the living this book will be a remarkable tool especially for the many military families impacted by the wars in afghanistan and iraq
3627183 we can choose happiness even after the worst of times jerry white offers an excellent guide to navigating and overcoming the traumas we face in our lives
3627184 this is an important book jerry white shares lessons learned from his experience recovering from a landmine accident to help trauma victims recover survive and thrive
3627185 offers wise practical and inspiring steps to come back from lifes worst setbacks jerry white speaks with compassion and authority and an abundance of emotional intelligence
3627186 i have visited landmine survivors around the world with jerry white i have seen him reach out to others and walk with them on the path from victim to survivor his courageous personal experience is a beacon for all who are searching to recover and reclaim life
3627187 the tank and guns on tiananmen square crushed the hopes of a generation but many refused to stay victims we find new ways to find new hope when i met jerry white i instantly recognized a fellow survivor who understands what it takes to overcome obstacles to hope this book will inspire
3627188 this terrible thing has happened it cant be changed i cant rewind the clock my family still needs me so now what
3627189 i want to say yes to the future i want my life to go on in a positive way
3627190 how do i want to live the rest of my life what steps can i take today
3627191 how can i be an asset to those around me and not a drain will i ever feel grateful again
3627192 they say what doesnt kill you makes you stronger its not quite that simple i believe you have to decide it will make you stronger experience has taught me that happy endings can never be taken for granted they must be chosen
3627193 we are surrounded by survivors who have gone before us and their examples will help mark the way forward their experiences show us that with the right support everyone can recover and thrive as we overcome hardship there is laughter and hope and love waiting for each of us but it is crucial for us to want those things
3627194 is there really a way to grow stronger in crisis you bet there is i am convinced we not only can toughen under pressure but also soar why because i did and i have watched thousands of others transform tragedy into growth
3627195 because life will happen to all of us violence and terror can be visited upon just about anybody these days life explodes and nothing is ever quite the same im not just referring to a personal injury or illness but also to the world where headlines of terrorism violence and natural disaster assault us with increasing frequency some of us seek consolation in the belief that tragedy is happening somewhere else far away but eventually the bell tolls for you
3627196 i hope my story and those of friends ive met around the world will flicker light in the dark tunnel where too many people feel trapped in pain even better the survivor stories in these pages can teach all of us about moving forward all of us need to learn to manage lifes explosive moments life may change in an instant like mine did in israel but instead of dreading them i want to encourage all of us to honor our toughest dates the tragedies that bind us in an effort to transform victimhood into survivorship
3627197 over the past twenty years i have met and talked survival with everyone from the famous diana princess of wales elie wiesel king hussein and queen noor of jordan john mccain his holiness the dalai lama lance armstrong and the not so famous but equally strong katie ken elizabeth colleen and others each has something to teach us they dont just get by they thrive thats what i aspire to do
3627198 this book illuminates the path to survival five steps that can guide a person from tragedy toward a new life of renewed purpose and hope the steps are not always sequential they can be taken simultaneously they can also spiral skip and repeat survivorship is different for each individual but anyone who has overcome adversity and learned to thrive has come to understand the power of each step
3627199 princess diana understood that to survive means to endure something that could have killed you or taken you down like the loss of a son or daughter like stepping on a landmine these are experiences terrible and terrifying such trauma presents a threshold the outcome positive or negative is not pre ordained we can do things to foster resilience and strength going forward can you recall your date your own before and after moment when life is cut in two by horrible pain or shocking news
3627200 this terrible thing has happened it cant be changed so now what theres little point wishing you hadnt gotten into that car or gotten the tumor or been fired from that job we must face some brutal facts of the here and now its normal to question but you will never get a satisfactory answer and youll only waste time the past is the past and facts are facts
3627201 emotions are facts too but it is quite common to deny the initial experience this is not happening to me i will wake up from this nightmare soon it is also quite common to feel the most intense range of emotions after a loss or crisis
3627202 how can we use the facts that confront us with unpleasant truth to help us survive catastrophe facing facts is so hard because it demands that we come to grips with our worst fears it means admitting what we really think about disability deformity and death all scary stuff most of us would prefer to look away and carry on our merry way without thinking about these things but without a closer look in the mirror examining the wrinkles of our traumatized life we cant make sound decisions and then proceed to change and grow
3627203 crisis and pain can hold us hostage for a time but we still have a choice in how we will respond to our circumstances no matter how dire when something disrupts our life how do we move forward ive seen it time and time again in my work with victims of war atrocities there are those who fight for their lives after devastating loss and those who succumb to their suffering why the difference to truly thrive we must consciously choose for our lives to go on in a positive way i have had to do it more than once most of us have or will
3627204 by choosing life we step across the second threshold of survivorship it may be one of the hardest steps it requires imagination and perspective in the midst of pain it comes on the heels of brutal facts and a long look in the mirror to see who we are and where we stand how do you choose your way forward with scars and bitter memories you dont let your situation define you you reframe how to think about it you choose humor and connections and love you choose to live one of the essential ways we start to embrace life is by reaching out to others
3627205 no one survives on their own and no one thrives alone either yes you might feel an excruciating loneliness after one of lifes hurtful blows but we are simply not built to survive solo isolation will kill us not protect us we humans are social animals made for community even when family and friends annoy the hell out of us they remain an essential part of our survivorship
3627206 sometimes it feels as if we have no instruments we have no leader we have nothing thats when many of us call out to god for many it takes a crisis but in our darkest moments most of us will reach out spiritually its a cry for divine help we need someone anyone out there to understand our prayers reflect an existential plea for empathy in the universe i believe this is a great and useful thing i cant encourage people enough to pray and then pray some more call out reach out your questions and search for meaning are enormously important they reflect a desire to choose life and reach out simultaneously whatever you believe religion can offer a positive source of social and spiritual oxygen
3627207 i am always impressed by the strong bond among veterans including well known american prisoners of war in vietnam such as john mccain their military code of conduct inculcates an attitude of mutual survival with duty to country and to family when i first met senator mccain over lunch in the senate dining room i was immediately struck by his stubborn survivor spirit mccain credits his five plus years of perseverance in the face of torture to his sense of duty to and camaraderie with his fellow navy men and prisoners and a sense of honor instilled in him by the military careers and character of his father and grandfather
3627208 we benefit from belonging from contributing to a bigger thing called community we all have a role with talents and gifts to deploy each act of generosity seeds good will even by listening to another person tell their tale of woe thereby affirming their path you can help build community each of us is born with talents and gifts and they are meant to be deployed not for simple survival but for the good of the community a body is also a metaphor for community and if any one part is hurting the whole body is weak we need to shore each other up and make sure we acknowledge with appreciation people who pray forgive connect the unconnected and serve the more vulnerable among us
3627209 why do some people stay victims well its strangely comfortable a kind of defense mechanism after disaster strikes we welcome sympathy in our hour of need and then we invite it eventually we must break the victim habit and resume taking full responsibility for our future
3627210 im here to tell you that survivors are everyday people in the car next to you behind you in the grocery store next door mowing the lawn i meet these people everywhere from every walk of life on every continent i only wish i could share more of their stories i hope their examples will teach and inspire you to want to thrive just think if someone can overcome that level of crisis or abuse then maybe i can hang in there too just long enough to get through my crisis
3627211 life experience will nourish and make us stronger for example studies of emergency personnel indicate that having survived one traumatic experience increases resilience and in a sense inoculates workers who will face subsequent traumas at work most of us can point to early life experiences that afford us at least some practice in building resilience
3627212 what do survivors say has been helpful during their tough times
3627213 just be ready to pick up on the hints people in crisis my give as to what is needed at any particular time try to make it about that person and not your own hang ups or past traumas maybe your friend wants you to come by every day maybe its just once a week you must assess and reassess the situation be open be kind bring food then run the vacuum and wipe down the kitchen counters after putting the leftovers away in the fridge
3627214 i think grace in part is what allows survivors to bring meaning to our stories its available to all of us moments of awakening without meaning you may survive but you will never inspire and without meaning you cannot ultimately thrive finding meaning in our lives is a way to dispel darkness and break through the barriers that imprison us
3627215 we dont always have to look for larger than life heroes we can be heroes for each other we are just ordinary folk wanting to endure and live life well even during the rough patches but we can all benefit from role models who not only overcome adversity but find the wherewithal to give back and serve the broader community this is how we complete the cycle of survivorship transforming our tragedy and blessing others in the process
3627216 none of the survivors interviewed in this book would call themselves heroes or particularly courageous for that matter they simply did what they had to do
3627217 thrivers are all around us not distant in history or geography they are most often applied optimists pessimists can also thrive but they have to work a bit harder to push through their tendency toward negativity similarly introverts sometimes find it harder to thrive than extroverts given the need to reach out for support during and after a crisis the key is to know yourself so you can work with or compensate for your natural tendencies
3627218 the five steps on our survivor journey offer a way not just to recover not just to survive but to thrive step by step we find power to convert our dates the days that change us to become more than we were before the illness or the accident we understand survivorship is anything but linear its a process that involves three steps forward a flashback or two and then a leap ahead each of us is a mixed breed of survivor and victim some days we can exhibit healthy survivor behavior and then reveal less attractive victim behavior the next no one is perfectly resilient or consistent but we progress day by day step by step if we want
3627219 our desire is to ensure that every stakeholder is content with arrangements and is comfortable with the icc champions trophy taking place in pakistan
3627220 to that end it was agreed that representatives who have attended the latest briefings and demonstrations in lahore and karachi will visit stakeholders who have expressed reservations to let them know of the safety and security measures on the ground
3627221 the results of those meetings will then be fed back to me and also to the icc vice president sharad pawar and icc chief executive haroon lorgat on 20 august so we can make a further assessment of the comfort levels of our participating members
3627222 we are committed to a safe and secure event in pakistan we believe these visits and the feedback we get from them will play a major role in us achieving those ends
3627223 during the recently completed asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt allow us the opportunity to check the security arrangements so there has been no way for us to formulate an opinion on the venue
3627224 we believe that by excluding rawalpindi and using just two venues both of them successful hosts during the asia cup it will remove doubt allow a further concentration of resources and thus improve comfort levels for all stakeholders in the event

3627231 the treaty is finished there is no possibility of going on with it
3627232 every time the people have been consulted they have torpedoed to spectacular effect a model of europe that seems far from what they want
3627233 the existing and enlarged europe continuing as an integrated economy and trade zone loosely associated with the united states in a subordinate role but with no foreign policy or international personality of its own because of the conflicting interests and conceptions of its numerous members
3627234 irrelevance is not particularly dignified or noble but it could still be the logical choice for europe arguably the eu has achieved a sort of nirvana it is too strong to be attacked and too weak to be asked to sort out the rest of the worlds problems europe has become a giant switzerland
3627235 but what if i lost impossible lose to this pitiful duffer yeah but what if
3627236 christ id have to take another mortgage on my house if i lost this my wife would divorce me if she found out i lost this much playing golf with an old man i wont be able to pay my daughters orthodontist
3627237 many spiritually advanced people i know not coweringly religious mind you but deeply spiritual identify obama as a lightworker that rare kind of attuned being who has the ability to lead us not merely to new foreign policies or health care plans or whatnot but who can actually help usher in a new way of being on the planet of relating and connecting and engaging with this bizarre earthly experiment these kinds of people actually help us evolve they are philosophers and peacemakers of a very high order and they speak not just to reason or emotion but to the soul
3627238 we can trace track down and take out terrorists while ensuring that our actions are subject to vigorous oversight and do not undermine the very laws and freedom that we are fighting to defend
3627239 reasonable regulations enacted by local communities to keep their streets safe
3627240 that he is being taken seriously shows how pitifully desperate the american people are at the moment
3627241 david friedman the son of late conservative icon and nobel economist milton friedman has also endorsed obama
3627242 i certainly would be happy if the left became more libertarian since the right seems to be less libertarian than it used to be

3627252 a flawed diamond is better than a common stone that is perfect
3627253 in his time on the national stage he has consistently put his party and his self interest first
3627254 we have seen barack obama forced to choose between principle and the interests of himself and his party he has always chosen the latter
3627255 its a statement of fact that he discards people and he discards positions when they become inconvenient for him
3627256 when politicians say one thing and then do another like senator obama has done voters wonder about the steadfastness of the character of the person sitting in the oval office
3627257 the bottom line about barack obama whatever the position whether it be iraq campaign finance reform public financing hes going to take a tack that allows him to win he wants to win beyond anything else even more than keeping his word
3627258 has demonstrated that there is no position he holds that isnt negotiable he will say or do anything if it furthers his political purposes
3627259 plenty of candidates attract supporters who disagree with them on some issues obama is unusual however he attracts supporters who not only disagree with his stated positions they project their own views onto him and figure he is just saying what other less discerning voters want to hear
3627260 clinton as candidate would have done exactly what obama is doing move toward the center

3627310 we have received complaints from pakistan that adulterated indian brew is being exported
3627311 the export of such tea poses a serious threat for us in the international market we are working on these complaints and are trying to find out factories where colours tea waste and some other material are being used to produce the impure tea
3627312 we will continue to conduct raids in tea producing units on the basis of tip offs and complaints it will be an ongoing exercise to stop the entry of impure tea in the market we will also take steps against those involved in this racket
3627313 we had sent the samples to labs for tests and have already received the report of the one sent from the factory in south india
3627314 it has confirmed our fear that several substances had been mixed with tealeaves to obtain the final product
3627315 we have also recommended the case to the tamil nadu government mentioning that selling adulterated tea is in contravention to the prevention of food adulteration act 1954

3627318 but she complained of pain on the 10th and was taken to the lebong army hospital where some cotton wool were removed yesterday
3627319 some cotton wool had been left behind by dr gorai following the cleanup we strongly condemn the carelessness on the part of the doctor and we demand his arrest
3627320 when there is excessive bleeding doctors do leave behind cotton to stop the bleeding such cottons do give discomfiture and are removed again anytime between 24 and 72 hours
3627321 if instruments had been left behind it would have been an act of negligence and definitely life threatening however if a small amount of cotton is found it could either be intentional and if it was not intentional then too it is not life threatening

3627331 hai orang orang yang beriman bertakwalah kepada allah sebenar benar takwa kepada nya dan janganlah sekali kali kamu mati melainkan dalam keadaan beragama islam dan berpeganglah kamu semuanya kepada tali agama allah dan janganlah kamu bercerai berai dan ingatlah akan nikmat allah kepadamu ketika kamu dahulu masa jahiliyah bermusuh musuhan maka allah mempersatukan hatimu lalu menjadilah kamu karena nikmat allah orang orang yang bersaudara dan kamu telah berada di tepi jurang neraka lalu allah menyelamatkan kamu dari padanya demikianlah allah menerangkan ayat ayat nya kepadamu agar kamu mendapat petunjuk
3627332 dia telah mensyariatkan bagi kamu tentang agama apa yang telah diwasiatkan nya kepada nuh dan apa yang telah kami wahyukan kepadamu dan apa yang telah kami wasiatkan kepada ibrahim musa dan isa yaitu tegakkanlah agama dan janganlah kamu berpecah belah tentangnya asy syura 13
3627333 allah telah mengutus para nabi untuk menegakkan agama menyatukan umat dan meninggalkan perpecahan serta perselisihan
3627334 sesungguhnya allah ridha terhadap kalian pada tiga hal dan membenci kalian pada tiga hal yaitu engkau menyembah nya dan tidak menyekutukannya engkau berpegang teguh pada tali allah dan jangan kalian berpecah belah dan membenci ucapan katanya banyak ucapan dan menyia nyiakan harta
3627335 saya perintahkan kepada kalian dengan lima hal yang allah memerintahkanku dengannya yaitu untuk mendengar taat jihad hijrah dan berjamaah karena orang yang menyelisihi jamaah sejengkal saja maka dia telah melepas tali islam dari punggungnya kecuali bila ia kembai
3627336 jangan kamu mencelanya karena dia telah mendapatkan bau harum dari rasulullah saw
3627337 perpecahan yang terjadi pada umat islam para ulama dan para syaikhnya serta para pemimpin dan pembesarnya sangat disukai oleh musuh musuh islam dan hal itu bisa terjadi lantaran mereka meninggalkan ketaatan kepada allah dan rasul nya sebagaimana firman allah dan di antara orang orang yang mengatakan sesungguhnya kami ini orang orang nasrani ada yang telah kami ambil perjanjian mereka tetapi mereka sengaja melupakan sebagian dari apa yang mereka telah diberi peringatan dengannya maka kami timbulkan di antara mereka permusuhan dan kebencian sampai hari kiamat dan kelak allah akan memberitakan kepada mereka apa yang mereka kerjakan
3627338 dalam hal ini ada beberapa hal yang harus dijaga di antaranya orang yang diam sama sekali pada permasalahan ini apakah orang kafir melihat tuhan mereka oleh sebab itu tidak sepantasnya bagi orang berilmu menjadikan permasalahan ini sebagai tameng untuk mengutamakan saudara saudaranya yang ia sukai dan memojokkan kaum muslimin lainnya yang tidak ia sukai karena yang seperti inilah yang dibenci oleh allah dan rasul nya dan hendaknya jangan membawa permasalahan ini kepada kaum muslimin yang masih awam dikhawatirkan akan muncul fitnah di antara mereka kecuali kalau ada seseorang yang bertanya maka jawablah sesuai dengan kadar ilmu yang kamu miliki
3627339 bold move of rebuilding his reputation in holland after his dismal failure with england
3627340 its a good way to try to start his career again wenger said
3627341 when you go to another country you must convince people you can do the job wenger said
3627342 when you go to a foreign country its always expected that you will do better than local people because if you do the same as local people they dont want you
3627343 i dont think it is a shame that i had to come out here to get a job again mcclaren said
3627344 i just think that is one of the pitfalls of the england job it is high stakes and you know the downside when you take it
3627345 i have always wanted to coach abroad though and to come to holland which is a country with a coaching culture and a player development culture is an interesting thing to do at this stage in my career
3627346 i have just started this journey and the first thing i want to do is be successful here and not just to prove people wrong
3627347 this is the most problematic time ive had at the start of a season wenger said
3627348 we have a big squad at home toure hip senderos hamstring nasri knee diaby thigh and rosicky knee are all injured fabregas hamstring will be out for the next two premier league games
3627349 i dont have much choice it is a young one or a younger one i dont panic because we worked very hard with the young players to build them up johan djourou will play he has been with us three or four years and if after that he cant play one game weve wasted our time
3627350 he has a fantastic engine is good on the ball with a reasonable technique although he has to improve that
3627351 i dont think he has the tricks to play wide
3627352 i dont believe thierry will come back to england if he comes back it will be to arsenal
3627353 vi kan ikke blive ved med at betale mere og mere for et hospitalsv sen hvor langt over halvdelen af udgifterne anvendes til at udskyde d den nogle uger eller m neder
3627354 im not thinking about signing players at the moment because they cannot play against standard liege
3627355 im only concentrating on this game and i have not needed to contact the owners because they cannot help with the preparation for this i prefer not to say anything else
3627356 whats scary sweetie the jungle gym or the other kids

3627359 it has to be the worst case of animal abuse in the history of vermont
3627360 as soon as you step in youre covered head to toe with fleas
3627361 we should be talking about whats happening on the pitch with the uefa cup starting very early for us this season while we are hoping to finish above ninth position in the table
3627362 instead we are talking about whats happening off the field
3627363 it looks as though he jumped bail and hes claiming political asylum as far as were concerned its more like a lunatic asylum
3627364 i remember the four minute mile being broken by the time the year was out five or six people had done it
3627365 i think the suit has changed things a little bit but good people are great no matter what
3627366 we also have the suits which are helping i think that combination of things has excited people
3627367 theyre swimming more aggressively theyre taking a few more risks than before but i think whats changed so dramatically is peoples expectations
3627368 small groups can cause horror to the us and jews alike
3627369 but if he is taking something written by somebody else and putting it together as some sort of compilation to create the book then some different inferences might flow

3627372 currently the number of visas issued is around 760 000 and this will go up to one million in a few years
3627373 the police and military on the other hand need to act differently their faces look like they are made of stone theyre seriously scaring the foreigners in beijing the fact that theyre armed and look sinister just makes things worse thats why ive talked to chinas political authorities and the olympics organizers at our daily meetings ive asked them to get people to smile more
3627374 the central government must give the land to the amarnath shrine board otherwise our protest will continue
3627375 there is nothing left for us to do here but pack up and go
3627376 we have no work because people are not coming to the city center it is a catastrophe

3627380 a few weeks after our conversation i attended a church service in beulah north dakota
3627381 now let me talk about an angelic experience with emma
3627382 todd have you ever seen the angel by the name of emma
3627383 she is releasing the gold which is both the revelation and the financial breakthrough that i am bringing into this church i want you to prophecy that emma showed up in this service the same angel that appeared in kansas city as a sign that i am endorsing and releasing a prophetic spirit in the church
3627384 i dont have the words to describe it you play the game to put yourself in position to be in the playoffs and be in a pennant race now im fortunate enough to have this opportunity

3627389 um i dont think so its uneven i dont want to show you
3627390 i dont care about my appearance why do we have to define ourselves by appearance i prefer defining myself by the things i do
3627391 well no i think i already know how its going to be
3627392 its no surprise to me i am my own worst enemy
3627393 well its definitely quirky so maybe if we keep watching it itll get funny too
3627394 theres a lot of stuff that can be part of the soreness the all star game is a bit of why it happened and i also pitched out of the break on three days rest
3627395 this is the first wall i have hit and if didnt come until 172 innings then i think i have done something right
3627396 i am not so sure theres not residual effect from that there are a number of guys who havent pitched well after the break who threw more than one inning
3627397 we dont think were going to win we know we are
3627398 there will be actual proof of life on a moon of saturn
3627399 paris hilton will actually change her image and earn some respect from the media

3627401 we were looking forward to this right now we are really deep in a hole

3627409 you are right everything does have magic in it from the smallest of insect to the mighty trees of before time
3627410 even you little one but magic is not just spells the magic you see on the outside making pots and pans fly or brewing potions to make boys swoon before you is but a tiny fraction of the power of true magic the real power of magic lies within you who you are what you do and most importantly of all what you may become
3627411 you really think i might have some magic inside me then
3627412 we will keep the best football players the ones that help our football team the most whoever they are
3627413 if we would keep four quarterbacks i would think we could keep five running backs
3627414 they have all been effective for us in the past or given the opportunity lamont has had in his time here he has shown to be effective
3627415 heath laurence sammy kevin and lamont have all been productive with the ball in their hands either running it or catching it and in some cases returning it
3627416 how they mix and match all these personalities and how they come together so smoothly most of the time is something special
3627417 i wish i could figure that out guys like kevin and sammy and laurence whove been together its been real easy but even the guys they bring into the mix they just seem to click
3627418 what makes a lot of guys a good fit here is youre asked to do multiple things
3627419 take it back to troy brown a guy who was an amazing wide receiver but you put him on defense and he doesnt skip a beat
3627420 i think you look around the room you see different styles you see different mentalities different attitudes different talent levels
3627421 so vice president of player personnel scott pioli and bill know what theyre doing they mix and match better than anyone in the league
3627422 kevin has his own style sammy has his heath has his ive got mine lamonts got his that hes bringing to the table
3627423 its just different styles thats going to keep defenses on their toes and having to play different defenses when different backs are in the game
3627424 its the old adage in football the more you can do the more you can stick around
3627425 its good for our fans and i know that our coaching staff and veteran players love every reason they can to step it up and make a point
3627426 i think he still has more wins against us hes one of the few active players who have more wins than losses against us so i hope we can straighten that record out
3627427 hes a great great player hes a great competitor i think the jets got stronger and i think miami got stronger getting pennington ive always thought hes great and he has the highest completion percentage of any nfl quarterback
3627428 im going to let the contract discussions go with the people who handle it
3627429 james is one of the leaders of the team so of course any time you have a leader come back its a good thing
3627430 the proud and the few the few and the proud its pretty short back there right now
3627431 the rotation there is no such thing right now its just kind of grit your teeth and grind it out it makes you better in the end
3627432 it feels a lot better compared to two years ago when i had my rotator cuff surgery it feels really good right now it feels really strong i had a good offseason workout
3627433 usually when you have surgery guys tend to eat more and hang around eating bonbons and watching the stories but coming out i feel a lot better
3627434 from day one when we drafted him to rookie minicamp and spring camp he has done a good job he is a very mature kid and a hard worker football is important to him and he spends a lot of time on it he makes a lot of rookie mistakes but he learns from them and doesnt repeat many of them
3627435 it was definitely good for me to just get back into the swing of things seeing some looks you normally wouldnt see early
3627436 you think most times in the preseason the defense is going to play base defense they pulled some stunts and put some tricks in there and i think it was good for myself to get back into reading things and looking for the holes
3627437 jede mannschaft muss eben sehen wo ihre m glichkeiten liegen um gegner zu bezwingen unsere st rke muss die kondition sein

3627461 there is closer scrutiny as to whether travel is necessary and companies are paying more attention to the reason behind a trip
3627462 there is also a trend to avoid highly restrictive fares and select the lowest mid range fare which has flexibility rather than choose a low cost carrier with full cancellation penalties
3627463 clients appreciate the stability of preferred carriers and are supporting them to ensure certain routes which may be at risk of cancellation

3627494 the governor may soon have to write a letter to the chancellor apologising for the high rate of inflation and saying what if anything he needs to do about it
3627495 dear chancellor i am writing to report that inflation is now above 3 this has come about because we held interest rates too low in the period 2004 6 allowing a credit bubble to emerge the governments decision to switch target from rpi to cpi made our task more difficult as the cpi at the time was lower than the rpi and has since proved to be a very poor indicator of the overall inflation people are experiencing in their daily budgets indeed the gap between rpi and cpi has got larger meaning our failure on inflation as measured by the old target is worse we felt we had to respond to a lower easier target once set the governments love of pfi ppp off balance sheet liabilities and its rapid expansion of public spending and borrowing made conditions far looser in credit markets than was desirable but we did not feel we could take full action to offset the governments own wish to expand borrowing so rapidly we felt the treasury clearly had good policy reasons for wanting to increase public sector costs and the size of the public sector as much as it did it was not for us to try to throttle the economy with very high interest rates to offset this huge public sector expansion i accept that this was wrong in retrospect we were also wrong to keep the markets so illiquid in august and september last year leading to the run on northern rock our options have now been narrowed by the decision to nationalise northern rock this has proved expensive to the taxpayer boosting public spending still more and has meant thanks to eu competition law that we are having to run down a leading mortgage bank at a time of mortgage famine and credit squeeze what should we now do the banks options are very limited if we chase the historic inflation with higher interest rates we will make the credit crunch worse and cause a sharper slowdown or a recession which seems a bad idea if we take no action commentators may well say we are neglecting the high and persistent inflationary problem this is mainly the result now of excess liquidity elsewhere in the world creating strong upward pressure on commodity prices there is little sign of this spilling over into wage increases at home which would give another twist to the inflationary spiral in due course it is quite possible the speculative froth in commodities will be corrected and ease the inflationary impact however it is unfair that all the pressure of adjustment to harder times is currently falling on the private sector with housing and property at the eye of the storm i am very conscious of the governments ambitions and high targets for new housebuilding which are currently unrealistic if the government wishes to rebalance the economy and ease some of the unreasonable pressure on property and finance it needs to reduce its own claims on the economy i suggest the government redoubles its efforts begun with the gershon report to eliminate waste and less desirable spending from the large public sector to help the adjustment i would be happy to assist with this process and can see many easy targets yours etc

3627507 vast regions everywhere on our planet should develop and mature to the level of present day western systems
3627508 may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days the western world has lost its civic courage
3627509 technical and social progress has permitted the realization of such aspirations the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about an almost unlimited freedom of enjoyment
3627510 is only a question of the good organization of the state the problem of organizing a state however hard it may seem can be solved even for a race of devils
3627511 ambition must be made to counteract ambition the interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place
3627512 policy of supplying by opposite and rival interests the defect of better motives
3627513 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
3627514 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either
3627515 tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent in human nature the world belongs to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems which must be corrected
3627516 everything beyond physical well being and accumulation of material goods all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature are left outside the range of attention of the state and the social system
3627517 the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries
3627518 rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him
3627519 we are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey
3627520 on the way from the renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience but he have lost the concept of a supreme compete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility
3627521 the split in the world is less terrible than the fact that the same disease plagues its two main sections
3627522 it is imperative to review the table of widespread human values
3627523 intolerable despotic repression of mans physical nature in favor of the spiritual one
3627524 we shall have to rise to a new height of vision to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the middle ages but even more importantly our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the modern era
3627525 just because i am a friend to i dare to say these things about democracy
3627526 dick snyder was running s and s back then and he really did believe in the free market of ideas
3627527 i was pretty much free to acquire anyone i wanted
3627528 i brought them books by bill buckley and charles kessler
3627529 and also sidney hook who was hardly a conservative but felt like one to the lefties at harper but of course they were names every time i brought up someone they hadnt heard of they would say no brad we want to do conservative books just not this one there really was no conception of the size of the potential market or what the country was like it was like the famous steinberg drawing with new york as the center of the world that odd liberal version of reality
3627530 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
3627531 it was this spirit that led airlift planes to appear in the sky above our heads
3627532 at first truman was almost alone in thinking that an airlift would work as an effective response to the soviets
3627533 trailblazer in pursuit of oil the re opening of azerbaijan to the west
3627534 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
3627535 so how come at freshmen orientation they taught us about petty worries like stds and alcohol but not how to survive real peril namely earthquakes
3627536 theres nothing in any of these data that would suggest that girls cant do math or arent doing well in math
3627537 age 41 he mathematically could be the grandson of a perpetrator of the armenian genocide instead hes armed with rhetorical skills a smile and turkish government talking points and propaganda
3627538 the role and challenges of turkey in a globalizing world
3627539 he initially said some of the students were being harassed
3627540 i asked you to voluntarily remove your video from youtube because you had no authority to publish it i explained that you needed to obtain for starters the students consent before doing so
3627541 as a result of a third party notification by claremont graduate university claiming that this material is infringing
3627542 i dont see any legal basis to request student faces to be blurred based on the facts as i understand them
3627543 the web site i paid for it to be up for a year
3627544 i didnt want all the art to pile up on me
3627545 the knowledge of individuals taken as a whole is far greater than that of any commission or board however diligent and expert the magic of the system of prices and of economic markets is that they incorporate a great deal of diffuse knowledge
3627546 a government that is unlimited in scope but formless in action
3627547 it looks as if hes done far better than just passing
3627548 if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
3627549 i didnt take it lightly that a high priced lawyer who has represented celebrities like cameron diaz and lou rawls was hired by officials at a university with unlimited spending power to make my life miserable i had no idea to what lengths claremont graduate university would go to jerk around a little guy exercising his first amendment rights
3627550 claremont officials had enough appreciation for free speech to allow an armenian genocide denier to speak as an honored guest at their university but when it came to news coverage of the event which is protected by the untied states constitution they seemingly concocted a reason to squash free speech i can only assume the phone call from a lawyer was a not too subtle effort to shut me up
3627551 theres nothing in any of these data that would suggest that girls cant do math or arent doing well in math
3627552 the claremont port side has changed drastically over the past year
3627553 the magazine has undergone a complete redesign from an expanded and professional looking website including
3627554 the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society
3627555 we figured if somebody in the government thought otherwise wed hear about it
3627556 the courts concern with legitimacy is not for the sake of the court but for the sake of the nation to which it is responsible
3627557 simplification and increased efficiency of storebrandsoperations are a top priority
3627558 developments in the equity markets and level of interestrates are regarded as the most important risk factors that couldaffect the groups profit in the next six months
3627559 the storebrand group was well capitalised at the close ofthe first six months
3627560 the ducks cost as much as the scope mouthwash we put in the rooms as much as the shampoo we put there the toilet tissue the soap
3627561 in my judgment none of those things ever brought back a customer
3627562 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3627563 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3627564 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3627565 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3627566 globally there have been concerns about a credit crunch andescalating oil prices in the mainland the rising food pricesand post earthquake reconstruction programmes could add toinflationary pressures
3627567 we are set for two quarters of decidedly negative earningsgrowth
3627568 its not easy for blackstone and super ocean to reach adeal as super ocean is probably asking too much for theseproperties
3627569 do you ever feel like youre working for something youre never going to get you shoot amp miss kind of deal like no matter what you cant have it but that makes you fight for it just a little bit more
3627570 do you ever feel like youre working for something youre never going to get you shoot amp miss kind of deal like no matter what you cant have it but that makes you fight for it just a little bit more
3627571 frankly i didnt think investors would react to the gdpdata this much
3627572 but it probably made them reconfirm that the recession willcontinue throughout this year or even until the end of thisbusiness year the data could be used as an excuse to run awayfrom risk assets
3627573 faithful saint and majestic the value of multiple limbs hangs in front of our pathes
3627574 the sea came and stormed it crashed into the formula of a cursive language written on the walls can it see me is it me that has been called it is a dampered cloth from the serpents height fear not of the girl in sight but of her friends that crawl delightfully at night
3627575 all distrust must here be left all cowardice must be here dead
3627576 you never never learn you came to see me break im feellinglightly and im swimming in my pink pool im depths below your waste
3627577 the premeditated slaying of john lennon with an essentially clear mind
3627578 your conduct thus precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals
3627579 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant offense and undermine respect for the law
3627580 can i refill your eggnog for you get you something to eat drive you out to the middle of nowhere and leave you for dead
3627581 clark i think itd be best if everyone went home before things get worse
3627582 worse how could things get any worse take a look around here ellen were at the threshold of hell
3627583 whats that sound you hear it its a funny squeaky sound
3627584 you couldnt hear a dump truck driving through a nitroglycerin plant
3627585 huge armies in a field running towards each other with sticks and rocks and bows and arrows and knifes and swords until they crash into each other in the middle of the field
3627586 how are things at the happiest place in the mall
3627587 all these players whove gone abroad its a loss of talent for the team but its also a source of pride for chinese people
3627588 were representing singapore and even though were chinese when we play we give it our all
3627589 anyhow were just not capable of posing a threat against china
3627590 this is just going to be help us to make the next generation stronger to build up a very solid system domestically
3627591 the last few weeks this ballclub has really been playing hard
3627592 and then the addition of manny has certainly picked up the personality of this club we feel this is an important week for us
3627593 it seems like its been a long time since ive been out there
3627594 it was good to be able to throw strikes again
3627595 i think a combination of not getting some wins over there in oakland and then coming over here in a trade and trying to justify the trade i think he put too much pressure on himself
3627596 and i think finally he just kicked back and relaxed a bit
3627597 any time youre challenging guys and getting them out you dont want to change too many things and i felt like i was very aggressive
3627598 probably the most aggressive ive been in a while so i think that was a good sign
3627599 the more the chinese become dependent on the rest of the world the more the rest of the world has influence
3627600 i dont think we should legitimize their government which oppresses people
3627601 of course youre going to root for the american team
3627602 its my best time so im happy about that but obviously its frustrating that im not going to be in the final
3627603 im not going to let it weigh me down too much because ive got a much bigger battle to take of in about two weeks
3627604 i am so happy i came here and did this its been an amazing experience its everything i hoped it would be now ive got to take care of my life
3627605 eric has a better understanding of what i have been through in the last year
3627606 i need to talk to you about a health issue
3627607 i told him you can look at it one of two ways
3627608 now ive got a much bigger battle and i know im going to win that one
3627609 weve been losing too many games in the seventh inning and later
3627610 were getting him checked out were very suspicious hes not right
3627611 hes not right i know that for a fact i dont know if hes hurt but hes not right
3627612 weve got to try and be patient with him and hope he learns something every time he goes out there
3627613 we need to make significant progress in the next couple days
3627614 we will know in a the next week or so the likelihood of the deal getting done or not
3627615 i feel his jealous flames burning away the darkness hidden in my heart
3627616 obviously juan vlad and ga driving the ball out of the park was big from the offensive side
3627617 after you go through them two or three times theres a chance theyre going to get you
3627618 it covers a lot of territory where john flynn of flynn of the inland fame worked and where frontier services is still working in fact the theme of our promotional events will be in the footsteps of flynn
3627619 this will be an entirely new direction for frontier services but one which we think has great potential for raising awareness and donations towards our work
3627620 youre going to be up and down you just have to stay humble and try to help the team in any way you can
3627621 starter made one mistake and our offense got shut down
3627622 this is the message of balaam son of beor the message of the man whose eyes see clearly 4 the message of one who hears the words of god who sees a vision from the almighty who bows down with eyes wide open
3627623 lord help me to see clearly speak the words you give me and bow down with eyes wide open help me to live by faith and be a first hand witness of your goodness and grace help me to spend my life on the things that are eternal amen

3627629 si ricorrer allalcol ogni volta che si avranno difficolt in pratica dipendenza
3627630 tre ragazzi su 4 fra 16 e 25 anni bevono alcolici ricorda caporaso e se si abbassa let a 15 anni un anno in meno del limite di legge per poterli acquistare i dati non cambiano beve il 67
3627631 il problema anche medico negli adolescenti lalcol viene metabolizzato con maggiore difficolt e i danni al fegato e al sistema nervoso sono maggiori che negli adulti cos si facilita linsorgenza di malattie del fegato come la steatosi fegato grasso e la steatoepatite che nel corso degli anni possono trasformarsi in cirrosi ed epatocarcinoma
3627632 i giovani non si accontentano di vino o birra preferiscono i drink a base di superalcolici ma devono capire che il loro un errore gravissimo
3627633 superare la soglia indicata dalloms aumenta la probabilit di contrarre un danno epatico indipendentemente dalle bevande che si assumono siano esse vino birra o superalcolici
3627634 e stato accertato che un consumo superiore agli 80 grammi al giorno per 10 anni aumenta di 5 volte il rischio di cancro del fegato puntualizza il gastroenterologo un ruolo lo svolgono anche il sesso maschile e let
3627635 if all the 20 million went into paid media and outreach efforts and not enough into community support networks it would miss a key opportunity
3627636 you could spend 50 million or 100 million but until you get to the ground level like in a supermarket youre not going to get hispanics to vote
3627637 its not high school spanish in ad campaigns that does it we need to feel like were significant we need face to face we all want to see the body
3627638 esta es la historia de elric antes de que fuera llamado asesino de mujeres antes del colapso final de melnibon sta es la historia de la rivalidad con su primo yyrkoon y del amor por su prima cymoril antes de que esa rivalidad y ese amor provocaran el incendio de imrryr la ciudad de ensue o saqueada por las hordas de los reinos j venes sta es la historia de las dos espadas negras la tormentosa y la enlutada de c mo fueron descubiertas y del papel que desempe aron en el destino de elric y de melnibon un destino que iba a conformar otro mayor el del propio mundo esta es la historia de cuando elric era el rey el jefe m ximo de los dragones las flotas y de todos los componentes de la raza semihumana que hab a regido el mundo durante diez mil a os sta es la historia de melnibon la isla del drag n es una historia de tragedias de monstruosas emociones y de elevadas ambiciones una historia de brujer as traiciones y altos ideales de agon as y grandes placeres de amores amargos y dulces odios sta es la historia de elric de melnibon gran parte de la cual s lo recordar a el propio elric en sus pesadillas
3627639 women who have not adopted the u s culture seem to be protective against depression symptoms a lot more than those women who are u s born and who are more acculturated or assimilated to u s society
3627640 recent immigrants tend to be healthier than those who have been here for longer periods of time or those who are u s born she said
3627641 the mexican born women were more likely to be married and that in and of itself is a predictor of depressive symptoms
3627642 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
3627643 i think general market is going to be a word of the past in a few years
3627644 general market is going be just another segment among this big interesting group of people these are exciting times numbers are changing by the week in every category so its interesting
3627645 the flip side to this is that multicultural consumers are seeing that they have more choices and are taking advantage of that
3627646 you cant necessarily take for granted like oh weve always had hispanic buyers
3627647 i think the big challenge for the pr industry is going to be if they dont have the talent or expertise to be able to target those respective markets
3627648 i see a lot of general market agencies claim that they do multicultural but i dont think there are enough seasoned professionals that have both pr experience and multicultural expertise
3627649 here in the us there arent a lot of portals that really focus and target asian american consumers in their respective languages
3627650 while they still may be getting news from overseas they still depend on the local papers tv stations and radio for day to day living information
3627651 it is the youth audience that is much more multicultural
3627652 youths of all backgrounds are interested in similar types of music entertainment and products youre making a connection with an audience that is much more multicultural in everything they do how they interact how they communicate and how they want to be communicated to
3627653 there are so many full service chinese restaurants that do takeout thats just an incredible amount of competition for panda express
3627654 a little sweet a little sour and a little spicy
3627655 orange chicken has a huge following using lower cost thigh meat is a tremendous advantage for them at a time when a lot of quick serve chains are going to more expensive breast meat
3627656 i became very attentive to customers because i was desperate not to have people leave and never come back
3627657 were on pace to be the most watched olympics ever
3627658 nbc has a dedicated soccer channel on cable and live stuff on nbcolympics com
3627659 far from being a cannibalizer the internet increases both viewers engagement with tv and their use of it
3627660 most of nbcs increased audience came from people that werent watching tv three weeks ago
3627661 the russians have clearly demonstrated their military capability of getting very close to the pipelines
3627662 and they also sent the black sea fleet off the georgian coast so they also have demonstrated that they can blockade georgia anytime they want
3627663 investors would have to reconsider how attractive those projects are
3627664 for russia control of georgia and the pipeline would restore much of its influence over many of the former satellites of the u s s r
3627665 it would have the clear benefit of increasing russias energy chokehold on europe
3627666 when the russians are trying to claw back their power energy is the major lever in their pursuit to do so
3627667 the georgian president brought in the whole pipeline issue to probably send more worries to the west and especially to the european consumers to draw more attention to the conflict
3627668 its not that we should ignore it but its certainly not a cause to panic
3627669 mr fournier has done nothing but look out for the financial interests of all of his clients and expects to be fully vindicated in the upcoming finra arbitration hearing
3627670 both the timing of ms austins lawsuit and its filing in the los angeles superior court are highly suspect
3627671 any lawyer who commonly practices in this area of the law knows that ms austin is required to pursue her claims before a securities arbitration tribunal and cannot proceed in state or federal court
3627672 the court filing therefore suggests nothing more than a litigation tactic
3627673 first you should select a node of tree on the right
3627674 look its all here everything that roya and i had carved out is still here im really proud of my grandparents for letting this gigantic tree in its wounded aesthetic hang out around these formal grounds lover are you listening to me what are you looking at on that side did you find the crazy looking smiley faces with the bullets drawn on their foreheads lover

3627676 you know the moral police will come and take us to their prison like police station then give us a good whipping and make us get married if the security guard notifies them of our public displays of affection
3627677 i know well maybe theyll make us do it again and we wont be able to serve liquor at the ceremony and we both know how much you would hate that

3627723 but first before i call her down from the guest room i think you should apologize to alaric hes the one who runs things around here not to mention his brother aleron who was the man you encountered in the kitchen
3627724 i apologize sir i have no money and i was hungry
3627725 well youre lucky you found family in this town if any of the other restaurants found a gypsy walking around and trying to steal their food theyd kill ya and feed ya to the dogs

3627737 thats fine with me you get something to eat then you leave thats all i can do for you since what youve done for me was nothing short of disaster
3627738 we dont need more trouble in here than we need
3627739 the soldiers from flavian have already begun to search the town for that lost babe of a princess i dont want to seem suspicious theyre bad for business and you know that bellona
3627740 i suppose that is true i dont like seeing a child all by himself in this world
3627741 take a left at the next exit we want to go through jordan street to get there
3627742 wow i remember you warning me about the traffic situation and driving style here baby doll but i had no idea it was this bad
3627743 excuse me but there seems to be too much traffic entering jordan street if you would like to get to the engagement party on time may i suggest another route madame
3627744 no stay on this path and stop banging on driver
3627745 you know this helps prevent major fires from happening when youre smoking a fag
3627746 its simple really the foil prevents the plastic from catching on fire in the automobile ashtrays i know its brilliant isnt it
3627747 sure ok its good to know how much thought you put into everything
3627748 so do you guys want to party with these blokes
3627749 well its not like were going to make it to the engagement party on time we can go for a bit to let the traffic die down then we can head to your cousins engagement thing
3627750 yeah come on dont be a wet blanket its a celebratory occasion for all of us we owe it to our cousin to start celebrating him right now
3627751 alright wed love to come i think were just going to walk there whats the house number
3627752 i cant believe how dishy he is driver were getting out come and get us down the street to the left at house number 935 in thirty minutes lets go you two
3627753 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3627754 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3627755 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3627756 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3627757 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3627758 if biofuels start to take off we will drop the price of oil
3627759 we may be at a point of peak oil production you may see 100 a barrel oil in the next two or three years but what still is driving this globalization is the idea that is you cannot possibly get rich stay rich and get richer if you dont release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that was true in the industrial era it is simply factually not true what is true is that the old energy economy is well organized financed and connected politically
3627760 by some estimates there will be an average of two per cent annual growth in global oil demand over the years ahead along with conservatively a three per cent natural decline in production from existing reserves
3627761 oil is the only large industry whose leverage has not been all that effective in the political arena textiles electronics agriculture all seem often to be more influential our constituency is not only oilmen from louisiana and texas but software writers in massachusetts and specially steel producers in pennsylvania i am struck that this industry is so strong technically and financially yet not as politically successful or influential as are often smaller industries we need to earn credibility to have our views heard
3627762 he caused all the trouble in the house and that is why i buried him in a separate grave
3627763 i lived with him for six years i feel very bad i cant take it i dream about him and think of him a lot i often feel depressed
3627764 he is a first offender and spent two years awaiting trial he gave his full co operation to the police he did not hamper the investigations
3627765 he was willing to make a statement to a magistrate but fell short of making certain disclosures
3627766 i plead with the court not to hold it against him
3627767 but the presidency was not happy with the proposal and we are in the process of negotiating over it through correspondence
3627768 a result of protracted negotiations on the extent of the commitment and criteria for payment
3627769 these matters have since been resolved and the presidency has made a contingency provision for an amount of r10 million in its budget to cover this risk
3627770 it certainly will be a memorable one for more reasons than one
3627771 it just means that youre old and doing this and somebody keeps being silly enough to give you a job
3627772 but ive never gotten caught up in stuff like this because i figured the time to do this is when im not doing this anymore and then you sort of look back and hopefully admire a lot of things
3627773 in new york joe mccarthy had a pretty good track record obviously
3627774 the thing that impressed me is when you start getting named in the same breath as casey stengel and ralph houk and mccarthy and miller huggins guys like that then it becomes something that gets your attention
3627775 i shouldnt have played i felt something in batting practice
3627776 at some point youre thinking about going for a field goal theres a lot to be said for playing the game and continuing to play because that had a chance to be a really frustrating night and in the end the musics playing and we won thats what we set out to do thats not exactly how we drew it up
3627777 i can say i never have been in a game like that
3627778 after that first inning when they had us down 10 0 i think everybody in this ballpark and everybody in all of massachusetts thought the game was over right there but one thing i can always say about my guys is they play nine innings and they certainly did that tonight
3627779 we were just hoping you could get somebody to come in there and put up some zeroes but it just didnt happen
3627780 there were a couple of times where i put pitches where i wanted to throw it and they put good swings on it theyre a good hitting team but nobody should ever score 10 runs in the first inning off you its pretty embarrassing actually
3627781 our pitchers tried to get it done but the other side has a good swinging team youve got to come up with your big hits
3627782 we needed that we need that type of game the way everybody relaxed loosened up weve got two more months to decide where were going to be at the end of the season thats the kind of game that puts you in the mood and gets you going right away
3627783 that was pretty tiring especially getting in so late in the morning
3627784 but it was a huge win for us to be up 10 runs twice and have them come back they can flat out swing the bats but it was a huge win for us
3627785 theres been some crazy games here in boston but usually its like a college type game with those runs scored
3627786 but it was definitely a good game for us to pull out in the end and huge for us to get that win
3627787 a galp n o tem capacidadde de interven o na pol tica de pre o mas tem que tentar informar de forma did ctica o cidad o muitas vezes as posi es p blicas contra a galp s o porque os cidad os n o conhecem bem os mecanismos
3627788 it was always my hope that once that audit was completed it would demonstrate that our office is not acting as recklessly if you will as the miami herald might suggest
3627789 however for free services such as googles search engine or other web content providers advertising is their lifeblood and consumers and congress should expect as much information tracking to take place as the portals can both devise and get away with
3627790 otherwise we would go into a depression like we did in the 1930s
3627791 the authorities came to rely on the markets to right themselves they ought to have known better because they have in the past come to the rescue so they ought to have known that the markets dont necessarily right themselves
3627792 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3627793 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3627794 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3627795 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3627796 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3627797 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3627798 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3627799 where did this word suddenly come from why am i thinking this
3627800 well maybe i heard the sahaja people using the word
3627801 we live in a dangerous world we never know whats around the corner
3627802 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate who has not
3627803 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not between one candidate whos a talker and the other candidate whos the leader america needs
3627804 not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3627805 its time to hear the roar of a strong american economy again
3627806 im going to tell them i think they are the heartland of america that the values they hold dear are the strength and character of america
3627807 theyre the reason why the people in georgia today are looking to america a beacon of hope and liberty
3627808 i think were going to be up late on election night
3627809 theres going to be two maybe three vacancies on the supreme court according to people that decide these things
3627810 its not an accident that there has not been another attack on the united states of america
3627811 for that we owe a debt of gratitude to tom ridge
3627812 shes managed to come up with a fragrance thats quite delightful
3627813 i used to love to watch my grandmother put on her perfume
3627814 shed blot a little dab behind her ears it was such a classy ritual
3627815 these fragrances are more than doubling in volume while the market is declining
3627816 they are doing a good job at attracting the trendsetter customer who is looking to try out different things
3627817 there is a real passionate person out there who buys a lot of fragrances and knows when everything is out before it actually comes out
3627818 i have an overly sensitive nose and i dont like most scents
3627819 but this i really like its light it smells fresh its like it belongs on me
3627820 she had a very precise idea about the notes in her perfume
3627821 the fragrance she asked me to make was in a completely different range of my usual creations
3627822 i always wanted to do something on my own but i didnt believe that this passion would become a business
3627823 can or should entheogens be used by one who seriously walks the yoga path
3627824 what benefit might they have for the serious student of yoga
3627825 how has the yoga spiritual communitys changed towards entheogens since the 60s and now and why
3627826 in 1967 when i first came to india i brought with me a supply of lsd hoping to find someone who might understand more about these substances than we did in the west
3627827 did you give me medicine when you were in india last time
3627828 these medicines were used in kulu valley long ago but yogis have lost that knowledge they were used with fasting nobody knows now to take them with no effect your mind must be firmly fixed on god others would be afraid to take many saints would not take this
3627829 it should not be taken in a hot climate if you are in a place that is cool and peaceful and you are alone and your mind is turned toward god then you may take the yogi medicine
3627830 we try to expose these young people to as many positive experiences as possible anything that will help them succeed in college
3627831 we provide the opportunities but theyre the ones who have to put in the work
3627832 it was like immaculate thats one of my new words i like to use
3627833 these kids have excellent coping skills for the streets of chester unfortunately theyre not always transferable
3627834 the idea is not to be ashamed of you who are but to have options
3627835 she was obviously very bright and both her parents were working and living at home she defied all the stereotypes and yet her ignorance was appalling it was not her fault but a criminal failure of the system of education
3627836 not a lot of people from chester high graduate they fall out after 10th grade i can give hope for little kids be a role model i can change the world by being one person
3627837 before i wasnt even sure i wanted to go to college
3627838 but now i have a direction and feel prepared its also helped me realize my leadership potential how i can influence my peers
3627839 these guys were totally out of control they were worse than any thugs that ive seen
3627840 it was like back in the civil rights movement in the 1960s when martin luther king jr was marching women and children were maced and beaten kids are crying and these cops were laughing
3627841 they get the guns off the street they get the drugs off the street they are out there aggressively fighting crime and youre going to have complaints police officers have a right to use force youre dealing with people who dont want to be arrested
3627842 some of the allegations seem very serious and we want to take a thorough look at the matter and determined what went on
3627843 every time he heard a police siren he just screamed and screamed and screamed and said wheres my dad
3627844 ho de anexetastos bios ou bi tos anthr p i
3627845 i can do this fuck it this is what i want
3627846 you throw my fuckin poetry out and youll regret it when im famous
3627847 the money is being spent to improve the overall operations of the school and for the future of the school and it is being spent appropriately
3627848 ultimately we would like to see and im sure renaissance would like to see that money go into their program
3627849 but if theyre shut down they wont have a program for it to go into
3627850 this is costing people a lot of time money and heartache
3627851 its our responsibility to gather all the information thats available to us to determine whether our initial decision to not to renew should be sustained
3627852 thats really our responsibility im looking at this from our position as the school reform commission
3627853 when youre placed in a situation by the school district where you are under attack and your charter is not being renewed based on what we think is faulty data you have no choice but to defend the school
3627854 they need to defend themselves against some of the accusations that have been made
3627855 if you look at some of the studies renaissances academics are as good if not better than some charter schools that were renewed without question
3627856 the renaissance charter is not looking for this whole issue to go away
3627857 they understand they need corrective action and they are taking steps towards that
3627858 the independence and effectiveness of external audits in new jersey cannot be trusted unless changes are made
3627859 auditors probably shouldnt be in the business of writing checks in campaign season
3627860 these are professionals and we feel they do a very very good job
3627861 you need to have an auditor who is independent and has the right incentives to scrutinize the units books and records and not an audit firm thats focused purely on maintaining the contractual relationship for as long a term as possible
3627862 it probably is a good idea to have a new set of eyes looking at your books
3627863 he was born in the summer of his 27th year coming home to a place hed never been before
3627864 ah this is exactly what ive been looking for all of these years
3627865 hes on third base but so far he cant seem to find a way to get home
3627866 look at the underlying trends the economy is a huge issue bushs ratings are terrible but too many voters are concerned about obamas experience and dont yet have enough confidence in his ability to lead
3627867 no ones figured out how race affects this election but you cannot rule out race as a problem for some voters
3627868 obamas hurdles with voters are questions about his experience some policy differences and the feeling among some that he may be too liberal
3627869 the story of this fall campaign will be whether voters can get comfortable enough with him to trust him to lead the nation it really is about barack obama
3627870 my nakshatra is citra this is the most mystical of signs overcoming sexual desire is a big thing or can be
3627871 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3627872 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3627873 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3627874 what do you want to be when you grow up
3627875 theres a stereotype that students from east l a dont want to finish high school and it was a chance to show everyone that we do want to go to college
3627876 we need more to be done we cannot let this lack of effective implementation continue
3627877 instead of things moving forward they seemed to have moved back hes probably going to have to do the same things i did
3627878 the students were saying set higher expectations for us and ill meet them
3627879 it was a huge deal probably one of the most important policy shifts in the district
3627880 both of these men care about america my job is to let them share their views
3627881 america has a choice its not between a stud and a dud this year
3627882 both of these men care about america my job is to let them share their views
3627883 america has a choice its not between a stud and a dud this year
3627884 both of these men care about america my job is to let them share their views
3627885 hes a guy whose message has met the right moment
3627886 you know that i never endorse nor campaign for political candidates neither is it my role to give political advice but i am a cultural observer and i do understand the unique stresses and responsibilities of public leadership so i try to help leaders when asked
3627887 for many evangelical leaders rick warren is either a little too naive or a little too shrewd
3627888 he is threatening to water down the essential message of evangelical christianity
3627889 and that is what causes people to grow a little insecure and concerned and maybe even disconcerted
3627890 this case is about the future of private religious education and the right to be able to have your kids learn from a religious perspective
3627891 has been totally within its legal rights to apply admission standards across the board to all students and has been doing that in an appropriate way
3627892 no one is questioning the right of calvary chapel to teach what they want to teach but what the case says is that when you do that there may be consequences
3627893 continued a long line of cases where challenges to the teaching of evolution have been essentially pushed back
3627894 there must have been an absence of checks and balances for this to occur
3627895 but there should be systems in place so they dont have such a dramatic effect on the departments efforts to take on such critical issues
3627896 the employee did not understand the ramifications of what she was doing and truthfully neither did anyone else thats the reality of a bureaucracy one clerk can cause something like this to happen
3627897 to the bureaucrat a thousand dollars is a line item to me it is a rape victim who wont know the identity of their attacker
3627898 this problem could have been averted by making dna testing a priority for the last several years the department needs to understand that scientists are just as important as officers
3627899 my father was like you know what just let them do what they want if thats gonna get the kids to stop tagging
3627900 there were no licensing requirements in pennsylvania for mortgage referral agencies so people could run around and do whatever they want
3627901 this will cause mortgage referral agents to think twice before encouraging people to accept a predatory loan
3627902 unfortunately this ordinance was not crafted with countywide consensus nor does it provide an acceptable standard of long term equity for all regions of los angeles county which will be paying this new sales tax
3627903 cr ticos s o como eunucos em um har m sabem como faz v em outros fazendo mas n o sabem fazer
3627904 quentin est convencido que britney ser brilhante no filme ela est muito contente ela acha que isso poderia transformar sua carreira
3627905 they like to trot out pro choice moderates to show theyre open minded but when it comes right down to it they dont pick people like tom ridge
3627906 the day he drove down to washington in 1999 to tell his friend john mccain he was supporting governor bush for president
3627907 their window was open up there and i heard a lot of cussing
3627908 they used to sit on their porch all the time i actually just seen them together their little kid was running around
3627909 i saw police take several young girls out of the house this morning
3627910 they took one person in an ambulance and another one in a black suv
3627911 this is unfortunately one of the most insane obscene and disgusting things ive heard in all my public life
3627912 i can assure you that should we be successful in our defense we will go after them for every dime the taxpayers have to spend
3627913 disqualified as a result of a civil abandonment claim the proceeds if any after a jury trial would flow by pennsylvania law to the brothers and sisters of danieal kelly most of whom are impoverished children in foster care
3627914 in light of the criminal indictments which were returned against the parents
3627915 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3627916 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3627917 experiences from the flow 12 farang square peg round hole compatibility issues
3627918 experiences from the flow 11 farangs are you in or considering a long term western asian relationship read this now
3627919 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3627920 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3627921 what do you want to be when you grow up
3627922 we started out by offering free breakfasts and saw an increasing number of people coming through the doors of our centre
3627923 then sainsburys stepped in offering tinned goods and they have been taken up very eagerly
3627924 it seems as more and more people are experiencing financial problems they are turning to us
3627925 it partially about the benefits system as well as people change say from sickness benefit to unemployment benefit then they make experience a period when they have no money coming in
3627926 so they are coming to us for help which we are only too pleased to offer
3627927 we are very pleased to put food that may be wasted back into the community and when times are hard we want to help
3627928 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3627929 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3627930 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3627931 everyone knows the next one could be ukraine and then poland all of europe should be here now
3627932 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3627933 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3627934 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3627935 we have at least the core number of people to go forward
3627936 it was predictable that this was going to become a catastrophic problem in our community
3627937 i was busy in georgia but this is sort of a new level of trauma care
3627938 i think the bottom line is we lost focus we did and that focus is coming back
3627939 i think fundamentally our service is sound it doesnt mean were perfect and we certainly have work to do things to fix fences to mend
3627940 all parties to the conflict must abstain from direct attacks on civilians their operations must also avoid attacks which do not attempt to distinguish between military and non military targets we are concerned that some of the attacks mounted in south ossetia could amount to war crimes
3627941 never to be angry because the archives of the hard disk have been deleted in the office

3627944 we hope that the long overdue release of dr dalilah is followed by the release of all other prisoners of conscience in syria
3627945 i am thankful for all the efforts made by everyone at amnesty international and all those who took part in actions on my behalf we are united in the struggle for the causes of justice and democracy this struggle is still ongoing
3627946 irresistible new forces are reshaping the world of selling sales functions everywhere are in the early stages of radical and profound comparable to those that began in manufacturing 20 years ago but one change outweighs all the others the meaning of selling itself is shifting the very purpose of sales is being rapidly redefined
3627947 ing continues to weather the turmoil in credit markets well as writedowns on pressurised assets remained limited in the second quarter we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3627948 we took advantage of the brief market rally in april to reduce our equity exposure nonetheless equity gains net of impairments were significantly below the exceptional levels realised last year combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline interest income in the banking business rose strongly despite competition for deposits risk costs increased but remained below over the cycle norms costs remained under control in mature markets while we continued to invest to support growth
3627949 all capital and leverage ratios are well within target the group has eur 3 9 billion of spare leverage capacity after the completion of ings eur 5 billion share buyback and the payment of last years final dividend in the second quarter in line with our policy to pay an interim dividend equal to half of the previous years total dividend our interim dividend has been set at eur 0 74 per share to be paid fully in cash
3627950 ing maintained its commercial growth in these challenging market circumstances the net new production of client balances was eur 29 6 billion in the quarter bringing the total to eur 1 482 billion growth was driven by a large increase in lending particularly at the wholesale bank in retail banking and ing direct we continued to grow savings despite strong competition for deposits sales of life insurance were up 8 8 excluding currency impacts as product innovation and expanded distribution helped compensate for lower demand for unit linked products
3627951 financial services companies are facing unprecedented market volatility limited liquidity and intensified competition for deposits which we see continuing into 2009 we are executing our strategy in the context of this challenging environment by focussing on growing client balances while keeping a close eye on margins and expenses we continue to adapt our product range to meet our customers changing needs while investing to expand our distribution in growth markets in mature markets we are on track with the transformation projects at our retail banking businesses in the benelux and expense reductions at the dutch insurance business are now evident as markets remain volatile we will continue to manage our risk and capital with discipline while financial markets are expected to put pressure on results in the short term we are confident that ing will continue to create profitable growth for our shareholders over the long term through the breadth of our business and the strength of our franchise
3627952 with preliminary exploration work yielding positive results we are eager to proceed to the next phase of exploration
3627953 we are currently in positive discussions with institutional investors and private accredited investors outside of the united states some of the interested parties may require the company co list on the tsx venture exchange
3627954 the feasibility study confirms our belief that rasuhuilca provides an excellent opportunity for rapid mine development and will serve as an additional profit stream to augment revenues expected to commence at the end of the year from our quintana gold mine development in colombia whilst being a relatively small mine in size having a plant in this area offers cmr tremendous opportunities for additional deals and further mine development
3627955 you have to be able to deliver a game in six weeks sometimes quicker we can do that
3627956 but typical game development doesnt work like that you start with an idea and then build it until its finished if that happens to be five weeks great but more often than not its a lot more
3627957 the thing that kills most other developers as well is wastage they spend a lot of time on things that either never get seen or never get used but because we have a process thats been scaled to fit the time available the wastage is minimal sometimes there isnt any at all

3627963 one hawk landed safely at 11 40am and the other has returned to williamtown near newcastle
3627964 the aircraft was circling over the ocean to receive a standard damage check from the other hawk pilot the spokesman said
3627965 while circulating the aircraft was also burning off fuel to reduce its landing weight

3627997 we have had a look at the alternative sites suggested by the council and to achieve the same coverage and capacity we would need two masts
3627998 it would probably upset a lot more people to have two new masts and we would prefer that the mast stays where it is
3627999 i have offered to do an independent radio frequency test so local residents can see how low the emissions are they are hundreds of times lower than for a mobile phone handset
3628000 as far as we are concerned the mast is in an excellent position for coverage and capacity now and in the future as more people use their phones
3628001 discussions between ourselves and o2 are continuing and as far as we are concerned a final position has not been reached and our dialogue will continue until it has
3628002 the last assessment ended up being the death knell of the first scheme because it showed the scheme was not sustainable in terms of the local roads
3628003 we really want to see what the story is this time
3628004 we found the consultants report unintelligible and we are calling for a meeting with the county officers for a full explanation
3628005 there needs to be an independent and comprehensive transport assessment of the impact of this development by cambridgeshire county council
3628006 for the county council to just comment on ashwells own assessment of what the developers think the traffic impact will be is simply not good enough
3628007 we have been through their transport assessment and broadly speaking we are satisfied with what they are saying

3628021 they have a different approach to wine beer and spirits than other generations
3628022 in this generation there is an acceptability of wine as the alcohol of choice and they drink for drinkings sake for pleasure and conviviality less in concert with foods and eating
3628023 they are drinking wine completely different than the previous generation
3628024 they are fearless they are the imac generation they click and try something new if they dont like that they click and try something else
3628025 they just want to try something taste it and if its good post it to a friend they learn from their tribe not the so called wine critics
3628026 we have found that 21 percent of people who drink wine regularly are in that age group

3628039 i want to offer a very sincere and heartfelt apology to those that have suffered from the profiling that has been done
3628040 i want to apologize to those citizens who feel they havent received equal treatment or protection
3628041 we need to not only enforce the law we need to have equal treatment and equal enforcement
3628042 i dont want it to get to the point where our officers are fearful to go into those communities and fear theyre going to get retaliation from the council and everybody else who seem to think these officers are doing something wrong
3628043 we have a problem here so we need to figure out a solution to the problem
3628044 the genetics of the turkeys we sell can be traced back to the early 1800s
3628045 they come as close to resembling the ones the pilgrims ate as you can find
3628046 if you look at apparel and tv and furniture and toys and games they were all down and down quite sharply
3628047 the only reason imports didnt plunge this month was because of pharmaceuticals
3628048 which were way up but can be very volatile from one month to the next
3628049 its very good news that exports have been doing so well
3628050 we dont want to imagine how bad things would be if they hadnt been
3628051 it sends a message that everything is fine here and everything is not fine here
3628052 i felt it was going to be a distraction on top of everything else were working so hard on

3628057 actually having it out in the wild and people banging on it and using it in different locations and monitoring the hardware and software was really important
3628058 there was a huge amount of investment and attention to detail in getting it more polished and wrapped before we released it externally
3628059 its a little bit of a departure from other pc interaction models and game console models
3628060 theres obviously a lot of smart people around here who have great ideas in both user experiences but also new kinds of applications that can be launched on it
3628061 you really wouldnt think about doing this kind of application unless you had the touch technology
3628062 i think we bought one to put in either my foundation office or the other place ill have an office
3628063 its not a large enough expenditure that people will pass up on it just because of the slower economy for people who havent lost a job its still an inexpensive option
3628064 historically in tougher times people stay home and we get a bump
3628065 the fair is the single best value in northern california
3628066 there are lots of things to do from one end of the grounds to the other without having to spend a dime
3628067 we normally go on a really nice trip to europe
3628068 the economy is not going to affect our annual visits
3628069 i dont believe weve missed a year in the last 25 years
3628070 weve markedly increased the number of non north american participants so the recommendations are more international the process of evaluation has improved much more rigorous with panelists for each chapter developing questions sent out to an evidenced based center which then performed a literature search tables of all the clinical trials that have been done for every single clinical condition are included the review process has changed too with each chapter and the manuscript as a whole reviewed by two independent people
3628071 if someone has had an issue with hit and requires bypass surgery what do you use as anticoagulation during bypass
3628072 its safe to use heparin for bypass surgery because it is only used short term and is cleared very quickly physicians are uncomfortable with this because of medicolegal implications but it is perfectly rational
3628073 and if you did this elisa test on all patients after bypass surgery 20 to 30 would be positive it creates almost as much harm as good
3628074 when there is good evidence that it works often its not been given because people just dont think about it
3628075 more and more randomized clinical trials that have been published that demonstrate the benefits of computer assisted international normalized ratio inr monitoring for warfarin therapy showing it is superior to physician monitoring with various nomograms for dose adjustment being more effective than decisions made off the cuff
3628076 care for children with major cardiac problems has improved dramatically
3628077 but thrombosis remains a major cause of secondary complications for these children so effective antithrombotic therapy is critical
3628078 it was a great opportunity for our old and new families to get together
3628079 the group has been running for about 28 years and has supported parents and carers of children with special needs
3628080 we provide a real break for the parents as their children play with experienced volunteers and have an information service
3628081 if schools usually use these marks as a performance indicator but dont trust the results this year they might make students take an additional examination and teachers would have to do more work
3628082 we would be very uncomfortable with that and if there are concerns about marks it should not be classroom teachers who have to analyse data because that is not part of their job
3628083 the school has now received our students key stage 3 sats results
3628084 after an initial inspection of the papers the school will ask for a review of english and there is the possibility of a review in science we feel the maths results reflect the progress made by the students
3628085 for a time it seemed like it was a slam dunk if you were gay from mexico and filed for asylum in the united states
3628086 but theres been a turning point the gay rights movement has started to make progress in mexico and its a little harder to show
3628087 people think the homophobia is under control which is not true
3628088 it is a crime for people with access to antiretrovirals to continue to die from tb
3628089 i gnoring tb screening and care undermines all the gains made in hiv treatment
3628090 the virus is not that clever we can overcome but it works on our ignorance both political ignorance economic ignorance and personal ignorance
3628091 may sound frivolous but little else has proven effective for the men most affected by the epidemic
3628092 committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
3628093 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
3628094 a very easy population to fund its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
3628095 its troubling they are getting into care late and not getting diagnosed as early and we need to pay attention to that
3628096 our study suggests doctors should think twice before using enoxaparin or intravenous heparin for that matter to bridge anticoagulation therapy with warfarin in patients with cardioembolic stroke
3628097 we found that all of the hemorrhage cases were in one group those who were bridged with enoxaparin
3628098 when you think about it this is really not surprising because the good thing as well as the bad thing about this drug is that it does exactly what it is supposed to do it fully anticoagulates
3628099 we believe the infarct damages the small and medium sized vessels which are later reperfused and tend to leak blood but the difference between this patient group and patients with other types of stroke is that those with cardioembolic stroke get anticoagulated really quickly which promotes bleeding
3628100 he is a young man who has learned his lesson in a very hard way
3628101 what is more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose
3628102 would force firms to spend money to automate their systems and would add costs to both brokers and customers in the form of increased borrowers fees
3628103 in this time of economic uncertainty that would not be a popular outcome for wall street
3628104 we want to have all the facts out there so we can get the public in sacramento thinking about whether this is the direction we want to go
3628105 do we want to build big road projects like we did in the 1950s or do we really change our region
3628106 it is going to take some time a year to a year and a half
3628107 caltrans still believes that has tremendous benefits for mobility in the region
3628108 this should quiet some of the more misguided critics who have been claiming the california environmental quality act did not require analysis of greenhouse gas impacts
3628109 were very strict on firearms but it seems anything goes with ammunition
3628110 dangerous weapons should be out of the hands of dangerous people
3628111 were likely to hit bottom for the housing market in the next few months
3628112 were starting to see some pickup because of the steep price declines that will help in places like florida california and nevada
3628113 were also starting to see illegal contractors get more aggressive
3628114 this is becoming a bigger problem since the construction industry went down
3628115 he was 70 feet away when i first saw him
3628116 he was coal black a very large male i would say in the 400 pound bracket he turned and all i saw then was a massive head with about seven inches between the eyes
3628117 as soon as i hit the bear with the light it did a 10 pace lunge toward me i snapped in a clip the bear continued to charge and i aimed one inch below the eyes and shot it from about 18 to 20 feet
3628118 he made some hellacious squeals made about three swooping turns then took off down a fire road going fast
3628119 i talked with him right after the shooting and he didnt say anything about the bear charging
3628120 he said he took his gun and flashlight and chased it down to a meadow area and when it turned its head he shot it in the head
3628121 i know something like this is tragic to some people
3628122 but i didnt hide the bear i was the one who reported it if i had buried it i certainly wouldnt have called the police and gone through all this hell
3628123 theres a possibility hes still in there or crawling around somewhere else
3628124 head wounds bleed profusely and bears have pretty thick skulls
3628125 my guess is theres no danger if it was a grazing wound and its gone back where it came from
3628126 fish and game is looking into shooting a bear out of season and whether it was self defense
3628127 its really a validation of where weve been able to take our wireless operations
3628128 im surprised all of sacramento was not awakened by my husband and his 24 years of leftover adrenaline exploding through his gills
3628129 my image of that moment jeff in the flesh on my left and michael in high definition on my right both simultaneously shot their flippers to the rafters blow holes blaring to beat the band do at home olympics get any better
3628130 it was a magic carpet ride such an emotional high
3628131 you spend years trying to find another passion that turns you on
3628132 my name is float what are you going to do
3628133 weve hung eight of my speedos from my swimming days
3628134 our labor market isnt as ideal as it was a year ago
3628135 things arent great here but i think theyre still somewhat better than the nation as a whole
3628136 my instinct is that it probably will get worse before it gets better
3628137 but i dont know if it will get a lot worse
3628138 within japan there are little excesses in employment capacity and corporate leverage
3628139 we do not see elements in the economy that would push the japanese economy into a deeper recession
3628140 we continue to evaluate our liquidity and our alternatives to improve the balance sheet
3628141 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3628142 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
3628143 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
3628144 what we really need to do is tell people that were back in the car business
3628145 we have a real opportunity on our hand over the next couple of years to show people that we have world class cars that were bringing here to the u s
3628146 was committed after the onset of the current credit crisis
3628147 were still going to see food price inflation but it could have been much much worse had we not had the almost perfect weather since the middle of june
3628148 the first few crop reports of the year are guesses
3628149 this one gives you the first solid idea of what the crop really looks like
3628150 ive been farming for 33 years and this was probably one of the hardest springs ive had putting a crop in
3628151 i just planted it wet and hoped mother nature would keep sending the rain to get it up
3628152 now we have the double benefit of not paying higher prices for flour and having a better more efficient operation in place
3628153 even if corn is cheaper today than it has been recently its still very expensive by historic standards you cant make an easy argument that because corn is down 3 then food prices are coming down
3628154 we hope that it was just the beginning of a continuing dialogue as we move toward a final rfp that prescribes the right aircraft and gives appropriate weight to all of the capabilities that will be required for the evolving mission over the next several decades
3628155 our hope and our belief is that this can be done in a profitable way that works for even large institutions

3628164 i am really impressed by the organisation of fc twente
3628165 i see people who are working for the club with passion and want to go further
3628166 on the pitch i found a group with a very good fitness level so we could immediately work on the performance
3628167 the target was immediately pointed on the future looking back to last season is useless that was the first thing i made clear to the squad you cannot live on the success you had before
3628168 we want to go on down the line that brought success before and that is what we are working on now
3628169 how fc twente will get on without rutten is an unknown
3628170 our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that treatment of hypertension has had a profound effect on outcome at the community level
3628171 together these observations support the hypothesis that the widespread introduction and adoption of antihypertensive therapy has altered the natural history of bp progression and the relations of bp to outcome in the community
3628172 and not by its long term trend in the past
3628173 none of the bp variables predicted all cause mortality in the later period
3628174 suggests that all cause mortality might not be the best choice of a primary end point in future treatment trials in patients with hypertension
3628175 our findings underscore the opportunity to improve public health by applying existing recommendations for treatment of hypertension this may be especially true in europe and other regions of the world where bp control rates lag behind those in the us
3628176 we are very good at opening arteries that are blocked but we have not succeeded in preventing heart attacks related to plaque rupture
3628177 the kind of plaques we are treating in secritt do not cause symptoms or seriously affect blood flow but they are prone to rupture which can cause a clot or thrombus
3628178 gt highlights from antiplatelet therapy for percutaneous coronary intervention optimal management of individual patients requires the clinician to have a clear understanding of both the mechanisms and challenges of treatment drs badimon kristensen spaulding and storeys presentations reflect that while current guidelines recommend that patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes or patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention should be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy that is they should receive aspirin and a thienopyridine often patients are undertreated in both in hospital and on discharge drs harvey white and christian hamm in a discussion of a clinical case of a patient that has developed resistance
3628179 gt optimising outcomes in acute coronary syndromes role of new approaches to platelet inhibition 5 comments jun 3 2008 14 22 edt balancing antithrombotic efficacy with risk of bleeding join our international panel of experts
3628180 the basic message here is that 6 to 8 of elective pci patients have unrecognized acs when they walk in the door probably an indicator of vulnerable plaque and this is associated with a doubling of both periprocedural events and long term mortality risk
3628181 these are patients who are having a heart attack even as they walk in the door for their elective angioplasty or maybe they are patients who are having small heart attacks all the time
3628182 that was a completely new finding that we had never seen before probably because nobody has ever looked so thats interesting in and of itself but its really most interesting because when we looked at those 6 of patients compared with the other 94 they had a much higher risk of complications of angioplasty meaning death or mi during the initial hospitalization in the short run as well as a substantial increased risk over the year of follow up
3628183 there are several reasons why one could argue that you dont necessarily need to do the troponin
3628184 the most compelling is that we dont know what to do differently with that information in the acs setting its been nicely shown that using gp iib iiia inhibitors confer benefit whether youre willing to make the leap from the acs setting to the elective setting is a matter of opinion at this stage we simply do not have any evidence and no one has ever looked
3628185 in parallel with that i would love to see tests either of gp iib iiia inhibitors or other new antithrombotic regimens in this population

3628190 this paper is the first to show the associations of alcohol consumption with mortality from total stroke stroke subtypes coronary heart disease and total cardiovascular disease among asian men and women
3628191 we expected to find an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke
3628192 but since alcohol reduces the ability of the blood to clot we didnt expect to find the increases in ischemic stroke and coronary heart disease
3628193 in women we found a slightly reduced risk with light consumption but a much greater risk with heavy alcohol use
3628194 although a few studies have reported the association between moderate to heavy alcohol consumption and stroke and coronary heart disease among western women such evidence is limited for women in asian countries probably due to the low prevalence of drinkers and coronary heart disease
3628195 one limitation of the study is that in japanese culture there are social restrictions against women drinking as they get older
3628196 in that culture the women who do drink may have different types of jobs or other aspects of their lifestyle that may help explain the excess risk as well as the alcohol exposure itself
3628197 an amount of alcohol that may be beneficial for men is not good for women at all

3628206 when you dont have the ablation technique you find all sorts of reasons for not doing it but the ones who are trained to use ablation use it as front line therapy with drugs as adjuvants
3628207 i know you are a fantastic ablater andrea but im not sure of your debating skills
3628208 there are many arguments against ablation as a first line therapy we have five trials that pretend to show us that using ablation would be better but they are all miserably small have short follow up and lack hard outcomes and lets not forget the complications in a worldwide survey mortality was 0 5 with ablation and serious adverse reactions occurred in 5 to 6 of patients
3628209 is this really compatible with the notion than you should treat af first line with ablation
3628210 are those older than 75 who are asymptomatic and have no problem taking warfarin
3628211 but what we can say with reasonable comfort is that we certainly know that ablation makes people feel better
3628212 for example in the uk we have more than 200 000 cases of af every year in a population of 59 million but we only have 40 ablation centers performing two procedures a week so this equates to only 4000 procedures per year
3628213 instead of pennies for beta blockers we see from the only decent study done that cost per life year saved is 98 000
3628214 we need better trials we have to do trials like athena with the antiarrhythmic dronedarone this antiarrhythmic drug saves lives this antiarrhythmic drug prevents hospitalizations where are the data that your procedure does this we will get there but we are not there yet
3628215 the guidelines are quite explicit that we should try antiarrhythmic drugs first and if they dont work we can try ablation antiarrhythmics are tried and tested
3628216 no because the goal for catheter ablation should be to remove drug therapy but i might move this drug higher on my list of first line options
3628217 the real big question is whether ablation will affect hard end points like stroke and heart failure and therefore reduce mortality
3628218 af ablation does not have any controlled trials to show that it improves outcomes
3628219 since we have about 75 success with this whereas its only around 60 in persistent af
3628220 it may be that one day catheter ablation can interrupt the natural history of af
3628221 a lot of excitement about focused ultrasound cryo and laser balloons as well as magnetic and robotic guided catheter control systems
3628222 that it remains to be seen precisely where all of these will all fit
3628223 we never stop warfarin following ablation in patients considered at high risk of stroke we dont yet have the evidence to do that
3628224 but he said not all ablaters agree with this and if this trial can show that ablation could provide an alternative for patients who cant take warfarin because of bleeding risks that would be fantastic he noted
3628225 camm added that besides the long list of complications there is no full study of ablation as a first line strategy and no agreement on the best technique camm cited a plethora of reasons why ablation should not be considered first line therapy for af any time soon first he described the high prevalence and annual incidence of af the very limited availability of ablation services and the learning curve for the procedure
3628226 it remains increasingly critical that the practicing physician acquire and maintain an understanding of relevant first principles of electrophysiology although it is exciting it should be kept in mind that the technology facilitates the application of those fundamental principles of electrophysiology only for the benefit of arrhythmia patients

3628228 ten years ago we reported a high incidence of mortality in this patient population the major change and the good news is that mortality from pregnancy related mi which was between 20 and 30 has been reduced now to around 5 to 10
3628229 its extremely important that physicians who take care of women during pregnancy and after delivery be aware of the occasional occurrence of acute mi in pregnancy and not overlook symptoms in these young patients
3628230 last time we pointed out the fact that some cases of pregnancy related mi were diagnosed late and the awareness of the possibility of having acute mi at such a young age was not very high also because of the pregnancy any treatment of mi was not that effective because of concerns and a lack of experience people had in treating mi in pregnancy
3628231 a higher number of patients are having angiography so we have learned more about the mechanisms of acute mi in pregnancy
3628232 in almost 30 of cases they had coronary dissection the incidence of which is multiple fold higher than in nonpregnant women others just had clots and no atherosclerotic disease
3628233 one thing we have learned is that when a women presents with acute mi in pregnancy particularly around the time of or just after delivery you need to suspect an unusual cause of mi and try to define the mechanism
3628234 extremely small and should probably be considered safe for use when necessary
3628235 we felt it was important to reexamine the literature about acute mi related to pregnancy and provide updated recommendations for the diagnosis and management of heart attack in this group of women its been encouraging to see improvement in patient outcomes over the past 10 years and we hope the guidelines presented in this paper will further increase awareness about acute mi in pregnancy
3628236 the message is that young women can have heart disease and mi its rare you dont see it a lot but people need to recognize the fact that this needs to be included in a differential diagnosis

3628249 ok i accept the fact that slaughtering my wife in front of my kids wasnt really right but to handcuff me for it to take me to court and send a tv crew dont you think youre overdoing it a little
3628250 and we do have that evidence for risk factor screening
3628251 even though people criticize risk factor assessment because it is not sensitive enough or not accurate enough the interesting and curious thing is that we actually have evidence that if you go to the trouble of screening for risk factors and treating them patients have better outcomes we do not have that evidence for any of these other tests
3628252 theyre saying that we cant identify disease very effectively so lets just stick with risk factors which we know are very poorly predictive and nonspecific it boggles my mind as to why they wont open up their minds to the importance of moving forward in finding better strategies to identify the disease that we are treating its very strange they criticize these disease markers because they are not predictive of events but they are looking at very short term outcomes were interested in lifetime risk were screening people in their 40s who are concerned about morbid events in their 60s and 70s and no trials are going to track them that long
3628253 you have to accept the pathophysiologic reality that heart attacks dont occur in the absence of coronary disease and coronary disease doesnt occur in the absence of endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease all of which now can be identified
3628254 were just saying can we as a society and as a profession accept the idea that there is a link between the vascular abnormalities and the events
3628255 and that that linkage is tight enough that it should allow us to accept slowing of progression of the vascular abnormalities as an adequate marker for slowing disease progression without waiting for events to occur as soon as you use the word surrogate people jump up and say we have all these markers that we know dont work well things like premature ventricular contractions pvcs on the electrocardiogram ldl hdl but those are not the markers were talking about were talking about structural and functional changes in the blood vessel and in the heart
3628256 theres so much that needs to be done in terms of evaluating this greenland and lloyd jones instead of conceding that what were claiming is exceedingly rational and that we now really need to investigate this in the most effective way we can theyre essentially saying no this isnt important lets go back to risk factors which is really foolish
3628257 thats not to say that these technologies are poor for certain uses but we think that theyre untested in a screening situation
3628258 but i can tell you it has major problems too
3628259 thats a perfect example of how people who are on the screening bandwagon have sort of missed the point
3628260 russert actually had multiple tests that were abnormal including a coronary calcium test but he had an exercise test that was normal so there is an example where you have discrepancies between two test results and what do you do
3628261 the response i get veers widely between people who are fascinated and say oh my god thats the way to do this and those who are highly critical and immediately say we already measure blood pressure and nothing more to do here and i would disagree
3628262 this area has definitely polarized the cardiology community and its rather interesting in my view how this has happened because its not always the case that the most invasive cardiologists are in favor of screening there are many many people on the invasive side who say wait a second this is bad so i think the only way that this issue is going to get resolved is not by editorials or opinions like mine or jay cohns but by more data and the data that are needed are clinical trials
3628263 theyre not really embracing the idea that yes this is a wonderful idea thats go out and prove it i think their view represents that of the aha which has aggressively focused on risk factor identification and treatment that approach is outmoded this whole research agenda will take us years to work through but the sooner we start it the sooner we can achieve a more effective preventive strategy
3628264 there are those like drs cohn and duprez and others who feel that the new test options are sufficiently mature to justify their routine application there are many others and i am one of them who feel that screening unselected people or even a moderately targeted group of people requires evidence and careful analysis which to date we do not have for any of the new tests including coronary artery calcium and carotid imt etc
3628265 acting without evidence is not necessarily unhealthy but certainly can be wrong
3628266 we have no evidence based medicine that supports mass screening of asymptomatic individuals as being cost effective
3628267 do not complain of hunger when your mouth is full
3628268 if we were doing our jobs in primary prevention we would not need to look at improved intervention and secondary prevention to reduce coronary death

3628376 yes you do how many gave their lives to christ
3628377 youd know by reading that bible sitting on your end table none jason none theres not a record of a single one following christ after that fish dinner the story says jesus sent them away and he sent the disciples out to sea and he drew apart to pray

3628405 the aftermath of 9 11 in new york was something i felt an important need to document
3628406 this project started when i went to a women in agriculture meeting advertised in the athens news when i was in grad school i decided to localize the story of women in agriculture or women owned farms by focusing on farms in southeast ohio this was during a documentary class taught by bruce strong a wonderful professor who challenged much of my thinking during the class i found linda fagan the mother of the family with the help of a woman who was at this meeting upon my first visit to the farm i realized that there was more of a story with this family than just the women who worked there i asked if i could continue to photograph them and they agreed i didnt really know what i was photographing as i continued my visits i just knew something drew me to them it was toward the end of my time at ou that i realized what i so admired about this family it was their independence i realized their values and lifestyle was really based upon their own definition of a purpose filled life

3628463 theres much more at stake here than the freedom of a former soviet republic and russias attempt to big foot itself back onto the world stage
3628464 whats really going on is that russia is trying essentially to reconstitute the old soviet union bring back the old spheres of influence if you take over georgia today whats next could they then move into the ukraine sic could they take over the czech republic these are awful options that are on the table but theres a fear that if they start here and are not stopped what happens next

3628475 but there is depreciation of 20 per cent for every year new india assurance company development officer mukesh thakker said on thursday
3628476 the car was apparently used for some smuggling activity and i had to go through a harrowing time as the police questioned me i finally got my car one year later when the police cracked the case he said on thursday
3628477 i dont want this year to be hampering me with injuries and stuff like that so that was the first thought that came into my head but i should be beyond that now
3628478 last year i missed all of training camp and came out and had a pretty good year
3628479 ive been dealing with adversity since ive been in the nfl
3628480 i give him some pointers and my opinion on the whole situation
3628481 we can relate to that definitely we have a good relationship my first year here he kind of has shown me the ropes sheldon brown too were all pretty tight
3628482 you dont know how many reps were going to get
3628483 im anxious to see us play a whole game i think the more time you have together the more comfortable and relaxed you are to play together
3628484 like ive said this is not the time to be talking about whos on the field and whos not on the field were getting ready to go into the season and if were going to go into the season and try to win and seriously be committed to doing it youre going to have to push your ego aside for a year
3628485 i love to compete when im watching film and i see my teammates out there competing and getting after it and making plays something just comes into me makes me want to get out there if my brothers are out there and im not out there its kind of frustrating but im back and feeling good
3628486 definitely i should have made that interception hands down nine times out of 10 i never miss that play but one play doesnt make a game we lost and life goes on you have to move forward
3628487 people can say whatever they want like i said one play doesnt make a game whoever said things im sure they had a couple messed up plays that had an affect on the game

3628491 the fact it that transracial adoptions have increased post mepa although not as much as we might hope but it takes time for laws to have an impact and it is only recently that the federal government began serious implementation efforts issuing its first enforcement decision in 2003 with that decision not upheld on administrative appeal until 2006 in any event there is certainly no reason to think that recreating a barrier to transracial adoption as the donaldson report calls for will do anything other than make it harder to find homes for waiting children
3628492 religious freedom for providers of adoption foster care and child welfare services act
3628493 this is the kind of legislation that this congress is afraid to bring up for fear of offending the gay lobby
3628494 were trying to enlighten peoples understanding of the appreciation for birth mothers
3628495 adoption is a positive option and we view birth mothers as loving responsible parents who made a decision in the best interest of the child the definition of a good parent is someone who does whats best for her child she can feel right about whats shes done see herself as a good mother because she is
3628496 the adoption market exhibits all of the pathologies of price regulation
3628497 first theres a huge supply demand imbalance we have 1 5 million abortions a year but a shortage of babies available for adoption and that suggests something is wrong second theres a black market and a gray market in adoption where doctors and lawyers act as middlemen and collect fees
3628498 but theyre sold in a hidden way if you look at the fees that adoption agencies charge theres no itemized schedule that puts a price on parental rights the people who do de facto profit from selling parental rights are the adoption agencies or adoption lawyers the middlemen precisely because of the artificial scarcity of the thing that they sell
3628499 when a birth mother gives a child up for adoption she legally transfers her parental rights to the adoptive parents the adoptive parents gain all those rights but only those rights that the birth mother possessed before the adoption such rights are those that all non derelict parents have in their children the rights do not include license to abuse the child or to use him or her as a slave branding the sale of parental rights baby selling provokes people reflexively but wrongly to assume that some horror akin to slavery is being advocated
3628500 the onjections are for the most part aesthetic it strikes people as unseemly but they dont stop and think through the ramifications
3628501 we allow parents who desperately want children to have them and the mother profits from transferring her rights
3628502 regardless of how you feel about the morality of abortion and im not pro abortion its hard to argue that the child is worse off i dont see who loses out on that deal and women have better incentives to take care of themselves prenatally parents who contract for adoptions are not going into it willy nilly and there will be mechanisms to monitor the health of the child so women will have an incentive not to drink or use drugs while pregnant
3628503 id also like to see a way of properly categorising games whats the most downloaded game at the moment whats been most bought

3628553 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3628554 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3628555 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3628556 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3628557 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3628558 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3628559 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3628560 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great

3628565 the thing is were on the warped tour now and weve never played warped before and were not like a typical warped band but i guess a lot of kids asked us to be there
3628566 so were playing the mosh set on warped because we want to make sure the kids get to beat the sh out of each other because we know thats what they like to do
3628567 when you think warped you dont think of a band like us
3628568 we wear a lot of bright clothes we shake our butts a lot were very sarcastic were electronic usually warped is about the mosh but the truth is the scene is changing a lot these days and what unites all the bands on warped isnt a specific musical sound but its more of an ethic there are so many different types of bands on warped i cant tell you how surprised i am to have made friends with some of these bands that i thought were totally going to think were pu s like story of the year i just thought theyd hate us they listen to metal they have tattoos and were best buds on this tour the common thread of warped is the ethic

3628584 the internet community has become very polarized either you liked this book or you hated this book we took a stance that if you liked the book were going to be a place for discussion about that
3628585 we know that it was a disgruntled fan of the series who hacked our system it took place as a direct result of the lexicons backing of stephenie meyer and her work
3628586 if you were posting on every thread on our forums stephenie meyer is a terrible writer everything about it is horrible then we just arent the place for you
3628587 as her official fan site this needs to be a positive place where we can gather together and discuss what we like and have positive conversation hate spam makes it very difficult for someone to enjoy the site
3628588 if you hit the site with enough traffic its security measures begin to fall the message board had been spammed and it allowed a hole in the security net that somebody was able to get through and delete forums
3628589 because of the spamming there were so many ip addresses there is no shortage of suspects and no way to know which one exactly did the attack
3628590 the hole that enabled them to get into the blog has been sealed as far as contacting law enforcement we have been in contact with our server company and there are definite measures being taken to ensure that this doesnt happen again
3628591 its a very difficult time for the fandom in that you liked it or you really hated it everyone feels like they need to get their say but that means that the fans that really liked it need to have their site too the blog is that place for these ladies and a few men who have been worshipping this book for years
3628592 for those who were disappointed go be passionate about something else

3628599 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3628600 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3628601 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3628602 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3628603 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3628604 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3628605 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3628606 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3628607 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3628608 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3628609 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator

3628626 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their heads and having writers on board and producers that are into it its been a fun thing

3628638 its an attempt by certain western countries to internationalise the darfur problem for their own political ends
3628639 i reject the turning over of any african leader to the court
3628640 there are positive indications that the crisis will be resolved
3628641 security in sudan is considered a major part of egyptian national security
3628642 egypt plays an important role in keeping the peace in sudan both in the south and in darfur
3628643 the court is mandated with prosecuting individuals leaders and high ranking officials rather than governments parties or political regimes
3628644 sudan like egypt has signed the charter but its parliament has not ratified it until now
3628645 the courts jurisdiction extends to any country whether an icc signatory or not if the un security council citing a threat to international peace and security requests that the court investigate crimes committed in that country
3628646 this is why sudans claim that as a non signatory to the icc the court lacks jurisdiction is not legally accurate
3628647 historically the lack of development rather than ethnic differences has been at the root of the conflict
3628648 the west only began turning it into an international issue after the discovery of uranium and petroleum in darfur
3628649 considerable evidence of a u s french and israeli presence in darfur which has promoted rebel activity
3628650 if the rebels had not been supported and emboldened by these foreign groups the crisis would have been resolved five years ago
3628651 some humanitarian agencies in darfur are doing brisk business by inflating the numbers of victims and refugees to obtain more funding from the international community
3628652 such exaggerations also serve the ends of the foreign powers that want to internationalise the problem with the aim of dividing sudan
3628653 first sudan could simply turn al bashir over to the court
3628654 but if it refuses to do so the icc can request a un security council resolution under chapter 7 of the un charter to impose gradual sanctions on sudan
3628655 but could eventually escalate into a naval blockade of the country and then in a worst case scenario the use of military power to force sudan into compliance with icc demands
3628656 the un security council decision was a good omen for khartoum
3628657 arab and african efforts must continue in order to stave off further escalation against sudan

3628668 so far i have been trying to forget and i have not yet read any of the
3628669 with my two sisters mrs appleton the wife of e d appleton the publisher and mrs robert c cornell i went abroad about a month ago because of the death of another sister lady drummond in paris on our return we booked passage on the titanic as we all felt she was the biggest and safest ship in the world on the homeward bound trip with us was my friend miss evans who apparently died with so many other brave persons that night
3628670 up to the night of the shipwreck our voyage was the usual one at this
3628671 i was just retiring that night when we struck the iceberg there was
3628672 our stateroom was on the a deck there being only another deck above
3628673 we could hear others leaving their staterooms and asking what was the
3628674 it was some little time after midnight that capt smith followed by
3628675 then we saw the men lowering away the lifeboats and the women were
3628676 boatload after boatload mostly of women were sent away from the ship
3628677 i do not know just what time it could have been when some of the men called to miss evans and me to get into the boat three or four men seized miss evans and started to lift her over the rail which came to our chests but she repelled them and cried out for them to put me into the boat first as i had children
3628678 well those men took her at her word and put her down on the deck
3628679 i had not seen any boat being prepared there and i thin the order was
3628680 i have never seen miss evans since that awful moment when she bade the
3628681 when our boat pulled away from the side of the titanic she was so far
3628682 our boat was very poorly manned and equipped one of the men of the
3628683 even at the time we pulled away the doomed sea queens lights were
3628684 moreover i doubt if there was ever a finer exhibition of unflinching
3628685 as soon as we had gotten away a short distance it was apparent that the
3628686 that stewardess did know how to row and she instructed the other man in
3628687 she said that helping to row kept away the cold so i also took hold of an oar and assisted in my feeble way just to keep warm
3628688 we had not been away from the titanics side more than 15 minutes
3628689 when the end came for the steamship from the way she sank i
3628690 you can imagine the feelings of those in the boats as they watched the
3628691 we had rowed only a comparatively short distance from the titanic when
3628692 presently some of the persons in the boat said they thought they could
3628693 it was a floating capsized lifeboat from the titanic with about 30 men
3628694 the men in our boat called to the others to say that we could take only
3628695 by this time we must have had as many as 60 persons in our lifeboat
3628696 it seemed a long time before we got the many boats from the ship
3628697 i do not know just what time it was that the carpathia came to our aid
3628698 from what i saw and heard it seems that the lifeboat could not have
3628699 i heard nothing of the kind when were leaving the steamship an officer did display a revolver and threatened to shoot anybody who dared to try to leap into our boat he did fire one shot into the air to back up what he said but there was no actual shooting then or at any other time that i know anything about

3628710 on sunday zamalek will register the first three points in their african campaign against dynamos
3628711 there were proposals that we should remain in cairo until the next game against al ahly but we have since resolved to return home on monday
3628712 the foreign currency component became the major sticking point in our plans
3628713 we applied for the money through the reserve bank of zimbabwe but what we were given would not be able to cater for us to remain there for over two weeks
3628714 so we have no choice but to come back home and then return to cairo for the game against al ahly in two weeks time
3628715 we are going to give our best in cairo and i am sure everyone is ready for the battle
3628716 it has been proved that its possible to win away from home just like we did in tunisia and we have to apply our tactical discipline in the match
3628717 we had some drills at training during the week and now we need to implement them during the weekends match
3628718 both players are highly experienced and this means the coaches will be spoilt for choice
3628719 we have seen how zamalek play and we have also seen how al ahly play when the two teams met in their opening champions league match in cairo two weeks ago
3628720 i must say both sides are very good teams but we are determined to get good results in both matches
3628721 there was a four foot point blank 20 gauge shotgun wound on his shoulder
3628722 well he claims that he was attacked on his front porch
3628723 he said he got attacked but there wasnt a mark on him said britany girard
3628724 and if he shot the first dog and the second dog was running away then why would he shoot him
3628725 you could have said boo to these dogs and they would have run away

3628728 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3628729 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3628730 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3628731 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3628732 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3628733 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3628734 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3628735 im happy about the numbers as they are right now
3628736 it does feel good to have one person to focus on
3628737 its a little bit difficult to campaign when you dont know who youre campaigning against

3628754 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3628755 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3628756 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3628757 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3628758 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3628759 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3628760 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3628761 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3628762 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3628763 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3628764 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3628765 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3628766 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3628767 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3628768 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3628769 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3628770 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

3628775 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3628776 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3628777 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3628778 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3628779 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3628780 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3628781 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3628782 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3628783 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3628784 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3628785 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3628786 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3628787 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3628788 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3628789 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3628790 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3628791 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3628792 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3628793 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3628794 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3628795 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3628796 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3628797 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3628798 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3628799 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3628800 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3628801 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3628802 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3628803 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3628804 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3628805 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3628806 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3628807 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3628808 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3628809 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3628810 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3628811 why are you unplugging the light just dont turn it on in the first place
3628812 cooking with les dames descoffier at home with the women who shape the way we eat and drink
3628813 yes it is pretty enough and opaque enough to be worn as a dress but it is also shapewear that is sexy and when you take off your dress you have sexy lingerie on as well
3628814 i think nude is still a bit too naked to wear out
3628815 7 thats like 4 more than two its got to be better
3628816 something it has grown too well and now the clumps are so thick with weak stems sticking out all over what should we do with this mess
3628817 i can feel ok about spending money on myself without feeling selfish
3628818 this meal was as good as any ive had in england

3628829 once i was a scuba diver in the sea of words now i zip along the surface like a guy on a jet ski
3628830 its efforts to secure policy changes that improve the lives of minorities and low income people
3628831 i assumed that it wasnt going to be a problem obviously it was
3628832 were trying to make sure that its no more than 20 or 30 minutes
3628833 theres not an unlimited supply of voter terminals and we are working to meet it as best as we can
3628834 if i didnt make that putt back then i dont know where id be living
3628835 when i hung up my wife michelle asked me who was on the phone
3628836 i told her i think it was a golfer and i think hes coming to the house
3628837 especially a stranger who hadnt done much driving on the other side of the road he was just the most friendly generous person id ever met it was like wed known each other for 10 years already
3628838 i wasnt crazy for florida and the weather there i just had a lot of nice memories about greensboro
3628839 every morning there were five or 10 waiting for me they all told me what a nice guy andrew is and they were wrong hes even nicer in person
3628840 were fighting each other when we should be working together
3628841 some of us have heard from some principals who feel they can get more substantial results from within the building than from sending a large group to a national conference
3628842 it starts from finding your leaders in the community and building on that
3628843 thats why i offered to meet with them once i start
3628844 the board felt that he had done a really good job in all these areas
3628845 hes concentrated a lot on computer education and we have more technologists on board in the county now
3628846 its only limited by the imagination of the teacher and the children
3628847 something is working in one and something is broken in the other
3628848 at some point some red flags should kind of go up
3628849 we might be expecting more from a pool that just is low in numbers
3628850 it may be that we need to take a close look at the staff and whether summit house can pare down its staff for the program
3628851 were not sure how to increase that number but we heard that we could maybe go and screen people in the jail throughout the year
3628852 well just get together and see how we can reach more
3628853 this is our most significant capital investment to date in the companys history
3628854 building a new building is cheaper than paying the lease on the other buildings
3628855 its a good time to build from the aspect that some of the contractors arent as busy right now
3628856 malthus was certainly correct but cheap oil skewed the equation over the past hundred years while the human race has enjoyed an unprecedented orgy of non renewable condensed solar energy accumulated over eons of prehistory
3628857 it most certainly is on life support and now being sustained by cruelty brute force and lies
3628858 a true patriot is a lover of his country who rebukes and does not excuse its sins
3628859 so celebrate by making a thoroughly frivolous purchase today i know i will
3628860 the rules will help you to become a creature like no other
3628861 there have been a lot of false reports over the months about us selectors and lawson having spats over team selection
3628862 such reports are being spread by elements who want chaos in pakistan cricket
3628863 its healthy to have a discussion on the team combination that is why we make it a point to sit down and listen to the coach and captain shoaib malik before selecting the national team
3628864 its written in our contracts that the selection committees word would be final in selection matters and both the coach and captain know it
3628865 we are on the same side we came together after pakistan flopped in last years world cup and want to ensure that the team is ready for the next world cup in 2011
3628866 with fuelly you can compare and compete with other users for mileage bragging rights does that matter it could help you research real world mileage on a car model youre thinking of buying and it might be something you want if youre a competitive hypermiler
3628867 overall the point of fuelly is to make saving fuel more fun by connecting your stats with your friends and at this early point in its life it does a pretty great job
3628868 im looking forward to seeing how fuelly helps me and my family reduce our fuel consumption
3628869 fuelly taps the power of the masses to compile real fuel efficiency data so that users can find ways to save money

3628874 tera and angelina are friends and keep in touch via e mail
3628875 since welcoming the twins her fifth and sixth children with partner brad pitt into the world last month angelina has been approached to star in a variety of movies including the thomas crown affair 2 alongside pierce brosnan a role for which movie bosses want her to put on weight
3628876 i dont think i am beautiful i can look good and i can look ugly whats funny is that when i was younger i wanted everyone to look at me now i like to watch other people because you can learn a lot of interesting things

3628884 not just a different planet a different galaxy let him say which planet i get the same question all the time on the medal stand
3628885 i started thinking about it and thats when i started tearing up
3628886 to be at the top with so many great athletes whove walked in these olympic games its a pretty amazing feeling
3628887 im so happy that im a 25 year old working actress and that now people are starting to say i have brains
3628888 i wanted to be an actor more than anything else and thats what it means to be an actor its unexpected that anyone could think im a sex symbol i think that anybody who went to high school with me would be very surprised
3628889 i have always had this huge desire for acting and i was just lucky that i am able to do it
3628890 when i was 13 i joined a local theatre group and then i started doing commercials also my parents wanted to make sure i had a love of theatre and that was invaluable
3628891 things are slowly starting to get back on track jo knows the affair was based on vodka

3628895 im definitely coming back to the united states but for the time being im down here getting my mind right and my situation right i think itll be better for me down here than in new york cause theres a lot of sh t going on and i wouldve been involved in all of that
3628896 i still dont think weve played anywhere close to our best basketball
3628897 theyve been through the fire already and played a lot of high level games
3628898 just another entrance into the red ocean plethora of wikis lying around

3628900 dad just laughed and hit the ball again and almost made it into a bowl of gravy
3628901 our dad taught us all a lot of great things most of all to live life to the fullest
3628902 these three men are not happy with their new calling
3628903 but the men they are they have accepted the new calling and they will do it with the same voracity they have done everything else
3628904 we were thinking that an nba team was going to make an offer
3628905 as a single person i have learned to cope by myself and i have my own habits my daughter and good friendships which i have worked hard on so allowing someone else into my life is a huge adjustment
3628906 one minute i think somebody is the love of my life and then the next i dont
3628907 i am trying to let go of that and realise that no human being including me is perfect or can live up to a fantasy
3628908 the fans are crazy they know you everywhere you go
3628909 theres nowhere you can go in this city without being recognized
3628910 i couldnt believe that i felt like the pope for a minute i just play basketball
3628911 during this time i have managed to discover a few other blogs through it and i believe the
3628912 the doctors in vegas told me that i wouldnt be able to walk for four to six months and i thought to myself you just played in your last game
3628913 he really hasnt missed a beat and the amazing thing is he is moving around better and running better than a year ago because hes lighter
3628914 you see the movies of the guy pushing his wife in a wheelchair and her holding the baby i wanted that to be me
3628915 so that was my motivation to be walking before then
3628916 when the doctors told us that in the las vegas hospital she was worried she would have to be taking care of two babies
3628917 its been one of the great stories of the offseason
3628918 hes back and he might be better than hes ever been
3628919 were going to come back even stronger in the team finals
3628920 so what is the value of a blog and wiki
3628921 if these kinds of operations continue against us we will continue this
3628922 i think its one of the best one of the fastest around
3628923 our defensive ends are unbelievable the line is coming into their own and our dbs are great
3628924 its not like we were going up against a bunch of slouches
3628925 people talk about how inexperienced they are but what they fail to realize is a lot of those guys played a lot of snaps for us mike wright nai fotu and stevenson sylvester all played a lot its not like they havent been in a division i college football game before
3628926 if both are working its an 04 year that is the bottom line if they are both working together
3628927 how do you measure the value of an idea or tacit knowledge that has been captured in an exchange
3628928 the media tvs that doesnt include you are not worth watching
3628929 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses
3628930 were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses
3628931 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college
3628932 a lot of people have a reluctance to buy produce when they cant identify where it comes from or if it was handled properly throughout the process
3628933 a lot of people feel that if you can shake the hand of the farmer who grows your food you can be surer of its safety
3628934 theres no greater love than to show people what you know
3628935 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3628936 when one country conquers another that is typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not accustomed to
3628937 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
3628938 we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime
3628939 the united states is a reliable partner in the world
3628940 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3628941 we are committed to upholding our obligations to remediate remove or upgrade them as necessary

3628948 too few people are willing to face even the possibility of the cult like nature of bills political movement
3628949 also with xp and other failures getting pushed into even hospitals the cost is not just economic but actual lives but on just the money side with the us in the situation it is currently in having microsoft vista shoved down everyones throat may be the productivity killer that tips the recession beyond the point of no return

3629030 im shutting joba chamberlain down this guy has a hall of fame career as did kerry wood but kerry wood has been fighting arm issues for the last ten years because the chicago cubs ran him out there until his arm blew and im afraid thats what is going to happen here with joba chamberlain
3629031 im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
3629032 when youre in a boxing match you want to be the ocean when youre controlling everything thats around you both of these fighters are attempting to be the ocean they do not want to be the log that gets moved and drifted from place to place and thats why theyre being so careful
3629033 to do it all through the draft that would have taken too long
3629034 its too hard to overcome them if you dont now you have to go into free agency and spend a lot of money if you miss
3629035 it is certainly the most demanding american stage race and i expect it to be one of the most competitive

3629042 de burgers begrijpen dit rumoer niet en het bevestigt het negatieve beeld van de politiek
3629043 ik kan me voorstellen dat vvd en sgp uit de commissie tot verbetering van de verhoudingen in de gemeenteraad stappen
3629044 maar het was mij dierbaar geweest als dit voorkomen had kunnen worden
3629045 als voorzitter van de gemeenteraad wil ik juist stimuleren dat alle fracties over de jongste ontwikkelingen met elkaar in gesprek gaan eenzijdig niet deelnemen aan het gesprek is niet verstandig en zeer betreurenswaardig niet praten met elkaar is wel het slechtste wat je je voor kunt stellen immers als twee fracties vertrekken heeft zon begeleidingscommissie tot verbetering van de verhoudingen weinig zin
3629046 maar het is jammer dat het zo gegaan is de burgers begrijpen zoiets niet en het bevestigt het negatieve beeld van de politiek dit had beter gekund en er had meer uitgehaald kunnen worden

3629117 when you have the asian students there is a sense of secrecy and shame
3629118 its sort of like being told you were adopted or that you have a secret twin
3629119 you start to question what dont i know about my family
3629120 if it werent for the fact that there was photographic evidence i would be willing to believe i was born in the u s
3629121 when im a passenger in a friends car its exciting for me
3629122 it has really made me get excited about weird little things
3629123 i feel like everyone is growing up so fast because the next thing everybody keeps graduating and everybody keeps moving on
3629124 i think its different talking to someone whos dealing with the issue of finding out theyre undocumented and what that means
3629125 ive always known we were dealing with this since i was a little kid
3629126 without the dream act i have no prospect of overcoming my state of immigration limbo
3629127 ill forever be a perpetual foreigner in a country where ive always considered myself an american
3629128 if they had read the whole case file they would have known that we cant be deported anywhere and not have wasted their time doing it
3629129 ideas has played a very important role in providing direct assistance to undocumented students at ucla and advocating for the rights of undocumented students
3629130 because ive spoken out on it so much its the only aspect of me people know
3629131 the asian community should aggressively speak out in support of the dream act
3629132 they should notify members of congress that this is a tremendous issue that affects both the asian american community and society at large

3629135 keane and torres are clever players they scored plenty of goals last season and when they have played a lot more games together for us they will score here too
3629136 these two strikers are top class and they can be at the level of anyone in this competition they will get better and better
3629137 they will need time it has been a difficult summer with players arriving for training at different stages but i have no worries about them in the future
3629138 liege are in good form they beat anderlecht last weekend in the belgian super cup and last season in their league they barely lost a game and went over 30 without defeat at one stage
3629139 they did not concede many goals they have a strong defence and a quick attack we must concentrate
3629140 i am not thinking about signing players at the moment because they cannot play against liege i am only concentrating on this game
3629141 and i have not needed to contact the owners because they cannot help with the preperation for this match i prefer not to say anything else
3629142 i was really calm last week and i am concentrating on the game we did not have big problems
3629143 i have not been distracted i have been focusing on this game and getting to the champions league group stages
3629144 i always have confidence in my players but when you play against anyone in europe you have to be very careful we know standard are a good team especially at home
3629145 i know theres tremendous expectations here for what you would like to accomplish with this football program i can tell you that however you feel about it i have even higher expectations for what we want to accomplish i want to win every game we play
3629146 that is part of being at a big club the pressure of expectation is always very high
3629147 its a big day with a big meaning for us because the target is very high to be in the champions league
3629148 you know that when you come to holland you get a good game always no matter where you play and a tough one and we know as well that demands a lot of respect and concentration to do as well as we can
3629149 if you are a good football player you are a good football player whether its in the champions league or in another game
3629150 when you have the ball you make an intelligent decision
3629151 if you play against your friends on the beach or in a big game its exactly the same if you are a good player you are a good player
3629152 in england we have always to calm things down because after one month of games there is always the media pressure to make quick stars
3629153 players are young and patient development does not mean you cannot start early but it is most important to keep developing as a player and that you dont have to worry about too much pressure on your shoulders
3629154 i think it was a good move he maybe needed to get a change from england
3629155 to position yourself as an international coach is always a very good move for the rest of your career
3629156 i dont think united have another level to go to they had a lot of players who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years
3629157 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again
3629158 wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic
3629159 i think we can close the gap because man utd were at the very top of their game last season
3629160 but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3629161 the new manager has come in and made a few changes hes made some great signings deco looks awesome so im excited to see him play
3629162 we need to start well and get off to a flyer just keep winning
3629163 man utd have a few tough games early on liverpool have made some good signings and will be stronger this year we need to focus
3629164 having the flexibility to label products as multi country origin may mean participants that feed mexican cattle will not have to segregate them from u s born cattle the same will apply to canadian born cattle fed in the u s with the exception of beef that is being produced for south korea

3629174 the chinese womens gymnastics team made history today showing the world the china womens gymnastics team is the greatest
3629175 before they go out there i want them to believe in themselves and they all did
3629176 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3629177 we are human when it comes down to it we make mistakes and it came down to china had a better day today give us another day we could probably come out on top
3629178 i was just eager to do my routine and get the show on the road

3629204 anything that companies these days can do to reward loyalty especially as were all trying to cut back and pinch our pennies i think its greatly appreciated
3629205 for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation
3629206 it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices
3629207 more sellers accepting a loss is actually a sign of optimism it means that the transactions might start happening there are so many sales contingent upon the buyer selling their home

3629268 i know i can go faster but i had some water in my goggles and could simply see nothing
3629269 luckily i know how many strokes i need for 50 metres so i was just hoping that i would get it spot on
3629270 i could not have done this without bowman he is so intelligent in this s
3629271 growing up all i wanted to do was become an olympian
3629272 i couldnt see anything for the last 100 metres my goggles pretty much filled up with water it just kept getting worse and worse through the race

3629282 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3629283 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great

3629285 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well

3629287 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3629288 i realized that its ok not to want to do something
3629289 i have second and third thoughts and overanalyze nearly everything
3629290 so while things are not exactly perfect right now life is ok
3629291 years ago i used to think id never be happy
3629292 im still struggling with the idea of who i am and where im headed
3629293 i try not to obsess too much about the future just trying to enjoy the moments
3629294 i long for the chance to push the reset on my own life
3629295 i like to think in another life i own a small cozy cafe in the mountains somewhere
3629296 i feel like i am so many things and so few
3629297 the more the chinese become dependent on the rest of the world the more the rest of the world has influence
3629298 i dont think we should legitimize their government which oppresses people
3629299 of course youre going to root for the american team
3629300 women kind of wilt as men sort of achieve as they get older like wine or whatever
3629301 its like oh shes past her prime and she cant play a sex symbol
3629302 its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very vain vain industry
3629303 when i went to the oscars it was like oh theres been an archaeological dig and look what weve found a 40 year old
3629304 i was enjoying going fast it was pretty fun i just kept saying faster faster
3629305 it helps being positive nervous because youve been waiting four years for this
3629306 i was enjoying going fast it was pretty fun i just kept saying faster faster
3629307 i raced as well as i could i cannot affect what others do
3629308 theres no secret you just have to make it hurt imagine a friend sitting on your wheel shouting at you
3629309 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3629310 the governor absolutely must deliver the resources needed to make this mandate succeed
3629311 gateway to critical thinking pivotal for success in science engineering and technology
3629312 i am certain that some will oppose this goal as unattainable and overly aggressive
3629313 its too early to put a price tag on these efforts and more critical to identify the elements of the plan i do think that we have had better conversations about algebra and math readiness in the last 20 days than weve had in the last 20 years
3629314 we really need the money now we need this plan now
3629315 im glad to see the state superintendent is embracing the goal of teaching algebra to all california eighth graders and moving forward to improve educational achievement in california
3629316 i look forward to working with the education community to determine the best way to implement and support californias nation leading algebra i test standard
3629317 the best way we know of to get kids ready for algebra in the eighth grade is to get them to grade level in mathematics and arithmetic in seventh grade
3629318 they shouldnt need more money to get the kids to where theyre supposed to be
3629319 were pleased to see things out on the table so that we can sit down and discuss this for the betterment of the students
3629320 its always a problem when the state shoots first and asks questions later
3629321 given that students have a constitutional right to education its always problematic when the state sets a standard but doesnt provide the resources to achieve it
3629322 a lot of the kids were capable but they werent disciplined enough to sit down and do their homework every night
3629323 at redwood we saw a lot of kids that came in and then had to repeat algebra i again in the ninth grade
3629324 we have many fine programs out there in excellent districts that are and have been doing this for years
3629325 marxist things have the unfortunate tag of being regarded as
3629326 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
3629327 you see it was the only workers i could get
3629328 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
3629329 you see it was the only workers i could get
3629330 if this feeling is a thing which i can get rid off by my own will it would have been done long back so i wont have to cry now because it kills me so bad inside

3629346 for many evangelical leaders rick warren is either a little too naive or a little too shrewd
3629347 he is threatening to water down the essential message of evangelical christianity
3629348 and that is what causes people to grow a little insecure and concerned and maybe even disconcerted

3629351 steve as a former 11 year employee of microsoft i was dismayed to find a microsoft photo contest which encourages image piracy here is the e mail that i have recently sent
3629352 i feel very excited because we sacrificed a lot to win this gold medal and this is a direct competition between the chinese team and the usa team and we are very proud that we won
3629353 i didnt expect this medal my coach told me that even eighth place would be okay
3629354 other swimmers have endurance but my advantage is speed i gave it all that i had hopefully the bronze medal will encourage our team

3629357 lo que sullivan ha hecho es una gran respuesta a mi r cord pero lo principal aqu es clasificarse
3629358 i have thousands of pages that are indexed in google but are low quality pages i want to get rid of them primarily as a benfit to the users as these pages dont have as much information as i had hoped what i want to do is 301 all of these pages to their parent page on the same site but higher up in the tree should i 301 all of them and in about 6 months delete the files should i do a robots txt block on them and then 301 them once they fell out of the index should i just let them go 404 and fix the links so no user can see them i think a 301 would be the best but thousands of 301s to go up overnight will that hurt me with google
3629359 i would just delete them too if people want to see the content they can use google cache and once they no longer turn up in the results then google will have eliminated them entirely i have deleted a few pages lately and you get to see in wmt how quickly google sorts it out
3629360 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
3629361 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations
3629362 i should say i am ready for the one day challenge i have been working hard in the nets i have also practiced some shots which i hope will help me counter the lankan spinners
3629363 i think it pitched in line and was hitting middle
3629364 yeah you are correct and the height seems to be okay
3629365 actually it pitched outside off and hit him in front of middle so there is an angle and there is a distance for the ball to cover so your basis for giving it out is wrong let me have a look
3629366 in modern warfare its not unusual to see opposing forces take over tv stations radios and newspapers in our century taking over the internet sites is now part of the same kind of strategy
3629367 does an internet attack warrant a reaction from nato what about the un is there such a thing as a just internet war and what is a countrys right to defend itself against one
3629368 hey babe pick up the phone and ill take you to qdoba mmmmm qdoba

3629371 we have had a good first leg now it will not be easy in the return
3629372 but the spirit was right the team has responded well as has the public i am satisfied with the performance
3629373 there should be no issue with getting it done in time its simply a case of waiting for the relevant processes to unfold

3629382 if you have good players and a big stadium then i think you need to play in the highest league in europe
3629383 but this is football if you dont win these two games then you wont qualify and youll play in the uefa cup
3629384 to be honest it was quite a big shock when fc twente won the play off because in holland everyone expected ajax to win
3629385 but in the end twente played better than them they had two good games one i think they won 4 2 so yes it was a shock but these things happen in football
3629386 something like that happened to me you know i im not exactly sure what it was sometimes i remember it one way sometimes another if im going to have a past i prefer it to be multiple choice ha ha ha

3629436 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under
3629437 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3629438 its something i have dreamed about for a long time
3629439 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3629440 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat
3629441 i got into radio when i was 17 and it was something that i really enjoyed
3629442 what i love is being able to talk to people and put together a story thats what i love about sunday arts putting together a story and structuring it its really creative in its own way
3629443 im stupidly obsessed with electronic music and new experimental music i love rock music thats kooky or got a bit of a twist to it bands like animal collective instrumental rock is the daggy word
3629444 i consider a lot of the electronic artists to be almost they arent going to be in the canon of great classical musicians but what theyre doing is not that far off
3629445 i thought i dont want to rock the boat here ill only ask a couple of questions but his answers were so detailed and he wanted to know what the next question was and we ended up being 20 minutes i felt terribly guilty about it but it was so brilliant that this was a guy who just didnt play the game he wanted to give proper intelligent and thoughtful answers and its just like watching his films theyre extremely heady and intellectual and dream like crazy and beautiful
3629446 im gay and i have no problems with that at all
3629447 its not something i worry about its who i am my mother would be very proud
3629448 she would email me and say she saw something on the internet about me and i would say mum stop looking at the internet
3629449 i think my joy in life is there are elements in society that i think are discriminatory but in this industry at least everyones been open minded ive never experienced any insult
3629450 i saw her at the last sydney film festival after party all dressed up in a femme tux not many breeders would do that

3629453 the secret impresses no one the trick you use it for is everything
3629454 in england the 80s have come back and lived on and our song is quiet similar
3629455 i never think of us as trying to sound like that genre i know the 80s thing is the bandwagon at the moment but we like it
3629456 electronics in the 80s were trying to emulate things and they did a bad job of it
3629457 its all about the arpeggios in the keyboard and the snare sound
3629458 the cool thing about the 80s is even though it was all really electronic and some of the production was fairly pathetic the songwriting was so fantastic for example the smiths production was really light and the lyrics were amazing
3629459 our music is quite commercial as well and it can appeal to a lot of people we enjoy certain scenes but we hope people enjoy our music its bizarre and it always surprises me i love how wide our fan base is
3629460 the way we work best in the studio is when everyone has left and its just the two of us left in the room to muck around with gear
3629461 its really a creative time when its the two of us its really relaxed and we work on the ideas thats the best time in the studio
3629462 we also tend to engineer our own vocal sessions rather than use someone else we record each other singing its easier to keep it simple
3629463 i just thought the name sounded right for me i liked the idea of the double life that one thing at night another during the day idea suited me
3629464 i just love the whole lindsay buckingham stevie nicks story
3629465 how they asked lindsay to join the band and he said only if my girlfriend stevie comes i think thats awesome
3629466 the stories that you hear about fleetwood mac all the crazy stuff you hear stories about how stevie nicks hired a person to blow cocaine up her arse with a straw
3629467 god no i think my rider contains beers and vodka maybe juice if im lucky
3629468 i grew up with a wonderful dog but my cat was this bastard shitty cat that used to scratch me on the face all the time
3629469 but then i started meeting all these really amazing cats
3629470 i had this big show in london and my friend noted that the majority of the audience was really cute gay indie boys
3629471 i had my first headline show recently and the crowd was so diverse it was such a mixed bag there were even a couple of little kids in the audience
3629472 ive written seven of the songs and three are co written with grant adele and glenn from the go betweens are with me its not oceans apart 2 its something else but with trails going into the past and im proud of it
3629473 the album is an emotional and primarily acoustic real instrument feeling album i want people to be able to lean into the record and feel comfortable with it
3629474 it explores how our personal space is confined by the pressures of modern life

3629476 i couldnt see anything for the last 100m my goggles pretty much filled up with water
3629477 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest but its fine i wanted to break the record and wanted to go 1 51 or better but in the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3629478 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3629479 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3629480 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3629486 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3629487 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3629488 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3629489 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3629490 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3629491 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3629492 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3629493 extremely urgent problem with esx esxi 3 5 update 2
3629494 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3629495 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3629496 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3629497 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3629504 the urgent and critical situation of the indigenous peoples sector has brought us here
3629505 the arroyo government is wiping out indigenous communities all over the country through its militarist and aggressive economic policies another reason is that the president does not intend to cease these injustices
3629506 the realization of the rights of national minorities to ancestral lands and self determination will only be fully realized when the government is no longer bound by capitalist interests until then the indigenous and moro peoples rights is only second to the interests of companies interested in the resources found in ancestral domains
3629507 the accc considers that the information to be extracted from the trial has the potential to deliver benefits to the public by assisting governments to determine the most effective way to achieve their goal of reducing plastic bag consumption nationally
3629508 it was always going to be the case with fuelwatch and im particularly unsurprised about the comments from mr xenophon this morning
3629509 of course in the lead up to the vote in the senate we will be taking senator xenophon up on his offer of discussion and if theres anything he can propose that meets his concerns while meeting the fundamental policy aims of the government to get more transparency in the petrol market and get rid of what is effectively collusion in the market we will be happy to talk that through
3629510 there are severe criminal penalties for collusion and on that basis we strongly suggest that any suggestion of collusion in the petrol market be supported by factual evidence rather than throwing around baseless accusations
3629511 we support more information being provided to the consumer and we acknowledge that the average motoring consumer may not understand the different elements that make up the price of petrol at the pump let alone many of the products they pick up off the grocery shelf
3629512 but this lack of information should not be confused with transparency
3629513 why should the motorists of australia not have access to the same price information that the good motorists of western australia have had for many years mr rudd said
3629514 the liberals are the ones who control this in the senate and what the liberals have done federally is to side with big oil companies against consumers
3629515 it is the liberals who decide what happens in the senate theyve decided that they will back big oil companies rather than give information to consumers like motorists have had in this state for many years
3629516 we will continue to argue for fuelwatch well wait and see what happens
3629517 i mean nick xenophon with due respect hasnt yet been sworn in as a senator hasnt yet sat there in the senate
3629518 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3629519 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3629520 youre dealing with the majors theyre big bureaucracies theyre slow
3629521 yes theyve got enormous power but a quick nimble independent can work around them
3629522 i want to put in no uncertain terms that i consider it and i trust most people are with me here much more important to be human than to be anything else

3629526 if another member of the church sins against you go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone if the member listens to you you have regained that one but if you are not listened to take one or two others along with you so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses if the member refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church let such a one be to you as a gentile and a tax collector truly i tell you whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven again truly i tell you if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask it will be done for you by my father in heaven for where two or three are gathered in my name i am there among them

3629529 did you humbly and patiently accept this mystery of iniquity in your life how did you deal with it did you learn from it to be patient and humble did it teach you to trust not your own ability but my love did it enable you to understand better the mystery of iniquity in the lives of others did it give you the most typical characteristic of a truly religious person that he never judges or condemns the sin and imperfection of others

3629542 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3629543 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3629544 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race

3629548 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3629549 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3629550 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3629551 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3629552 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3629553 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault
3629554 i think everybody knows you always have good days and bad days i just wish today was a good day

3629559 i didnt know anything about it until juan pierre said he took all his bats and went on in
3629560 so i said well wed better get him out here manny was still getting on me about it today
3629561 i was sitting there when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3629562 he was probably 8 feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3629563 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3629564 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3629565 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can
3629566 this is what you get on a nightly basis in every single game hes done something positive to help us win
3629567 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar
3629568 now theyre seeing it and how he can change a game
3629569 hes a lot of fun but youve got to really get to know him
3629570 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think
3629571 gold would have been better but im not going to complain im probably the most surprised person of all at the way i finished you have a secret hope but you like to keep it a secret because it sounds so arrogant to say i can win a medal and then dont get one

3629578 this may be the first time a physical signature for a personality disorder has been identified
3629579 its new and different because its not a lesion or injury to the brain but it is a difference in perceiving information that comes from an interaction
3629580 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signalling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
3629581 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
3629582 this new option to abort and restart constitutes a decision that should be made based on the level of confidence about getting a reward
3629583 ultimately confidence about getting a reward is a direct function of the animals confidence about the decision they have just made in this way we sought to measure a variable internal to the animals how confident they were about whether they made the right choice or not by observing how it influenced their behaviour
3629584 that confidence estimation is not a complex function specific to humans but a core component of the process of decision making probably found throughout the animal kingdom
3629585 we found one variant to be associated with weight and lean mass in both ethnic groups this variant was also associated with height total fat mass and hdl cholesterol but only in european american women a different variant was associated with triglyceride levels and hdl cholesterol in african american women
3629586 insects store fat like mammals do as lipid droplets accumulated in the fat body the functional equivalent of both mammalian liver and white adipose tissue
3629587 drosophila share many components of fat biosynthesis degradation and regulation with humans including many of those implicated in diabetes and obesity
3629588 now that we have access to intermediates that were not previously available people will want to do careful studies on their pharmacological activity and we were getting yields of 100 to 200 milligrams per litre which is respectable for potentially valuable molecules with relatively simple optimisation of the fermentation you could obtain 10 or 100 times more than this
3629589 we are now hoping to extend the pathway both ways to get a broader range of intermediates downstream including the end products and to be able to start with simpler substrates upstream
3629590 the system will also allow us to start producing non natural alkaloids by using enzymes from different sources and in combinations that do not occur in nature
3629591 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
3629592 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
3629593 the excitement here is that were not talking about red wine any more were talking about real drugs we will make a drug to treat one disease but it will as an added bonus protect you against most of the other diseases of the western world one of the drawbacks of resveratrol is that the doses need to be large

3629604 we will have many problems come sunday if we miss chances which take so much effort to create
3629605 but it was the match we all expected it was very interesting for such a special occasion the fans were great and enjoyed so many chances
3629606 i saw some interesting things i am pleased we are now focusing on the weekend there were no injuries and i am satisfied
3629607 most important is that they played their first minutes and proved they are unquestionable starters for our team for metzelder it was important that he did not hurt his foot again
3629608 i am also pleased with rub n de la red they all withstood the rhythm of the match having fresh legs and players like robinho and baptista come in in the second half allowed us to play at a faster pace

3629708 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3629709 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3629710 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy

3629788 for many evangelical leaders rick warren is either a little too naive or a little too shrewd

3629795 they dont want to rebuild the soviet union but they do want a sphere of influence
3629796 i think this was aimed much more to the west more to ukraine central asia and the other caucasus states
3629797 i worry that any country in the region such as ukraine that has been tilting towards the u s may now think twice they may lean back a bit toward russia

3629801 the russians at the time said that they may well retaliate by stirring up trouble in abkhazia and south ossetia and i think many people said well thats going to be mostly talk in fact theyve gone ahead and done it
3629802 is demonstrating to the rest of the world that the united states is not the sole superpower any more or if it is its so stretched that its not going to come to your aid
3629803 that weakens the u s position globally quite a bit
3629804 we are like an example for the others that russia can do the same to anybody
3629805 they must be stopped they wont stop by themselves theyll start with georgia and then it will be poland and estonia and ukraine
3629806 they are invading us and its happening in the 21st century and the whole world is watching

3629814 he was so down to earth considering who he is and who hes worked with and the amount of work hes done
3629815 youd think hed be the typical hollywood star but he wasnt hed have lunch with you would call on birthdays and remember all that kind of stuff i appreciated that about him that i could talk to him about anything and felt comfortable around him he was like another uncle to me

3629825 though decades of economic research suggest men and women are equalizing in the labour market the notion that todays working women are being paid more and treated better than ever before is simply wrong
3629826 the growing equality between genders reflects the entry of the most able women to the workforce rather than better pay
3629827 while there may be more women holding high power positions today they are still being paid as their counterparts were three decades ago
3629828 weve found that octopuses effectively have six arms and two legs observations showed that they use the rearmost two to get around over rocks and the seabed
