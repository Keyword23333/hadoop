1460020 recently come to light of publicity successive cases of seizures of old books and arrests of their owners it is surprising what factors of the ministry of culture guided such actions especially when they are not based on the existing legal framework the department of the ministry of culture ephorate of antiquarians and private archaeological collections has repeatedly assured those concerned that the old books do not fall into provisions of the law for the protection of our cultural heritage law 3082 2002
1460021 in a period of spiritual drought in our country any criminalization of the collection of old books and therefore the book lovers would have devastating consequences both for the book which everywhere is saved and maintained thanks to the love of book lovers and of scientific research
1460022 the pantomime is an ancient greek art there is no french as many believe it born in greece before the ancient drama and i think that every actor is a mime pretending or mimics something the sign at the theater holds the position of poetry in literature
1460023 the myths concept is timeless the artists involved with them because there are not binded by time and because they are relevant with the human relations and contemporary reality
1460024 in bad acts perpetuated in dealings with sons and mothers which are always special or those of sons with fathers that are often very conflictive
1460025 through a literature study i discovered the existence of an original sin of laiou the father of oedipus who loved and viase a young chrysippo who committed suicide from there then begins the curse of this particular family and we see the how it develops
1460026 reading the paper of kathimerini for the risks of suffering for the collectors of old books and the names of friends who signed the protest i urge them to follow of what i did some months ago as a holder of books from the 16th and 19th century first by inheritance from my grandfather my mother and my father second from my expense both here and abroad and to avoid the problems that costas karras is in i burned all my old books this is not prohibited by law while to be a holder old books is illegal of course because some of the books i am using for my studies before i destroyed i photocopied them from what i understand the possession of photocopies of old books is not prohibited i urge my friends to proceed with the same action

1460029 the municipal authority recognizing the enormous importance for the city of two old industrial sites elaiourgeioy and cronus initiated the process of urban regeneration
1460030 especially in elaiourgeio we projected to create the new archaeological museum which has promised us by the prime minister for this reason strikes me that within three months the kas change position which in principle banned and then allowed the storage of liquid caustic soda company in sintra former votrys tangential of the archaeological site and houses
1460031 we hope that the prime minister of culture will not adopt the opinion of kas
1460032 such a decision means further delays and huge cost it is not a priority

1460100 every day growing up he said hey if you want to go to the park and play im here for you
1460101 once or twice a week wed go over to the park id shoot penalty kicks on him
1460102 id always try to keep the ball from him and hed always steal it we always battled each other
1460103 at about 14 or 15 i really started watching mls and really got into international soccer trying to emulate the way these guys play and the way they did things
1460104 especially a guy like french world cup winner zinedine zidane who i watched a lot
1460105 ive felt like ever since i was young i was able to see plays a little bit ahead of time i knew what i wanted to do when i got the ball i think that makes the game a lot easier you know whats going to happen next
1460106 it would be a dream to play on a team like that they just keep the ball on the ground and they move it and move it theyve got so many guys who are technical i just really enjoy watching that team play
1460107 im almost there i feel like lately ive been getting in a groove where i feel very comfortable on the ball i feel a lot stronger on the ball i think my decision making has been good ive been working hard every day to make it to that level i want to be in europe soon
1460108 i think those three are not only top flight leagues with some great teams but also fit my style of play i feel like in spain my technical ability would help a lot in germany there are some really good players and its a really strong league from top to bottom so thats cool italy is obviously a very strong league as well
1460109 japan is going to be a very tough team but i think its definitely a team we can go and take three points off of and put ourselves in a real good position

1460113 pasteurising and filtering a beer kills off a lot of the natural flavours

1460135 the roving snp cabinet meeting has attracted a lot of media attention and it would be wrong not to recognise the cabinet is meeting in inverness today but what is really important is what the cabinet discusses and agrees about issues vital to the highlands whether meeting in edinburgh or here
1460136 did ministers today commit the cash they saved by cancelling the rail project to edinburgh airport for a definite and precise timetable to dual the a9 or did they agree to continue playing with vague words about some future upgrading
1460137 what decisions did they agree on the a82 and a96 upgrading and the inverness southern distributor road promised by the snp before the election
1460138 did they agree to give highland council more cash so they could begin to reverse the disastrous cuts in education that are seeing teacher numbers being reduced and cuts in services for those with learning disabilities
1460139 did they agree to reverse their decision to constrain highland health boards funding causing it to fall behind increases in the rest of scotland over coming years
1460140 did they agree to drop their plans for means testing highland pensioners for central heating grants
1460141 did they decide to maintain their commitment to give highland first time home buyers a 2 000 grant promised at the election or did they stick to ditching that commitment
1460142 are highland students now to have their student debt written off as promised at the last election or does that promise remain broken too

1460210 health insurance companies in california spend billions of californias health care dollars each year on administration and for profit insurers divert billions of dollars more to profit californians health care dollars should be spent on health care not on bureaucracy
1460211 its not acceptable for us to ignore such massive waste in the insurance industry when californians are being bankrupted by rising and gutted benefits
1460212 california consumers have a right to know that there is a basic formula in the law for how much of their money is actually being spent on medical care this is the least we should be doing

1460426 consumers have the right to basic information about what theyre buying
1460427 this bill is all about transparency about ensuring that so called junk insurance is no longer a part of the market
1460428 to the extent that increases are passed on to individuals continued declines in access to care are inevitable
1460429 this report paints in stark terms why health care costs are skyrocketing for californians
1460430 health insurance companies in california spend billions of dollars each year on administration and for profit insurers divert billions of dollars more to profit californians health care dollars should be spent on health care not on bureaucracy
1460431 its not acceptable for us to ignore such massive waste in the when californians are being bankrupted by rising health insurance premiums and gutted benefits
1460432 california consumers have a right to know that there is a basic formula in the law for how much of their money is actually being spent on medical care this is the least we should be doing
1460433 its a small number but a powerful result because it shows how paying for health care is reflected not only in family budgets but in life decisions
1460434 the fact that 47 million individuals in our country do not have health insurance is often mentioned but it is rarely noted that more than twice as many
1460435 we believe that a stand alone dental product will help increase access to important dental care
1460436 our research with columbia indicates that promoting preventive dental care can have an impact on the overall wellness of our members
1460437 this leadership team will create the most honest most open and most ethical congress in history

1460443 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1460444 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1460445 inflation has been high and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1460446 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee

1460480 lower prices mean less pain at the pump but tougher times ahead for the economy
1460481 but as the governments fiscal stimulus program did earlier this year it lower oil prices could give consumers a little more change in their pockets either to spend salt away or pay down their debts

1460486 we do a daily forecast for the state with our meteorologists and the bureau of air quality to find whether or not we are going to be in problem situations for ground level ozone or what some people refer to as smog
1460487 ground level ozone is formed when hot dry stagnant weather conditions exist
1460488 when that happens emissions from vehicles contribute to the formation of ground level ozone
1460489 most of our action days in the past have been in the upstate or in the midlands areas or the central savannah river areas
1460490 this is one of the first times weve seen it in the pee dee or the trident area of the state
1460491 the meteorologists believe it is not anything associated with more pollution but rather with the weather conditions were experiencing

1460508 theres a pent up demand from people on the right side of the aisle who feel that the mainstream media is effusively covering barack obama and not critically covering him
1460509 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
1460510 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
1460511 fleeced how barack obama media mockery of terrorist threats liberals who want to kill talk radio the do nothing congress companies that help iran and washington lobbyists for foreign governments are scamming us and what to do about it
1460512 with book like these the minute some people know theyre out there they must have them
1460513 the anti obama readership is largely one that has already made up its mind and is looking for validation while the obama readership comprises both those who have already made up their minds and those who are curious about him
1460514 mccain doesnt have the same kind of resonance its nothing in comparison because you can still shape peoples view of obama but its way too late to shape their view of mccain
1460515 gets people excited about the idea of reading a book
1460516 books from both the left and the right often work this way
1460517 this is jeff haas your host for this hour of music exploring the art form of jazz and its connection to classic rock r amp b blues folk and more
1460518 my dads philosophy was lets make this music accessible to anyone and everyone
1460519 my goal and its a lofty one is to sort of extend that vibe of accessibility engaging people on an emotional level with great music
1460520 most people dont commonly associate jazz with other types of music but in reality all popular music in this country comes from jazz
1460521 at first i was wondering if i might be boxing myself in maybe i would run out of connections in a year or so
1460522 but the possibilities are really endless someone was influenced by someone else or covered one of their tunes or shared the same mentors so many different avenues to explore
1460523 the music engages people opens hearts and minds on a level that you couldnt effectively do through words
1460524 im sure there will be some hard core classical music listeners who wont be interested in jeffs show but most of our audience came of age listening to the beatles and elvis and abba and mancini in the 60s and 70s my guess is theyll have a more inclusive attitude than their parents did about what makes great music
1460525 i bring my own musical biases to the table and the opportunity to produce this show has helped me address them
1460526 its really about the challenge of keeping an open mind

1460530 you can argue as many do that this performance is nothing more than a case of holding out the umbrella while it rains money that its all due to the dramatic run up in the price of oil

1460541 much more important than the general attempt to link the anthrax to islamic terrorists there was a specific intent indispensably aided by abc news to link the anthrax attacks to iraq and saddam hussein in my view and ive written about this
1460542 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
1460543 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
1460544 we dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud

1460546 we have offered to adopt the baby and ensure that it is bought up well and the mother need not have any concern on that score the church very clearly takes a clear and strong stand about the abortion we are totally against it
1460547 we have decided not to buy any product from traders in jammu and instead buy products directly from other markets like delhi and amritsar
1460548 we will not cooperate with the traders of jammu anymore we are not going to buy any goods from them we have decided to boycott jammu traders
1460549 the situation in the aftermath of economic blockade of the valley and attacks on minority community in jammu has made it clear that it is part of a well thought out conspiracy and the centre is involved in it
1460550 the amarnath yatra for long has been a source of income for the poor people of the state and a symbol of communal harmony the entire issue was messed up by the congress pdp coalition government in connivance with the outgoing state governor s k sinha
1460551 at the all party meet proposed to be convened by prime minister manmohan singh we will press the government for arriving at a solution that is agreeable to both the communities
1460552 rss vhp bajrang dal and hindu mahasabha leaders form the core of the sangharsh samiti spearheading the agitation in jammu against revocation of land to amarnath shrine board and are backing the agitation they have the support of bjp
1460553 if the bjp is a responsible national party they should try and understand what the implications are for india
1460554 national parties do not realise that j amp k is a sensitive state this is like playing into the hands of those forces who want to weaken india
1460555 negotiations cannot be held in a vitiated atmosphere we are looking for an amicable solution acceptable to all

1460560 the tatas that they want to pull out of singur
1460561 it the possibility of the reduction in lefts strength in the polls is a speculation but some seats may be reduced like we won in 19 seats out of 20 in kerala last time and this time there may be some shortage but we are working to increase the overall strength
1460562 the bjp is trying to float the idea that indian polity is bipolar and either congress led upa or bjp led nda would come to power in the parliamentary polls we want to prove that the idea is wrong
1460563 when we are working for the third front how can i talk about any new political equation but if any equation arises then we will see
1460564 our national veterans affairs council president alma lee has had limited dealings with mr hager and those dealings have been positive
1460565 opm has many important responsibilities in the months ahead not the least of which is leveraging the size of the federal employees health benefits program to keep healthcare costs for federal employees from increasing
1460566 the presidents interest in making this long term appointment is an attempt to continue the past eight years of failed and ideologically driven personnel policies within the federal government
1460567 we oppose the nomination of anyone to this key position who advocates a pay for performance system as it is currently proposed
1460568 mr hagers 35 years of business experience in human resources as well as his general management experience suggest that he is ready for the challenges of this position
1460569 i found him to be serious a dedicated professional a person with a desire to serve veterans but more importantly a person that truly did understand that sometimes were asked to serve a country
1460570 i think theres no doubt that you want someone who has experience in organizational transformation steady state management isnt whats called for in the federal government
1460571 one of the reasons for the challenges we face is we have short term political appointees who are not incentivized to focus on the long term organizational challenges in government
1460572 the security has been beefed up after the terror strikes as narmada dam is a very important installation of the state
1460573 we have obtained sketches of seven suspects who could be involved in jaipur bomb blasts we are studying them for any link with ahmedabad serial blasts

1460578 india is an extremely exciting market for us right now we see in india a unique combination of a customer base ready to use our products and services partners who can deliver our solutions nationally regionally and globally and a sophisticated cadre of technical experts who can amplify our efforts to develop next generation products and technologies
1460579 our priorities for india are to build a presence to serve our customers partners and to gain access to the innovation and expertise here
1460580 security regulatory compliance and operational excellence have become high priorities in india bigfix offers attributes ideally suited to india and south asian conditions
1460581 this government is not for the common man but to serve the interests of one man
1460582 i will meet congress high command soon and offer to resign from this government which is not doing anything for the common man but working to further interests of industrialists
1460583 i had seen this variation some time back black needs to be very careful and very well prepared it is hard to find the right defense with limited time on the clock
1460584 production of natural rubber increased last month due to favourable weather conditions and increase in tapping days there was excess rainfall during the last week of july last year there was loss in tapping days as tappers were afflicted with viral disease
1460585 the consumption has grown due to high demand from tyre industry production and exports of tyres have increased
1460586 exports increased due to wide gap between domestic and international price in the previous months
1460587 this sensor doesnt resemble any other light sensors previously discovered
1460588 that doesnt mean shining an ultraviolet light on people in wheelchairs will suddenly allow them to walk but it does give us a tool that we can use to solve the mysteries of nerve cell communication and can ultimately help us understand the biology of everything from sleep memory to depression

1460593 the chinese want a better life for ourselves and our children for that they are willing to sacrifice everything a steady income as a factory worker a social life with friends and a space in a factory dormitory to realise that goal
1460594 most chinese are optimistic about the direction in which their country is moving but they too are paying more for their food and thousands of factories are closing down in china because of inflation
1460595 republicans and independents who care about new hampshires air and water should know about his votes for almost 6 billion in taxpayer handouts to the air polluting coal industry against less arsenic in drinking water and against holding polluters accountable for their actions

1460599 senator mccain wants americans to forget that during the republican primary he said that americans were better off than we were eight years ago and that he thinks weve made great progress economically
1460600 i think the fed would rather wait until after the election before they consider raising rates
1460601 that will give them time to get a better view of the economy and see if financial markets have become less fragile
1460602 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1460603 during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding
1460604 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal

1460608 and when you fast do not look gloomy like the hypocrites for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others truly i say to you they have received their reward 17 but when you fast anoint your head and wash your face 18 that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you
1460609 our business model has been highly successful and we remain very bullish on our growth prospects as the market for natural and organic products continues to grow and as our company continues to evolve
1460610 however the challenging economic environment appears to be negatively impacting our sales
1460611 what should be noted today is whether you violate the federal law today tomorrow or 20 years ago the fbi web and its law enforcement partners will pursue the matter to its logical conclusions
1460612 they tried very hard to convict him up here they spared no resources and it didnt work

1460614 wer so einen abschied bekommt der kann beruflich nur alles richtig gemacht haben
1460615 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1460616 the inflation fight probably will have to wait until 2009
1460617 conditions at this point do not seem to dictate an immediate tightening
1460618 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1460619 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1460620 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1460621 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1460622 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1460623 they seem more concerned about growth for the rest of this year and id say right now they appear to be dovish for the short term
1460624 every great and commanding moment in the annals of the world is the triumph of some enthusiasm
1460625 experience is not what happens to a man it is what a man does with what happens to him
1460626 some men see things as they are and say why i dream of things that never were and say why not
1460627 education matters if we are really serious about building a first world economy then we must ensure that every child no matter what their background is given the skills to contribute to their fullest possible extent to our nations future that is why it is surely a national disgrace that one in five new zealand children leave school without the most basic reading writing or maths skills since the vast majority of new zealand children around 96 percent attend state schools it is the government that must be held accountable for this massive failure after three terms in office there can be no excuses

1460637 he who works his land will have abundant food but he who chases fantasies lacks judgment
1460638 here at liars equity mortgage were the only company with the ability to take advantage of these new rate cuts from the fed
1460639 liars equity advertised that their mortgage bank offers consumers low rates free appraisals and guarantees the lowest interest rates and fees
1460640 in fact liars is not a bank the fees they charge more than cover the cost of the supposedly free appraisal and their guarantee of the lowest rates and fees cannot be substantiated
1460641 here at double dealing subaru weve sold so many outbacks this year were getting truckload after truckload of new vehicles every day

1460648 and remember that the newer the ship the better the chance that contemporary amenities and features were part of the original design rather than being shoe horned in
1460649 are nice to look at although im not sure why anyone would pay for one
1460650 im at a lost to know why anyone would want to sit there anyway that strikes me as an awful lot of money to sit in a plastic tent when the rest of the ship is so much nicer
1460651 if they were to do it its very logical and makes perfect sense
1460652 its a great way to identify early stage technologies and opportunities and tap into a broader network of entrepreneurs
1460653 google has acted a bit like a vc or at least an incubator since going public
1460654 initially it empowered employees to try new things with 20 percent of their time
1460655 however clearly not every innovator already works for google so it makes sense for them to have a vc arm
1460656 if they end up being bad at it then it sort of could tarnish that google shine
1460657 it could also continue to foster this idea of google as having excessive monopolistic power
1460658 thats more of an issue from a regulatory perspective if people think wow not only are they trying to take over the world themselves theyre trying to take over the world with stuff they fund the paranoia could go rampant
1460659 the positive is youve hopefully got an exit buyer lined up the downside is it has a chilling effect on other buyers because they are at a disadvantage they have to pay full price
1460660 theres always that concern if googles already a shareholder and on the board who knows about long term intentions strategic issues whatever
1460661 some people come to scotland to play all the name courses
1460662 it can be more fun and economical to play each course twice most courses have a second play for 5 10 pounds so you can play 36 holes for about 100 pounds or about 200
1460663 if you wanted you could play 54 holes a day
1460664 i want you to think about dogmo before you say anything else you might regret at some point okay
1460665 and this gabby from winnipeg you just let her go like the instant she didnt fit your needs this is terrible
1460666 this isnt about that doctor patient privilege thing is it
1460667 instead of trying to slash your brothers face with a steak knife i want you to transmute those feelings of absolute hatred into feelings of absolute pleasure okay
1460668 you know how youre afraid of using public restrooms well hes afraid of using any restroom
1460669 lots of real men have high voices i just cant think of any of them right now
1460670 well i did my best i cant help it if theyre completely deranged
1460671 im dialing officer harrups right now im gonna tell him that you once confessed to killing a migrant work out at newbridge farms just to see what it would feel like they never found the body
1460672 prices of food and other stuff are just not affordable anymore down here
1460673 whatever i tell you in the dark speak in the light and what you hear in the ear preach on the housetops
1460674 if barack doesnt pull our troops out of iraq and afghanistan youre going to have to choose which side youre on because there will be a lot of pissed off people in this country who arent going to stand for whats been happening any more
1460675 your dress is done cowrie shells being beaded on youre going to look beautiful im out of town until july 20th

1460677 ill just send an invoice to your mother you dont have to worry about that
1460678 well your mom said you had a budget of 700
1460679 its a little bit more because of the material ill just send an invoice and you wont have to deal with that you have enough to worry about so what do you think
1460680 where are you where is the dress im leaving for new york this morning you can give it to my mom
1460681 im in mia miami international airport my moms picking up the dress i will have her take it to your mom
1460682 its amazing that no european has won in such a long time when you consider the strength of european golf over the last few years
1460683 we werent up on the bar like we were then
1460684 i think our footprints have only just been rubbed away and yes the barman remembered us
1460685 i notice they have given us a bit of fairway short of 17 and nine so if you want you can lay up
1460686 although it is longer it doesnt alter the clubs into the greens
1460687 for instance on number four we were hitting a hybrid or three wood to the top of the fairway and then hitting a wedge down
1460688 now the tee is moved back 20 30 yards so now we hit a driver to the same spot so although the course is playing longer off the tee it just forces us to hit more drivers
1460689 tal vez en otras circunstancias de mi vida hubiera sido diferente
1460690 im sorry ive been transfered back to my school because i could not focus on my studies in that school
1460691 this is a feature that many of us at ars have been dying for of course you can currently export your gmail contacts and import them on address book but who wants to do that when you can have it happen automagically
1460692 its nice to see spanning sync picking up the torch on contacts as the competition on calendaring heats up
1460693 the best news comes at the very end of the screencast spanning sync v2 0 will be a free upgrade
1460694 its a free upgrade to those who pay for the upgrade
1460695 could you get access to a crane with a wrecking ball how about a chainsaw or sledgehammer metaphorically speaking you may need some heavy equipment to do all the demolition work thats necessary right now among the structures that could be due for destruction a mental block youve been preserving out of perverse nostalgia a prison cell you lock yourself inside on your off days a half built bridge youre no longer interested in or capable of completing a pedestal on which your fallen idol used to stand and a door you nailed shut in order to seal yourself off from a person with whom you still have unfinished business
1460696 please tell me you are on a relay and that you arent naturally that fast
1460697 what these things oh honey i can make up fashions on the toilet it aint anything special
1460698 die man moet geruime tijd in totale afzondering hebben geleefd anders kun je zoiets niet met droge ogen beweren
1460699 hoewel er de afgelopen maanden enkele journalisten zijn vrijgelaten blijven anderen vastzitten en worden er nieuwe opgepakt de chinese autoriteiten maken gebruik van staatsveiligheidsmisdrijven om journalisten vast te zetten en tot stilzwijgen te brengen
1460700 mensenrechtenverdedigers en hun familie worden in de aanloop naar de olympische spelen steeds harder aangepakt degenen die het verband leggen tussen mensenrechtenschendingen en het plaatsvinden van de spelen in china hebben het het zwaarst te verduren
1460701 blijvende betrokkenheid directe contacten en de uitvoering van concrete samenwerkingsprogrammas zijn naar het oordeel van de regering meer effectieve instrumenten om op een positieve manier invloed uit te oefenen op de chinese autoriteiten en de mensenrechtensituatie daadwerkelijk te verbeteren
1460702 they must have spent a lot on lord of the rings
1460703 ich war 16 als der krieg zu ende war als reporter zu arbeiten war damals die einzige m glichkeit aus deutschland raus zu kommen und das wollte ich
1460704 als ich das erste mal nach moskau kam war der druck auf dissidenten gro in dieser situation habe ich dort menschen getroffen die mich sehr beeindruckt haben leute die sich innerhalb des sowjetischen systems ehrlich verhielten
1460705 wir beschlossen auch in deutschland eine organisation zu gr nden die sich f r politische gefangene einsetzte
1460706 nat rlich setzten sich damals auch politische gruppen f r ihre gefangenen ein aber wir waren sehr darauf bedacht zu zeigen dass wir uns f r keine seite des kalten krieges instrumentalisieren lie en das war das besondere und neue an amnesty
1460707 nat rlich kann bei einer organisation die inzwischen so gro ist wie amnesty die menschenrechtsarbeit auf verschiedenen ebenen stattfinden das halte ich grunds tzlich f r eine gute sache
1460708 wichtig ist dass politische menschenrechte und freiheitsrechte ihre zentrale bedeutung f r amnesty nicht verlieren sie sind die grundlage aller menschenrechte freiheit ist nicht alles aber ohne freiheit ist alles nichts
1460709 das land hat sich sehr ver ndert viele meiner alten freunde sind inzwischen gestorben und ich muss mich neu einrichten
1460710 auf die dauer wird es so sein dass sich russland eine eigene politische linie zurechtlegen und amnesty dort wieder auf granit bei en wird man muss trotzdem versuchen auf institutionen einzuwirken und die menschen zu unterst tzen die sich f r grundfreiheiten und menschenrechte einsetzen
1460711 ich glaube nicht dass er das system auf den kopf stellen wird denn er arbeitet eng mit putin zusammen trotzdem ist er eine andere generation und seine vergangenheit ist nicht mit dem russischen geheimdienst verkn pft medwedjew ist sicher daran gelegen ein mindestma an rechtsstaatlichkeit zu sichern denn sie bildet die grundlage f r wirtschaftliche entwicklungen doch wer glaubt dass in einem oder zwei jahrzehnten in russland so etwas wie eine parlamentarische demokratie entsteht der irrt das halte ich f r ausgeschlossen
1460712 ich werde diesen platz mit dem urteil nicht schuldig verlassen
1460713 wir m ssen die unabh ngigkeit der medien sch tzen die eine verbindung zwischen der gesamten gesellschaft und der regierung sichern freiheit ist besser als unfreiheit
1460714 von anfang an wurde es so verstanden dass auch der k nig dem gesetz untersteht
1460715 vor dem immer wiederkehrenden missbrauch durch die exekutive oder legislative zu sch tzen
1460716 sahen den schutz vor unrechtm iger verhaftung als fundamentales freiheitsprinzip
1460717 die judikative die pflicht und das recht hat den kerkermeister zur verantwortung zu ziehen
1460718 zu vertreten die politischen arme der staatsgewalt k nnten nach ihrem willen die verfassung an oder abschalten w rde zu einem regime f hren bei dem nicht mehr dieser gerichtshof sondern diese dar ber entscheiden was rechtm ig ist
1460719 weil den gefangenen seit mehreren jahren jeder wirkungsvolle zugang zu einem juristischen verfahren verwehrt wurde
1460720 den gefangenen steht das recht auf unverz gliche haftpr fung zu
1460721 ich bin 51 jahre alt das ist ein teil von mir
1460722 hier habe ich elf kinder gro gezogen hier hat mich meine mutter gro gezogen
1460723 ich habe einen mann getroffen der aids hatte und in einem haus wohnte in dem das wasser stand und das vollkommen verschimmelt war
1460724 in diesen geb uden verkriechen sich menschen die unter paranoider schizophrenie oder hiv leiden viele werden sehr krank und sterben ohne dass man sie erreichen kann
1460725 nat rlich sind wir besorgt besonders jetzt wo wir ein kind haben
1460726 sie verteilen flugbl tter auf denen steht man habe 30 tage zeit zum auszug aber wo sollen die leute hin wenn sie nicht wissen wohin was sollst du da machen
1460727 eigentlich m sste ich geld aus dem road home programm bekommen aber darauf warte ich immer noch
1460728 wenn man in einer stadt lebt die auf so vielen gebieten v llig berlastet ist versagen die normalen systeme die zwar auch niemals angemessen waren vollkommen
1460729 es f llt den menschen viel schwerer wieder auf die f e zu kommen sie leiden unter einer kollektiven depression und diejenigen die sowieso ganz unten sind haben es am schwersten
1460730 frag die mal warum sie h user abrei en die noch v llig in ordnung sind w hrend die obdachlosen unter der br cke schlafen m ssen
1460731 die schwarzen sollen abhauen sie geben uns die schuld an der hohen kriminalit t sie halten uns f r den abschaum der stadt
1460732 in diesem viertel hier m chten sie lieber yachth fen bauen sie w nschen sich ein update von new orleans bei dem wir nicht mehr vorkommen
1460733 i dont like the jews so im going to freeze my head until they get wiped away

1460739 we should air her nude special to the masterbating public at night to honor her memory
1460740 lets poke the drunk passed out chick in the vagina with a sharp pointy thing and see if she reacts then well do it again and put it on camera

1460742 i cant eat anything today because i want to be as then as a toothpick
1460743 i fucked ever truck driver in the world while writing this song
1460744 you may now break the glas carefully wrapped in the tissue thin napkin and potentielly slice your foot off giving your husband another reason to go through the prom agency and fuck ever single prom queen in the world
1460745 das thema ist nicht ganz so leicht wie es auf den ersten blick aussieht
1460746 wir haben in guant namo sehr gelitten doch wir leiden hier weiter andere gefangene hatten ihre l nder wir haben keinen ort wo wir hingehen k nnen
1460747 einige l nder bestreiten sogar dass diese personen ihre staatsb rger sind
1460748 es ist schon ironisch dass die us regierung gegen ber anderen l ndern bedingungen stellt die sie f r sich selbst in guant namo oder abu ghreib nicht gelten l sst
1460749 unsere verfassung und die milit rjustiz bieten eine ausreichende grundlage um mit terroristen fertig zu werden
1460750 neulich kam ein mann hier auf der baustelle vorbei und wollte einen job
1460751 diese menschen m ssen sich irgendwie in die gesellschaft integrieren und gezwungenerma en tun sie dies auf der untersten ebene in der schicht die am st rksten unter druck ist sie erhalten keine unterst tzung dabei das kann eigentlich nur katastrophal ausgehen
1460752 diese rechte nicht nur den amerikanern zustehen diese rechte stehen der ganzen menschheit zu
1460753 wir alle wollen vor terrorismus gesch tzt sein aber der preis dieser sicherheit darf nicht sein dass unschuldige amerikaner immer wieder f r stunden festgenommen in handschellen gelegt und verh rt werden einfach nur weil sie wieder in ihr eigenes land einreisen wollen
1460754 au ergew hnlich ist nicht dass die usa inkonsequent scheinheilig oder arrogant sind
1460755 warum die usa sich dieses versagens schuldig machen und gleichzeitig eine treibende kraft bei der entwicklung und durchsetzung globaler menschenrechte waren
1460756 eine der schlechtesten entscheidungen in der geschichte des obersten gerichts
1460757 conservation may be a sign of personal virtue but it is not a sufficient basis for sound comprehensive energy policy
1460758 i stopped along the way to clear away a pile of rocks and debris that was blocking the road this bag of gold was under it all and i want you to return it to its rightful owner
1460759 oh no this is not mine ive never known such money
1460760 may god bless the eurodam and all who sail on her
1460761 it should not depend on the state a person lives in whether they have a quality product
1460762 theres a disconnect between those services available in a community and the way they are described in a and no two companies have the same definitions
1460763 the majority of consumer complaints my office receives about are about the double digit rate increase they received on products they purchased in the late 80s and early to mid 90s
1460764 we have long established relationships with health net members and we have excellent physicians on our who have provided care to health net members for years
1460765 we are excited to have the opportunity through this new agreement to continue caring for them
1460766 we had thought it was going to be a two to three year effort to make the policy changes happen
1460767 this report paints in stark terms why health care costs are skyrocketing for californians
1460768 health insurance companies in california spend billions of californias health care dollars each year on administration and for profit insurers divert billions of dollars more to profit californians health care dollars should be spent on health care not on bureaucracy
1460769 its not acceptable for us to ignore such massive waste in the when californians are being bankrupted by rising health insurance premiums and gutted benefits
1460770 california consumers have a right to know that there is a basic formula in the law for how much of their money is actually being spent on medical care this is the least we should be doing
1460771 could you tell me what happened i see that the flags are flying half mast and i was wondering if something had happened that i had missed
1460772 b52 you say they are very old planes arent they
1460773 yes they are but they are some of the best and sturdiest in the fleet
1460774 it is just sad when something like that happens i didnt even know about it i am glad that i saw the flags and asked

1460780 to deregulate the market would make a bad situation even worse
1460781 this a landmark step on the road to justice for the thousands of innocent patients those health insurance was retroactively canceled this announcement applies to only 26 people but the same law used here will provide reinstatement for thousands more we look forward to working with the department
1460782 however we caution that reinstatement must be retroactive to the time of the policy cancellation and must be liable for all health expenses from the date of issuing the contract through the date of reinstatement were also very concerned about the states plan to subject the remaining thousands of cases to unnecessary and lengthy third party reviews before restoring their coverage

1460803 valued for their expertise in kidnapping torturing and killing defenseless civilians
1460804 we should worry about the men held at guantanamo because history shows that stripping prisoners of their rights is intoxicating not only to leaders but to functionaries at every level of society
1460805 established a network of illegitimate prisons where torture took place

1460814 at a point in both mussolinis and hitlers takeovers citizens witnessed a stunning series of quickly escalating pronunciamentos or faits accomplis after each leader made his bids for power beyond what the italian parliament and the german reichstag allowed him each abruptly started to claim all kinds of new rights that were extra parliamentary the right unilaterally to go to war to annex territory to veto existing laws or to overrule the judiciary

1460817 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
1460818 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
1460819 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
1460820 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
1460821 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
1460822 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
1460823 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
1460824 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
1460825 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
1460826 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
1460827 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

1460831 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
1460832 i think its just getting to the point where the opposition has just overreached so badly and the insurance companies actions have been so egregious that both sides of the aisle are getting fed up with them
1460833 the goal is to try to put a stop to this practice because it is hurting a lot of people
1460834 it is not only a financial burden on the people when their coverage is pulled they cant get treatment

1460840 we have initialed the text of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain last july 27 2008 the pact is a done deal it is binding on the contracting parties who are obliged to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of their agreement
1460841 the act of initialing the agreed text between the parties constitutes a signature of the philippine government and milf
1460842 done with a credible third party witness the malaysian government as facilitator of the talks since 2001
1460843 it should be implemented and up to the national government to comply with it
1460844 this temporary delay has disappointed all of us and at the supreme court we will present our case why we should continue with the signing of the memorandum agreement for ancestral domain which is within the law
1460845 we are confident eventually we should be able to return and have this memorandum on ancestral domain signed
1460846 what should simmer in our minds is for peace and tranquility to exist there ought not to be violence in any instance
1460847 we are calling for calm on all sides and not to be provoked
1460848 if the milf is saying this is a done deal then it only goes to show how untransparent the government panel is to its constituents
1460849 the real enemy of mindanao is the grp panel these are the modern day judases who almost sold parts of mindanao
1460850 i call upon the zamboange os to consider the grp panelists persona non grata
1460851 blatant sellout a treachery to the future generation of mindanaons
1460852 as long as the highest rate of poverty is in the armm as long as the highest rate of people who cannot read and write are still in the armm we will never have peace no matter how many peace agreements are sign
1460853 protest actions like these are the best way of highlighting grievances more sensible and more humane than harassing villages of unarmed settlers burning houses of civilians and taking hostage non combatants just to project strength
1460854 we have already spoken in previous plebiscites that we dont want to be part of the autonomous region in muslim mindanao and subsequently the expanded armm so there is no more reason for our villages to be included in that ancestral domain
1460855 i appeal for calmness and tranquility the provision of moa is nothing to be afraid about because nothing is final yet the moa is just a guideline and basis to proceed with the peace talks or final peace negotiation
1460856 meaning it is just a piece of paper i respect the decision of the sc its their function
1460857 declaration of both sides to sit down for the formal negotiation and identifying the agenda of the negotiation
1460858 the final agreement will have to be operationalized and still needs legislation
1460859 we are governed by the rule of law so we respect and abide by this decision
1460860 let us practice patience and prudence they are very small sacrifices for the sake of peace i am still hoping that sc will hear and resolve this issue as soon as possible for the sake of peace in mindanao
1460861 secrecy and treachery characterized the governments handling of the issue and it backfired its now becoming clear that the agreement on ancestral domain specifically the formation of the bje is being tied to efforts to amend the charter
1460862 once a bill has been filed in congress seeking investigation of the bje i will request the secretariat of the house of representatives to bring the public hearings closer to the most affected people to bring it to mindanao
1460863 we will hear all sides both from the pro bje and the anti bje especially those who are vehemently protesting in the streets we will give them a chance to speak their minds off on the issue

1460865 if it keeps on raining we win it didnt and we got seventh we took a chance and it just didnt work out like we wanted it to we still got a top 10 and had one of the best cars out there today
1460866 we had a good race car today just not as good as the 99 of edwards probably a second place car
1460867 i got a little messed up on the strategy call when we decided not to pit and take track position before the red flag so we were a little fortunate to come out of here with a seventh place finish
1460868 in the end we moved up to ninth and then a couple guys ran out of gas so well take the seventh place finish it was a good day for us in the points race and kasey drove a great race
1460869 the best way for us to make the chase is to remain consistent with our race car each and every race its a tough battle right now for us to come here and gain two positions in the chase is a credit to kenny and all the guys that work on this dodge theres still a lot of racing left but today was a good day for gillett evernham and all the guys that work on our team

1460876 in the house chamber and across the nation this week house republicans are standing united with the american people in protest of speaker pelosis decision to send congress home for five weeks without a vote on increased american energy
1460877 more than 1 4 million americans have signed a petition demanding that congress pass legislation to lower gas prices and increase production of american made energy tomorrow former speaker newt gingrich will join house republicans in the capitol to present a message on behalf of these americans and their families as our nationwide protest continues joining reps mike pence of indiana tom price of georgia and others who have courageously led this gop uprising on the house floor newts presence and support will further energize this unprecedented nationwide effort as we continue to call for congress to give the american people a vote on increased american energy
1460878 millions of americans have been forced to permanently suspend their vacation plans this summer thanks to the prohibitive cost of fuel all were asking is that democrats temporarily suspend theirs so we can finally have the debate on energy the american people expect and are frankly shocked we havent had
1460879 having former speaker gingrich lend his time and support to this campaign represents a tremendous boon to that effort it also provides a stark contrast to the lock it away position on american energy the current speaker of the house continues to advocate even as our dependence on middle east oil grows more dangerous and severe by the day
1460880 american families are crying out for relief at the pump and democrats have adjourned the house for a five week recess
1460881 tomorrow we will welcome speaker gingrich to help continue this unprecedented coast to coast effort to shine a spotlight on the democratic congresss failure to hold an up or down vote on the american energy act this legislation does it all and to solve americas energy crisis thats exactly what we need to be doing the american people support house republicans all of the above energy solutions in overwhelming numbers speaker pelosi needs to call congress back from its five week recess and hold the up or down vote on the american energy act and let the will of the house prevail
1460882 it is fitting the leader of the first republican revolution now returns to support this republican revolution for american energy security and independence
1460883 this fight will not go away until speaker pelosi allows an up or down vote on energy legislation that relieves the back breaking burden on our citizens
1460884 it is ridiculous to walk away from our critical work at a time like this for five weeks of vacation the chairs where democrats should be seated are now filled with everyday americans who have come to the house floor to listen and respond to the republican call for greater supplies of american made energy this is a vote that must occur i am proud that tomorrow former house speaker newt gingrich will be joining this effort here in washington and i also salute the republican congressmen and women scattered across the country working tirelessly to force a vote from speaker pelosi
1460885 speaker gingrich has been a consistent and eloquent leader in the republican efforts to bring badly needed relief to american consumers who are suffering record high gasoline prices
1460886 his return to the house will draw additional attention to the fact that nancy pelosi continues to block congress from voting on common sense energy legislation and hopefully it will turn up the heat on democratic members of congress to demand that their leaders stop their obstructionism and get back to work
1460887 we are in the midst of a genuine energy crisis and we need an all of the above energy policy to get out of it

1460896 the first quarter highlighted the tension that exists between pursuing near term growth opportunities and making the necessary investments to prepare for sustainable future growth results within the quarter were softer than anticipated due to increased efforts to further develop our sales organization which resulted in more attention being diverted from closing current opportunities than originally planned we also witnessed a lengthening of sales cycles across some customer opportunities due to the current economic environment
1460897 with that said we have made improvements in the last several weeks including a number of key management changes to realign the focus of our senior leadership to regain momentum and capitalize on the significant opportunity that exists for orion and its shareholders
1460898 we have a bunch of them we have some free agents looking good some draft choices looking good we are a young football team but we have been pretty impressive thus far but you have to put it together in gameday and game situations i am looking forward to them playing some exhibition games and see how they do when the lights are on
1460899 he has done a good job we have some competition amongst the wide receiver positions we have a pecking order right now but it can change very quickly there are a lot of guys competing and it will probably come down to game situations and obviously the remainder of camp
1460900 it is like all hamstrings it will take a little bit of time to rest but champ recovers pretty quickly it wasnt a bad hamstring so that is good news
1460901 anytime tom sits out of practice it is not just another injury because it is tough to keep him out of practice he is obviously sore but it is healing better according to greek steve antonopulos hopefully it will keep getting better so he can get out there and practice i think he has the experience where he doesnt really need the preseason games and he is working hard in the weight room to make sure his conditioning level stays at a certain point hopefully in the next couple weeks we can get him back and he will be ready for the first regular season game right now the mri is negative so we are not going to do surgery just to do surgery hopefully rest will be enough but we will find out in the next couple of weeks when some of the pain subsides it is very painful like i said if tom is not out there then you know it is quite painful
1460902 he has been doing this for awhile as you know we had 17 ota days and he was very impressive the more reps a quarterback gets the better he feels when we put him in some game situations like we have been doing out here he gets to experience some of this before our preseason games he feels more comfortable with the system and more comfortable with himself he has been doing a good job and hopefully it shows up
1460903 it has been pretty good im adjusting to everything learning the scheme and trying to do what the coaches ask
1460904 it was kind of rough the first couple of days in otas but i have gotten used to it its not too bad
1460905 we have a lot of talent up front the coaches are doing a great job of putting players in the right positions to make plays we should be pretty good on defense this year i cant wait
1460906 i wasnt here last year but i can feel a sense of urgency with the guys just trying to get better than last year
1460907 the coaches i played for last year were great coaches but the coaches here are really putting guys in the right positions to make plays
1460908 i dont do numbers i dont set numbers for myself i just try to come out and help this defense get better and help my team win
1460909 probably to cause havoc penetrate the backfield and disrupt plays
1460910 those guys from what ive seen since ive been here they been working their butts off and getting better each day they have been coming along pretty well
1460911 marcus is a very explosive defensive lineman he can cause a lot of bad plays for the offense he can get in the backfield and disrupt plays and just cause a lot of negative plays
1460912 due in part to an increase in industry wide costs and to curtailed production growth from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2008 we saw our per unit operating cost structure increase in the second quarter the curtailed production growth during the second quarter was due in part to compression downtime and drilling delays in ozona northeast and east texas despite these challenges my outlook for the second half of 2008 remains positive we are starting to see early results from reevaluating our geological model and acquiring the deep rights in ozona northeast we recently drilled and completed our first strawn well in ozona northeast since our acquisition initial flow rates from the j r bailey a 313 averaged 987 mcfe with a flowing pressure of 1700 psig over an initial 24 hour period in addition to the productive strawn interval we encountered an expanded canyon sand section this expanded sand package should facilitate further expansion of our proved acreage position we also have identified several attractive canyon recompletion opportunities resulting from the acquisition we are currently incorporating the recompletions into our existing stimulation schedule and plan on starting this program in the third quarter of 2008 our exit rate of 25 1 mmcfe d at july 31 2008 is a record high for the company given our existing drilling inventory we believe we are well positioned to grow shareholder value in 2008 and beyond

1460920 it ended up just being the simple things that let us down
1460921 we played the better rugby though if you look at the stats on possession and territory we were the better team we just blew it with silly mistakes close to the line
1460922 the conditions really suited the way they wanted to play but we have taken heaps from the game and are all looking forward to continuing on with the rest of the season
1460923 david holwell played really well and was dictating the game with his kicking
1460924 they have a big forward pack that looked good last week so we will approach this weekend the same way we did last the last game
1460925 i had a good season with the chiefs and obviously that helped my decision to stay and play for waikato
1460926 its a really professional outfit here and im looking forward to the rest of the season
1460927 i know that whatever decision is made will be the right one for the players
1460928 i still think we need to stick with something close to the super 14 though
1460929 its a little bit weird and im sure its going to be a big occasion and one i am really looking forward to
1460930 our young fellows are really stepping up and taking authority which is impressive and we will get better and better as the season goes on
1460931 we created too much slow ball for ourselves and we couldnt get a flow on so a little bit more aggression at ruck time will improve that part of the game
1460932 obviously i worked a bit with smiles chris smylie when he was down with the hurricanes so thats working out well and well just keep improving the combination outside me and getting that running smoothly and once that gets going then the back three will get a lot more ball
1460933 its just the offloads any wellington team they are just out there to offload and thats their game so we just have to be aggressive in defence and stop those offloads and look after their support players
1460934 because once they get the flow on theyre pretty hard to stop whoever theyre playing so as long as we look after those offloads we should nullify that a little bit
1460935 wed always want to get a win but seeing the big guys go down it gives you a lot of encouragement seeing the little unions getting up over the big guys wellingtons a big union and they havent been tipped over yet so its our turn they won at home so hopefully we can do the same on thursday night
1460936 it is very disappointing because hes a senior player but in saying that martin purdy has come back from injury and hes rearing to go and hes a similar player to bernie so im sure we wont lose much there
1460937 obviously this is america and people are free to live together without being married however michigan voters and the supreme court supported the legal definition of marriage as between one man and one woman reinforcing the publics view on lawfully recognized bonds between individuals it is irresponsible for any public institution that receives tax dollars to use those funds for anything that goes against the accepted majority view to reflect those wishes i continue to propose a 5 percent reduction in state funding to any college or university that offers health care benefits to employees unmarried partners
1460938 the air new zealand cup remains our premier domestic competition and we want to ensure it maintains that status remains a true national championship that engenders provincial pride and rewards those players that perform in their club competitions it is our belief that these changes and the management mechanisms outlined below will deliver on those aspirations and eliminate the sustainability issues that have challenged us with the current format
1460939 some of these ideas have been suggested or promoted previously and have been well supported in some of our research with rugby fans so we are excited at the prospect of putting them into action we are very committed to ensuring that club rugby has its own time and space as we see the regeneration of the base of the game as critical to our long term future

1461030 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1461031 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1461032 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1461033 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1461034 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1461035 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1461036 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1461037 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1461038 for people who are relocating to this area a 20 30 minute drive is nothing
1461039 sorry to go on anger real steaming fucking anger can make a man verbose all the best
1461040 they surely had no intention of sabotaging your deathless prose
1461041 we would be losing in iraq if we listened to obama
1461042 obama continues to oppose offshore drilling and continues to oppose the use of nuclear power
1461043 describe the stories of american leaders and their contributions to our country
1461044 lives and contributions of three american indian cultures of the past and present
1461045 why intel decided to promote it only as a classroom device but not as a cheap affordable laptop for multipurpose
1461046 cuda is just our brand name for the c compiler they arent two different things
1461047 cingular doesnt want to see their west coast network go down because some application messed up
1461048 you can write amazing web 2 0 and ajax apps that look exactly and behave exactly like apps on the iphone and these apps can integrate perfectly with iphone services
1461049 we dont want our friends to start their photocopiers any sooner than they have to
1461050 a new coat of paint can make all the difference
1461051 when we moved in the kitchen was painted a dirty color and the ceiling had that popcorn look
1461052 we scraped the ceiling smooth tore down a wall and relocated the refrigerator to create a more open kitchen then we painted the kitchen a bright cheery yellow painted the cabinets white and added funky rainbow colored hardware to the cabinets
1461053 use existing cabinets and either update them with paint or cut out portions and insert glass to create a different look
1461054 buy a new accent rug or paint your kitchen table a new color things like these are inexpensive and can make a big difference
1461055 you can impact huge change just with paint and decluttering
1461056 get rid of all the extra stuff on your countertops like those appliances you never use the pile of incoming mail and other things youre not really using
1461057 if you can afford it update your cabinets surfaces and finishes
1461058 consider tiling your countertops with colors and patterns that look similar to granite or use granite tiles instead of a solid surface which will save you money
1461059 there are also laminate coverings that look like granite allowing you to copy that high end appearance they are so convincing that youll need to touch it to know for certain if they are granite or formica
1461060 the kitchen is the heart of the home and everyone wants a clean simple beautiful look that they dont have to update
1461061 renovating your kitchen is a great investment plus you get to enjoy it
1461062 blueberries are one fruit that is leaping from the vegetable garden rows into landscape designs
1461063 we definitely wanted to ensure it was attractive to a local audience
1461064 we asked for a lot of opinions but at the end of the day my husband and i had to like it too
1461065 if you live in a starter neighborhood with 250 000 to 300 000 homes and you create an addition and end up with a 600 000 home and have to liquidate it good luck getting that money out of the house
1461066 try to keep the style in line with the period of the home
1461067 i feel like half the community helped me build the house
1461068 if theyre confronting 100 000 in costs and they might not be able to afford that the house might not make sense for them
1461069 what costs people a lot of money is that they need it all done tomorrow
1461070 because gas and fuel costs are way up people are looking at that more closely when they buy a house
1461071 with children its nice to have my study centrally located
1461072 my husbands study is further away in the house which is much less convenient
1461073 i didnt know when to throw things out and julie taught me how long to keep paperwork like credit card statements and bills
1461074 i learned that with so much online access you dont have to keep all this stuff anymore she also created a great filing system that simplified our office spaces considerably
1461075 a lot of people choose a downstairs bedroom and thats not always the best place
1461076 think long and hard about where the home office will go
1461077 most of us tend to land in the kitchen area for example so often the home office gets located there by default in a busy family thats where everyone congregates and where the phone is sometimes it makes most sense to have your office in or nearby to the kitchen
1461078 eighty percent of what we file away we never look at again
1461079 most people save far more than they ever need which is why its so hard to retrieve what you need when you need it
1461080 the key is dealing with the mail on a daily basis so it doesnt pile up
1461081 so much of what we get in the mail needs to be recycled but the roadblock people encounter is making decisions and dealing with their mail
1461082 being disorganized is very costly to people and sucks the life out of you
1461083 i believe that being organized enhances life by giving you time to do the things you love to do
1461084 we had to stay in a hotel for two weeks after we moved with all our possessions in a moving truck and our dog with us too it was crazy but we hadnt had the time before we drove cross country to new jobs to scout out the area
1461085 people dont have a good account of the lead time it takes to get a quality mover especially in the summer months
1461086 were booked ahead 15 to 20 days and though someone might find a spot in that time they shouldnt count on it
1461087 if youre going to talk to movers about your move start six weeks ahead of your moving date so you have time to make a comfortable decision without being rushed
1461088 all movers have minimal coverage included in the price with optional additional insurance available but theres no point buying it if youre already covered so check about that in advance
1461089 its okay to contact a mover through the internet but dont do all your arranging that way you need to have human contact with the mover
1461090 its the easiest time to be left at the altar
1461091 you really have to have all your ducks in a row
1461092 that way youre not surprised when you attempt to buy a house
1461093 one of the quick things you can do is correct errors
1461094 or if there is 500 or 1 000 in collections paying those off quickly can raise the score
1461095 just because a bank says well loan you this amount of money doesnt mean you can afford it
1461096 work it backwards whats your monthly payment how much does insurance cost taxes then you can decide
1461097 are you going to be lying in bed at night worried about a 2 200 or 3 000 a month mortgage payment its a reality check
1461098 she was always following through and we never had a problem
1461099 most borrowers will not benefit if a fee is more than a half point
1461100 if youre a first time buyer we want to start the process ahead of time up to four to six months
1461101 i tell people lets set the table for success then when its time its a simple transaction
1461102 buy a house with at least one extra bedroom than you need now or space to accommodate extra bedrooms like a basement or extra large attic that can be converted
1461103 were presently converting one garage and opening it to our kitchen and dining room to create more space
1461104 it costs between 80 and 100 per square foot to convert a garage into living space but its worth it because it will give our children extra room to play
1461105 find a good neighborhood and a home you can enlarge update and remodel as your family grows a home that lends itself to expansion
1461106 the lots tend to be narrow on the street and wider at the back so you do have to be careful about your choice if you want to enlarge your home in a few years time
1461107 from what ive seen the schools are pretty good everywhere in whatcom county
1461108 different realtors have different styles of work and you have to choose someone with whom you can sit down and express what you want in a house or in the sale of your house
1461109 you need someone who will tell you the truth if youve got a house for sale they have to be able to price it accurately appraise it properly some realtors will give you the number you want to hear to get the listing and thats not good
1461110 buys or sells always says after the fact that they had a great realtor because it reflects on them
1461111 ask them to recommend a realtor in their office who specializes in the particular area you like or drive around that area and look for the realtor whose signs are fairly prolific that means they are focusing on that area
1461112 that way theyll know about competing products prices and trends and will be able to answer buyers questions that wont be evident in listing information
1461113 there are more negotiations taking place in this market than ever before so you really need a realtor with experience in negotiating
1461114 eighty seven percent of buyers are finding the house they buy on the internet
1461115 make sure your realtor is not pulling back on their expenditures to market your home but is pouring their efforts into that end
1461116 ask the realtor to provide you with a comprehensive market analysis that shows you houses in the same neighborhood that have recently sold
1461117 if they dont have these certifications stay away from them because if anything happens during or after the project is completed as a result of their error the homeowner will feel that financial burden
1461118 its the job of the contractor to make sure his work is good and being licensed bonded and insured is the safety net
1461119 deciding to do a home build creates an intimate relationship because your home is where your family is this is not an in and out kind of job it can last months depending on the job so its a relationship that needs a good foundation
1461120 at our store people call us all the time requesting references its a good idea to speak to people who have used your builder or contractor before you sign a contract for new work
1461121 we sign a contract for every single job that comes through our store no matter how small
1461122 the trouble with a guy working out of his home and this is not always true is that his experience may not be broad and experience is the essential element in this process
1461123 you dont have to have a store front but experience is important
1461124 the trouble you get into with a big contractor is they have a package method by which they do things and that method might not work out well for you but a lot of times people find that its easier to get hold of a company than it is to reach a one man company working out of his truck
1461125 if you short yourself on that and dont put enough good soil down none of the roots will take and youll have water issues
1461126 i would choose certain kinds of plants over grass anytime
1461127 you plant them once do some good preparation work on your soil weed mulch and prune twice a year and you have a yard thats a thousand times more interesting than plain lawn with a lawn youll be mowing every week all season long
1461128 combine colors textures heights and different bloom times for added interest and variety
1461129 perennials can be more interesting in terms of variety but sometimes you cant get the look you want with perennials
1461130 for power and constant color all through the summer choose annuals
1461131 we had big piles of laundry on the floor that were dirty and big piles of clean laundry on the counter that ended up not being folded because there was so much of it that there was never enough time
1461132 the ones filled with dirty clothes are taken to the laundry and replaced in the bedrooms with empty baskets
1461133 one of the biggest problems i see is that people dont tend to their laundry they let things pile up for too long so a relatively simple task becomes a monumental one
1461134 limit the number of items you own to simplify your laundry
1461135 you can use simple plastic contraptions or canvas sorters on wheels but you need something for your clean and dirty laundry that you can move around easily
1461136 i have a lamp and a beautiful piece of art in my laundry room
1461137 hooks make it easy to hang a coat quickly to dry and ensure you have a place for shoes to gather either a nice big basket or a simple shoe shelf on the floor
1461138 often people purchase the wrong things that dont function well
1461139 investing in the right products is more than half the battle
1461140 by his divine nature christ is simple by his human nature he is complex
1461141 he was created of a mother whom he created he was carried by hands that he formed he cried in the manger in wordless infancy he the word without whom all human eloquence is mute
1461142 bethlehem and golgotha the manger and the cross the birth and the death must always be seen together
1461143 when we celebrate christmas we are celebrating that amazing time when the word that shouted all the galaxies into being limited all power and for love us came to us in the powerless body of a human baby
1461144 the christmas message is that there is hope for a ruined humanity hope of pardon hope of peace with god hope of glory because at the fathers will jesus christ became poor and was born in a stable so that 30 years later he might hang on a cross
1461145 the instructor interacts with students in the classroom and he knows what we need at the dealership so he recommends students he thinks are qualified to meet our need
1461146 with a mentor the student learns the proper ways of doing things how to use equipment how to diagnose a vehicle and also the practical skills like completing service paperwork
1461147 it is a good program that works as long as the kids come in with the right attitude
1461148 i enjoy working here and hopefully after graduation i can go to automotive school and then continue with bmw
1461149 it is an excellent program i enjoy seeing young techs develop and do well it is almost like watching your own kids grow
1461150 if you are looking for rear seat roominess the a6 is the car
1461151 this community for me is my beloved community this is not a money making venture i have been running with this community all my life and when i hear people like george bush talk about the gay community being anti american it makes my blood boil the guy who saved the white house one of the heroes who crashed that plane on 9 11 was gay the rugby player mark bingham who died on united 93 and does bush ever mention that does he f that gay guy saved his lousy ass and this guy who says he prays to god this guy who promotes hate and fear this guy we call our president this guy is the true anti american
1461152 the reserve bank has left the door open to cut rates next month clearly if there were some unforseen events between now and the next board meeting then that would not happen
1461153 but we dont expect that there would be any developments on the data front particularly on the wages front that will be out next week that would stop them cutting rates given the indications that we got from the governors statement
1461154 the risk that the banks wont fully pass on the interest rate moves from the rba is a very strong argument for the rba to be more aggressive
1461155 well my ex finally returned my calls 9 42 monday march 29th
1461156 um hi evan this is her ive gotten several of your messages and um i just want to tell you please dont call me anymore because im finally getting my life back on track and i dont need you to come in and just confuse my whole life and just disturb it so please i would really appreciate it if you would just please dont call me anymore i dont i dont want to talk to you um maybe someday we can be friends when im a little less bitter towards mankind as a whole um but not now thats for sure so just stay away from me
1461157 its not long enough and vaguely portrays my meaning through in inexact language but its what i sent to her
1461158 hey sorry if this letter ends up sounding sad or is really short or anything
1461159 then over christmas break you treated me like a used piece of gum stuck to your shoe
1461160 at any rate you must understand that i didnt leave that message out of hate
1461161 so though i actually do care and would really like to know whats up from time to time and how youre doing if what you need from me is to no longer contact you ill respect your wish as the best thing for you right now and comply
1461162 i hope i expressed myself correctly and didnt forget too much or hurt you any more i never wanted that
1461163 ps my correspondance when im not in person almost always sounds kind of dry and formal sorry
1461164 yeah she responded to my email and though i still cant talk to her anytime soon shes still not hating me or anything and she still loves me
1461165 wenn tats chlich ein mitglied der bundesregierung derart intensiv aggressiv und initiativ h chst sensible gesch fte mit dem iran dem amtierenden weltmeister in sachen antisemitismus erm glicht ist das ein schlimmer skandal der schande der mich emp rt und entsetzt dass der herr staatsekret r sich sogar noch damit ffentlich br stet macht die sache nur noch schlimmer die glaubw rdigkeit der bundesregierung in diesem punkt wird so nachhaltig in frage gestellt
1461166 es ist emp rend dass b rokraten erlaubt wird gesch fte einzuf deln die erkl rten deutschen regierungszielen zuwiderlaufen w rden
1461167 dieses gesch ft welches eiligst eine l cke schlie en w rde die durch den r ckzug einer franz sischen firma entstanden ist hilft dem iran in diesem sensiblen sektor und f hrt die internationalen bem hungen ad absurdum das sich atomar aufr stende regime zu isolieren
1461168 solange die bundeskanzlerin die entscheidung des bafa nicht aufhebt wird deutschland teheran st rken und ein regime weiter ermutigen dessen pr sident immer wieder zur zerst rung des j dischen staates aufruft
1461169 gesch ftsinteressen so scheint es bertrumpfen jegliche verlautbarten sorgen f r israels sicherheit berlins weigerung seine betr chtlichen konomischen druckmittel gegen teheran einzusetzen setzt es nicht nur in widerspruch zu washington sondern auch zu seinen europ ischen partnern in london und paris die nachricht ber den irandeal kommt in einem moment in dem der britische premierminister gordon brown versucht die europ ischen spitzen zu einer ausweitung der sanktionen auf gasverfl ssigungstechnologie zu bewegen und im september hatte paris franz sische firmen dazu gedr ngt nicht auf iranische angebote zu reagieren
1461170 ist nur ein beispiel f r deutschlands weiterhin bl hende gesch ftsbeziehung mit den mullahs richtig die exporte in den iran sind in den letzten jahren zur ckgegangen nicht zuletzt wegen des drucks der usa aber die importe aus dem iran sind letztes jahr um 28 gestiegen und deutsche exporte in den iran steigen wieder um 13 6 im ersten quartal w hrenddessen verbindet sich deutschland zunehmend mit china und russland um der diplomatie noch eine weitere chance zu geben obwohl das iranische regime keine bereitschaft zeigt auf lockende angebote zu reagieren frau merkels rede vor der knesset vor nur vier monaten als historisch betrachtet klingt bereits hohl
1461171 nicht in ihrem sinne es gibt kein interesse seitens der bundesregierung an einer politischen einf delung solch eines gesch ftes
1461172 entscheidung der deutschen regierung dem geist der sanktionen zuwider l uft die der un sicherheitsrat ber den iran verh ngt hat die tatsache dass ausgerechnet deutschland das neben frankreich und gro britannien mitglied der europ ischen f hrungsriege eu3 ist einen standpunkt eingenommen hat der den internationalen trend hin zu einer signifikanten versch rfung der sanktionen gegen die fortsetzung des iranischen atomprogramms untergr bt ist besorgniserregend
1461173 brodelnden diplomatischen streit zwischen deutschland und israel ber die frage einer exportlizenz die einer deutschen firma gew hrt wurde um den iran mit high tech gasanlagen zu beliefern
1461174 die kritik aus israel indes zur ckgewiesen gestern noch prompt petrochemische anlagen fielen nicht unter die sanktionen der vereinen nationen hie es aus berlin die exportgenehmigung f r den heimischen anlagenbauer sei rechtlich einwandfrei und habe nicht verhindert werden k nnen es geht allerdings auch anderes der franz sische total konzern hatte anfang juli ein milliardengesch ft mit dem iran zur erschlie ung der riesigen gasvorkommen wegen der politisch angespannten lage platzen lassen
1461175 nach angaben des bundesamts f r wirtschaft und ausfuhrkontrolle bafa hatte die siegener firma spg steiner prematechnik gastec im februar 2007 einen ersten sogenannten nullbescheid beantragt zwei weitere dann im juni 2007 ein nullbescheid best tigt dass ein gesch ft rechtlich einwandfrei ist obwohl es eigentlich gar nicht genehmigungspflichtig ist das bafa kam ende des dritten quartals 2007 zu dem ergebnis das gesch ft versto e nicht gegen sanktionen der un oder der eu gegen iran auch ist der beh rde zufolge nicht damit zu rechnen dass komponenten der anlage f r milit rische zwecke entfremdet werden k nnten
1461176 insofern w re das iran gesch ft nicht weiter aufgefallen es w re eines unter vielen geblieben mit denen deutsche unternehmen zum beispiel im vergangenen jahr 3 6 milliarden euro umgesetzt haben in aller regel sehr diskret die firmen sind stets sehr zugekn pft wenn es um auftr ge aus iran geht allerdings br sten sich die iranische regierung und die medien des landes gern mit ihren politischen kontakten und gesch ftspartnern im westen der staat vermittelt damit den eindruck das land sei gar nicht isoliert wegen des atomkonfliktes die meldung h tte in deutschland kaum beachtung gefunden wenn sie das irankritische mideast freedom forum berlin nicht sofort aufgegriffen h tte
1461177 das iran gesch ft bleibt aber trotz beh rdlicher bescheide in der grauzone einerseits gelten die gesch ftskontakte nach iran als traditionell gut und versto en in vielen f llen auch nicht gegen sanktionsvorschriften etwa im energiegesch ft andererseits bekennt sich die bundesregierung immer wieder zu ihrem ziel einen bewaffneten konflikt zwischen iran und den usa oder israel wegen des umstrittenen atomprogramms verhindern zu wollen dieses bekenntnis zur diplomatie aber hei t es in berlin setze voraus iran zumindest politisch unter druck zu setzen und das werde nicht gelingen solange firmen ungeniert gesch fte machten
1461178 fdp generalsekret r dirk niebel warf dem parlamentarischen staatssekret r vor er habe lobbyarbeit zugunsten irans betrieben dies habe israel v llig zu recht kritisiert sagte er dem tagesspiegel niebel forderte wirtschaftsminister michael glos csu auf zu dem fall stellung zu nehmen was sagt eigentlich herr glos zu diesem vorgang in seinem haus oder k mmert er sich nur noch um den csu wahlkampf der gr nen bundestagsabgeordnete jerzy montag wies darauf hin dass die von schauerte unterst tzte firma im wahlkreis des staatssekret rs liege das riecht und stinkt nach lobbyismus f r den eigenen beritt und damit in eigener sache sagte er montag warf bundeskanzlerin angela merkel cdu inkonsequenz vor die kanzlerin darf sich nicht in sonntagsreden vor der knesset aufplustern wenn sie dann im entscheidenden moment nicht eingreift meinte er
1461179 die freundschaft zu israel sie ist vor allem ein fall f r sonntagsreden kosten soll sie nichts
1461180 wie es sich mit diesen sanktionen verh lt wurde jedoch gerade erst wieder deutlich als sich herausstellte dass nicht allein das international zu recht daf r kritisierte nachbarland schweiz sein konomisches interesse am iranischen gassektor verstand gegen den geist internationaler sanktionen durchzusetzen sondern auch die deutsche exportindustrie auf leisen sohlen und mit tatkr ftiger unterst tzung von parteigenossen merkels danach strebt verbalakrobatisch das fressen der moral voranzustellen und das nachdem sowohl gro britannien als auch frankreich sch rfere sanktionen gegen den iran im erdgassektor betont haben und auch die schweiz inzwischen abstand von einer sonderrolle in der europ ischen iran politik verk ndet es mag tats chlich richtig sein dass im reinen wortlaut der deal den gegenw rtig von deutschland getragenen sanktionen gegen den iran nicht widerspricht nur stellt sich die frage welchen teil des neins zum iranischen atomprogramm welches gegenstand der sanktionen ist die b rokraten der bafa der herr staatssekret r schauerte und die beflissen auf das wieder wachsende deutsche exportvolumen in den iran schielenden ihk funktion re nicht verstanden haben m gen wie beim allgemein bekannten dilemma der genozid pr vention die immer wieder daran scheitert dass politische akteure sich scheuen v lkermord beim namen zu nennen drohen auch hier politische willensbekundungen wie die verpflichtungen gegen ber der israelischen sicherheit als teil der deutschen staatsr son zu blo en papiertigern zu mutieren der pressesprecher der sich im urlaub befindenden kanzlerin verlautbarte immerhin das gasgesch ft sei nicht in ihrem sinne es bleibt zu hoffen dass nun erw hnte staatsr son m glichst schnell aus dem urlaub geholt wird
1461181 ich unterst tze in jeder hinsicht die politik der bundesregierung den handel mit dem iran so weit wie m glich zu reduzieren so lange der iran sich mit seinem atomprogramm nicht an die internationalen gesetze h lt und israel bedroht
1461182 die botschaft die von diesem gesch ft ausgeht ist sehr negativ
1461183 merkel lehnt das gesch ft ab obwohl gas kein teil der sanktionen gegen den iran bez glich dessen nuklearer aktivit ten ist w rden offizielle stellen das gespr ch mit spg suchen
1461184 everyone is entitled to a fair judge not the judge they want
1461185 i was stunned utterly completely stunned so stunned i couldnt speak even though i was aching to scream to rant to demand an explanation for how he could desert me like this all i could do was repeat over and over in my head dont feel a thing dont feel a thing dont feel a thing
1461186 do not muse at me worthy friend i have a strange infirmity which is nothing to those who know me
1461187 das ist die sterbeurkunde meines vaters ich hatte schon drei familienmitglieder verloren als auch noch meine tochter bei einer explosion starb danach sind wir aus dem irak geflohen
1461188 der irak ist immer noch eines der gef hrlichsten l nder weltweit
1461189 statt menschen in den irak zur ckzuschicken m ssen die europ ischen staaten endlich ihre internationalen verpflichtungen zum fl chtlingsschutz ernst nehmen
1461190 syrien allein hat etwa eine million irakische fl chtlinge aufgenommen ihre lebensbedingungen verschlechtern sich zusehends immer mehr sind auf lebensmittelhilfe angewiesen
1461191 es ist berf llig dass l nder wie deutschland ihren beitrag zur l sung der fl chtlingskrise leisten
1461192 experiments in high tech edutainment engaging students in a media rich popular culture course
1461193 generic intellectual abilities and a broad understanding of the world
1461194 and there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby keeping watch over their flocks at night
1461195 the whole meaning of the christian community lies in offering a space in which we wait for that which we have already seen christian community is the place where we keep the flame alive among us and take it seriously so that it can grow and become stronger in us in this way we can live with courage trusting that there is a spiritual power in us that allows us to live in this world without being seduced constantly by despair loneliness and darkness
1461196 every good and perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of the heavenly lights who does not change like shifting shadows
1461197 behold a virgin shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emanuel which being interpreted is god with us
1461198 therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god
1461199 of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you
1461200 joseph also went up from the town of david because he belonged to the house and line of david he went there to register with mary who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child while they were there the time came for the baby to be born and she gave birth to her firstborn a son she wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn
1461201 during the first world war on christmas eve the battlefield was strangely quiet as the soft snow fell the thoughts of the young men were of home and their families softly one lad began to hum silent night wheezy tenors and throaty baritones took up the chorus until the trenches resounded with the christmas song when they finished singing they were astonished to hear the song echoing from the trenches across land in their own tongue the other soldiers also sang silent night that night they were thinking of the prince of peace the christ of christmas
1461202 magazine its the december 2007 edition my mom subscribes to it and ive been visiting my mom so thanks mom for helping me out here

1461206 father forgive us our christmases as we forgive those who christmas against us
1461207 for you know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that you through his poverty might become rich

1461273 letting go through intolerance and apathy one thing i have said over and over for several years is that the higher realms are not what you might think much of what we have been taught or read about is highly inaccurate although this is not a simple process basically it all boils down to simplicity and how energy responds and interacts with itself there are higher and lower forms of vibrating energy creating things that feel good and things that do not so then there is no meaning to anything meaning is simply what we choose to place on any particular manifestation some things may feel good to one person according to how they interpret them and may feel very unpleasant to another a rule of thumb then might be that things either feel good or they feel bad its that simple as we begin to vibrate higher and higher we become less and less of a match to what has been created so far on this planet and also to any lower vibrating aspects of other human behaviors and realities one might think that as we become more spiritual we embody a great compassion understanding and tolerance at higher levels than we ever have before but this is not the case as we progress through ascension and begin to vibrate higher and higher we find ourselves becoming highly intolerant of any lower vibrating energies we simply cannot be in their presence for very long and we may even become angry and frustrated with them as well there is a method to this madness as mentioned in earlier sections of this book there is a hierarchy to energetic levels and dimensions when we reach higher realities it is very difficult to reside or spend time in the lower realities we are simply not a match to them anymore this response also has other benefits the intolerance greatly encourages us to create more on the outside that matches how we are vibrating feeling and being on the inside if our outside reality feels downright awful we will most assuredly be inspired to save ourselves through our need to feel better by creating higher ways of living and being and by not tolerating and refusing to be a part of the old reality as we literally cannot stomach it anymore it makes us literally refuse to participate therefore withdrawing any energy of support if we do not become involved in something and negate it it cannot survive because there is no energy to make it real and alive it will simply cease to be as it will not be residing in anyones consciousness through this intolerance we are also being very direct as we progress into higher vibrating human beings we find that we can no longer beat around the bush sit by and watch or take a long winding road to get anywhere higher energy moves in a straight shot it does not go here and there make excuses and support friends and family even though they are in unhealthy situations or sit blindly by it is simple and direct no wishy washy uncertainty and passivity the time is up for tolerating the old and for waiting its the higher way or no way at some level we know this and at times can find ourselves addressing the lower vibrations very directly in this way this is a higher form of love it involves an inability to support the lower vibrations in anything we are actually being supportive and loving in that we are now supporting the highest ways through this intolerance we are actually being spiritual warriors of higher truth and greatly helping others in the higher realms we create through a partnership with source and as we are becoming more and more of source ourselves we must connect much more deeply now in order to create the higher ways during these years of ascension it can appear that we are getting absolutely nowhere it may seem that nothing ever goes our way or that we are receiving very little support for getting what we want this is really not the case we do not want to create things that are not of a higher vibration or that will no longer fit in the near future in other ways we cannot create from ego in the higher realms when we are not getting what we want it is usually because we wont be in that situation or reality very soon or that we are not yet ready if there is something that you really feel you must have then you are not ready to receive it it is ironic that we always get what we want when we no longer want it what is happening here is that we have lost our attachment which places us in a position for perfect creating in addition we are not then creating from our ego this is all part of the ascension process through it all we can get pretty discouraged at times when we get discouraged and let down over and over again and feel that all our dreams have shattered we become apathetic this is perfect it puts us into a space of letting go we simply do not care anymore this makes us let go and release the energy of attachment we are then residing in neutral energy with no agendas and this allows much more of source to enter and of course allows us to let go of many of the illusions

1461276 there was much of the beautiful much of the wanton much of the bizarre something of the terrible and not a little of that which might have excited disgust
1461277 can you explain why ethical vegans trumpet their cruelty free diets when the fact is that growing storing and transporting their food causes immense pain and suffering to many humans
1461278 please explain to me how eating a vegan lifestyle is not elitist it is very expensive to eat an exclusive vegan diet and even the term lifestyle denotes peoples being apart from with the exception of non american born buddhists most vegans i have met are very arrogant regarding their food choices
1461279 veganism is just another eating disorder just another way for a mentally ill person to have absolute control over everything they eat
1461280 we dont believe any french citizen or other citizen is above the law especially when it comes to crimes as serious as genocide

1461287 the 2007 venezuelan law to protect women from violence is an example for the rest of the region but it will be useless for women unless its fully implemented
1461288 implementation of the law means more shelters special tribunals and training for those who have to deal with these crimes
1461289 thousands of women in venezuela live in a constant state of fear of violence from their partners fear for their lives and the safety of their children when a safety net is not provided many women feel that they have no choice but to stay with their abuser or to be homeless and unable to support themselves or their children
1461290 venezuelas government needs to step up to the challenge set by the 2007 law
1461291 central government have provided us with 590 000 thats nowhere near enough to manage what we normally spend
1461292 it is something in the neighboiurhood of 4m it will cost preston this year

1461300 if we yearned after god even as much as a cow yearns for her calf we would be the worshiping and effective believers god wants us to be if we longed for god as a bride looks forward to the return of her husband we would be a far greater force for god than we are now
1461301 nevertheless i am continually with thee thou has holden me by my right hand thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory

1461307 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1461308 if there is a subtle shift in the risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern

1461323 was tricky part of the coming out process is figuring out who you like and what that means and how to act on it
1461324 being an actor reduced my level of anonymity i couldnt just go to some bar and walk in and ask someone out on a date
1461325 if i had any regret it would be that strange lack of anonymity that created panic within myself that i would be found out

1461339 alles lijkt onzeker te zijn zonder stevige fundering en zonder richting
1461340 ik weet niet meer wie ik ben vroeger kende ik mijn doel en nu ben ik helemaal en compleet verloren
1461341 ik kan op geen enkele manier vooruit ik voel me alsof in een doos
1461342 ik voel me hulpeloos kwetsbaar onzeker en overgeleverd aan de grillen bijna alles
1461343 mijn zelfvertrouwen is weg ik voel me verreweg van goed in mezelf
1461344 ik voel me volledig onzichtbaar onopgemerkt niet nodig en zeker niet gewaardeerd
1461345 ik heb geen zin om iets te doen ik ben nergens in ge nteresseerd ik wil gewoon spelen ik wil me terugtrekken ik wil geen verantwoordelijkheden meer ik ben uitgeput ik moet verjongen ik heb een heel lange rust nodig of misschien een eindeloze vakantie

1461366 our legal counsel is currently reviewing the possible next steps in the litigation and while we are disappointed by the courts decision it has no impact on our day to day operation of the business

1461369 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1461370 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1461371 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1461372 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1461373 we have not yet read the report which has not been sent to us by the rwandan government we are therefore not in a position to react
1461374 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1461375 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1461376 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1461377 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1461378 yum brands operates 35 000 restaurants under the kfc taco bell and pizza hut brands
1461379 they design and create micro power grids that balance power demand and provide automatic control systems
1461380 there are reports from different sources from rights groups that they were rounded up in the run up to the games and they have been sent to a place nobody knows
1461381 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
1461382 he doesnt seem to want to engage in any discourse
1461383 his few responses are non verbal theres very little eye contact occasionally hell nod or shake his head to answer
1461384 when we went there we found an astonishing amount of gorillas
1461385 the secret source of humour itself is not joy but sorrow
1461386 taking the babies a day or two early at this point wont make an enormous difference for them but taking them a day or two late could have huge consequences for you
1461387 the reserve bank has left the door open to cut rates next month clearly if there were some unforseen events between now and the next board meeting then that would not happen
1461388 but we dont expect that there would be any developments on the data front particularly on the wages front that will be out next week that would stop them cutting rates given the indications that we got from the governors statement
1461389 the risk that the banks wont fully pass on the interest rate moves from the rba is a very strong argument for the rba to be more aggressive
1461390 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1461391 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1461392 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1461393 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1461394 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1461395 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1461396 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1461397 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
1461398 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
1461399 their bodies wont be able to tolerate pregnancy and delivering children
1461400 solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
1461401 nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more
1461402 john mccain has taken a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1461403 hes offered a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy
1461404 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1461405 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again hes the original maverick one is ready to lead mccain
1461406 being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1461407 this plan will not lower prices today it will not lower prices during the next administration the truth is we wouldnt see a drop of oil from john mccains plan for at least the next seven years
1461408 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1461409 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more
1461410 i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy
1461411 mit s ovat niin n ss j ett tuovat vaikka kuun taivaalta vaikkei sit olisi edes pyydetty eih n sellaisesta voi kiinnostua

1461416 onpa tosi hienoa kun joku viitsii harrastaa noin kovasti urheilua kun toiset vain vet kaiket illat kaljaa baarissa
1461417 whats the big deal about having such advancements about products in swimming
1461418 there isnt a big deal in other sports we wanted to see michael jordan jump higher is his day we want to see roger federer play better tennis we want to see lance armstrong on a better bike in his heyday
1461419 its just part of the evolution of sport its part of the process if we were staying in the same swimsuits and same sort of competition wear i think it would get a little bit boring
1461420 i think its exciting and its no different to any other sport and im in a position where i have a world record and it would never worry me if it got broken because someone wore a suit its part of spectator sport its enjoyable to watch and its very exciting
1461421 i think the amount of focus that has been placed on the swimsuits has taken away from the performances of the athletes and i hope that we can applaud the performances and not look for other reasons
1461422 swimsuit technology advancement is something we have been doing since we wore full length woollen suits in 1908
1461423 its my understanding that park said he is going to swim under the world record and if he intends to do that hell get a very good result
1461424 the reason its been such a good world record is because it was set by ian thorpe who is a phenomenal swimmer and and i think were still a little bit away from it but well just have to see what will happen
1461425 i guess a lot of the focus is on the 1500 freestyle for me but another good event for me is the 400 and i feel like things are going pretty well
1461426 ive prepared well in that event also but at the same time i make it clear that my focus has been on the 1500
1461427 abbiamo deciso di lasciare la libert di scelta agli imprenditori agricoli senza imporre vincoli a nessuno abbiamo fatto una battaglia in sede comunitaria contro questo provvedimento ritenuto da noi sbagliato e dannoso
1461428 siamo convinti ha proseguito che ai produttori toscani diversamente da quanto potr accadere in altre regioni convenga mantenere i vigneti in produzione e non distruggerli perch le nostre produzioni sono riconosciute e apprezzate sul mercato da noi infatti continuano ad arrivare richieste per realizzare nuovi vigneti acquistando diritti di reimpianto recentemente abbiamo rilasciato questi diritti con un costo ridotto della concessione nelle isole dellarcipelago e allargentario ovviamente si tratta di diritti che per oltre dieci anni sottostanno ad un vincolo di non estirpazione una scelta coerente che risponde allobiettivo di incentivare lo sviluppo della nostra viticoltura che oltre ad un valore economico contribuisce anche ad elevare il pregio ambientale al nostro territorio
1461429 noi riteniamo che quanto deciso dallu e sia sbagliato e assurdo sbagliato perch incoraggia la dismissione di questa attivit anzich incentivarne lo sviluppo e lammodernamento assurdo perch incoraggia la distruzione anzich uno sviluppo qualitativo e dinamico della viticoltura sono convinto che una politica basata sui vincoli non porti grandi frutti n al settore n allagricoltura
1461430 in toscana ha proseguito il presidente saranno i singoli viticoltori in base alla convenienza di impresa a decidere se estirpare i loro vigneti oppure mantenerli in attivit perch conveniente opportuno e logico

1461432 kami mencoba me live kan acara ini sehingga bisa dilihat oleh seluruh dunia melalui teknologi internet hal ini merupakan usaha agar kepariwisataan yogya semakin mengglobal
1461433 kami telah mengeluarkan izin ini kepada telkomsel izinnya adalah dia telkomsel untuk menerbitkan kartu prabayar yang dapat juga digunakan untuk pembayaran pembayaran umum secara it kartu prabayar itu sama dengan kartu debet dan hal ini memungkinkan dan seingat saya dia telkomsel sudah soft launching
1461434 seperti contohnya untuk bayar tol restoran dan sebagainya jadi hanya untuk pembayaran kecil saja jadi perusahaan telekomunikasi yang mengeluarkan kartu pra bayar itu kan juga berisi pulsa yang sejatinya adalah uang
1461435 tapi nanti jika misalkan pulsanya tinggal rp 200 ribu itu bisa di top up lagi
1461436 kita melakukan ini karena tren di luar negeri memang seperti itu dan kita mengeluarkan izin baru kepada telkomsel
1461437 syaratnya ada di pbi 752 seperti bahwa harus mempunyai pengalaman kartu prabayar minimal 2 tahun jadi ini bukan hanya untuk bank saja non bank juga bisa
1461438 karena penggunaan kartu untuk pembayaran masih minim menurut saya jika masyarakat menggunakan kartu untuk pembayaran akan bagus sebab kita tahu bahwa biaya percetakan uang itu mahal

1461455 ive said this before i dont think that nuclear power is a panacea but i also think that given that it doesnt emit greenhouse gases for us to invest some r amp d into seeing whether we can store nuclear waste safely or reuse it these are all areas where the market interacting with a clear set of rules by the federal government and billions of dollars devoted to research and development can i think trigger the kind of economic growth that we havent seen in this country for a long time

1461457 i am for yucca mountain im for storage facilities its a lot better than sitting outside power plants all over america
1461458 i believe that yucca mountain is a suitable place for storage
1461459 i believe that yucca mountain is a suitable place for storage and i know that theres controversy about it and lawsuits and all that but shouldnt america a country as smart and as wise as we are be able to find a place to store spent fuel
1461460 mccain criticized both democrats for their opposition to yucca mountain the political opposition to the yucca mountain storage facility is harmful to the u s interest and the facility should be completed opened and utilized mccain adviser holtz eakin said

1461465 friendster is growing at an enormous rate in asia pacific and is clearly leading the competition i believe this is partly because the internet is transforming the lives of everyone and it will probably become one of the greatest liberators of our time
1461466 with more than 75 million users it is clear that friendster has already made a dramatic impact i look forward to growing our business further as we continue our global growth and strong focus on asia
1461467 with the addition of richard butch and the new funding friendster will continue to expand its worldwide footprint and take advantage of its leadership position in asia pacific
1461468 friendster has kept growing the site fell from grace and everybody gave it up for dead but the asian markets have kept it alive
1461469 now as the leading social network in some of those countries it has a real shot at revenues and perhaps acquisition
1461470 maximize the time our customers spend with us onboard by offering them even more productivity options
1461471 our customers asked for in flight connectivity and were responding by rolling out the most extensive wi fi network in the sky
1461472 made broadband connectivity in the cabin economically viable for the first time for commercial airlines
1461473 business travelers and consumers more broadly would appreciate access to the internet on the plane its going to happen
1461474 with airline customer satisfaction at an all time low this is not the time to consider making airplane travel even more torturous
1461475 as i have to spend most of my day connected anyway ive generally used flights to sort through back work and e mails without the threat of being distracted by new work flooding in or as an opportunity to catch up on reading some dead tree material as such im somewhat ambivalent about the chance to have airborne wi fi
1461476 a lot of people secretly really value the absence of internet access during that time to read a book sleep be free of e mail or just have time to think
1461477 targeted video games can help improve the lives of young people with cancer most importantly improve their adherence to their treatment

1461480 were in danger of seeing the 2008 election stolen again as in 2000 and 2004
1461481 in florida in 2000 and ohio in 2004 we witnessed the obstruction and manipulation of votes by election officials and possible tampering with computer voting machines but equally insidious is the malapportionment of electoral college votes which disenfranchises whole sections of the voting public
1461482 the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the united states is denied or in any way abridged
1461483 if two thirds of the voters in a state vote for a candidate from party a and one third vote for a candidate from party b and the states winner take all rule gives all of the states electors to party a then one third of the voters have been disenfranchised in violation of amendment 14 section 2 of the us constitution
1461484 weve witnessed in election after election how some states have used the winner take all formula to prevent the votes of political ethnic and other minorities from being counted
1461485 alter the fate of the 2008 presidential election in a manner different from any presidential election in the nations history
1461486 by refusing to challenge electoral college malapportionment in 2000 and 2004 which blocked democratic electors from voting in those elections the democratic partys leaders abandoned tens of thousands of their own voters just as they failed to challenge the election irregularities in florida and ohio in 2000 and 2004
1461487 will they fail to challenge malapportionment again in 2008 and hand the republicans another victory barack obama would not be the democratic nominee if not for the democratic partys proportional assignment of primary delegates the winner take all provisions in the general election present the distinct possibility that mr obama in 2008 will win the popular vote by a considerably larger margin than did gore in 2000 but will repeat the democratic loss in the electoral college
1461488 if proportional assignment is considered by democrats to be vital to democracy in their primary elections why wont they fight for it in the general election
1461489 the democratize the electoral college program exposes the hypocrisy and fraud behind charges that the mckinney campaign might spoil the democratic presidential tickets chances of winning democratic leaders should have to explain why they choose to ignore 13 additional electors from southern states that theyd gain through the green partys presidential electors project why is the green party fighting to give voice to democratic voters that the democratic party will not fight for let me be clear were not doing this to assist barack obama but to foster real democracy and voter participation and to offer cynthia mckinney as the truly democratic choice for all the people
1461490 americans dont vote for president instead we vote for an electoral college which was created in the late 1700s to expressly increase the power of the slave states and which it is still doing
1461491 the electors in these southern states arkansas 6 electoral votes georgia 15 electoral votes louisiana 9 electoral votes tennessee 11 electoral votes texas 34 electoral votes are not bound by state law to cast their vote for a specific candidate

1461507 faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen
1461508 not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith
1461509 by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith
1461510 seest thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect
1461511 and he said unto them go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
1461512 for you are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ
1461513 ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only

1461516 for this is the will of god even your sanctification holiness that ye should abstain from fornication for god hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness
1461517 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
1461518 that ye abstain from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well fare ye well
1461519 it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak
1461520 except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses ye cannot be saved
1461521 therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight
1461522 if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain
1461523 this only would i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh
1461524 as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him

1461541 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1461542 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime

1461547 real ale is a natural living product so there is a much greater intensity of flavours
1461548 one of our objectives is to get people to try it there are fruit beers wheat beers porters stouts milds and golden ales its incredibly diverse so theres something to meet everyones tastes
1461549 pasteurising and filtering a beer kills off a lot of the natural flavours

1461565 the problem has been exacerbated by the graduate exodus of pharmaceutic companies from antibiotic development a trend that began in the 1980s and has accelerated since 2000 in large part because the market is iffy and the chances of success are slim
1461566 even though the market for antibiotics is in the neighborhood of 25 billion a year says steve projan vice president of biological technologies at wyeth research in cambridge massachusetts other drugs such as antidepressants or antihypertensives offer a greater bang for the buck because they are often taken for years of decades rather than just a 7 to 14 day course
1461567 whats more the better the antibiotic the less health experts want to see it used to avoid the development of resistance
1461568 we are delighted to have both alan and mark on board with ireland
1461569 both of them are extremely strong technical coaches in their areas and i think they will bring a further positive mix to the coaching team and squad
1461570 alan brings with him experience of both international and most importantly irish rugby
1461571 mark is recognised as one of the top kicking coaches in the world and his experience of working with the squad in the past will help with the transition over the next number of weeks

1461574 we have had some frustrations and roadblocks in our current situation at sydney olympic park
1461575 it certainly hasnt transpired as we would have hoped were looking at a range of options going forward
1461576 the strength of our results did surprise us though i think it shows that the childrens television standards should be updated to take that strength of community views into account
1461577 parents really feel strongly about their children seeing so much junk food advertising so they are really supportive of the government doing more in this area
1461578 there is pretty much no limit to the type of food which is being advertised
1461579 maa analysis has found the average best rate prices across the state will increase by about seven per cent for the family sedan
1461580 his departure from australia to play rugby union has caused a lot of ink to flow sold a lot of papers and allowed a lot of australian supporters to release their pent up frustrations by mail but the facts are there sonny bill williams is well and truly a toulon player for the 2008 09 season with an option of one year
1461581 about the extent to which she abramoff and griles communicated
1461582 very shortly to give each country enough time to consider it ahead of their august 21 22 meeting high placed sources said
1461583 but this was mainly an issue of semantics these sources said
1461584 we are in a desperate race against time in pursuit of prevention that works
1461585 weve known for some time that the expansion of coverage with haart antiretroviral therapy could help to reduce the number of new infections
1461586 however we were amazed at the actual number of new infections that can be potentially averted by expanding access to treatment
1461587 oil prices today are getting hammered on more signs that point to demand destruction
1461588 it appears that the weak economic numbers coming out of the uk will put pressure on the eurozone to worry more about growth and less about inflation and perhaps cut interest rates
1461589 rising supplies from opec are making participants painfully aware that deteriorating economic activity is making less and less of a call on stockpiles
1461590 we can see clearly that these forces are trying to wage a psychological and violent battle against the olympics
1461591 they want to turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning for china
1461592 for these two people it is very clear that they are part of violent terrorist forces
1461593 we stay in our bedrooms and the dining rooms not in the open

1461596 say there will be a response but that clarification is needed on certain points of the offer
1461597 theyve hit the ball back we must analyse whether its just another way to gain time or if its serious
1461598 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1461599 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1461600 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1461601 they have a very weak economy at this point which depends almost entirely on their oil revenue

1461608 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1461609 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1461610 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1461611 they clearly requested that the interahamwes contine to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1461612 we have not yet read the report which has not been sent to us by the rwandan government we are therefore not in a position to react
1461613 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1461614 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1461615 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1461616 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1461617 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice

1461637 equally consistent with the financial results has been our application of a conservative reserving philosophy our historical pattern of reserving at the upper end of the actuarial range even during periods of favorable claim patterns has lead to recurring favorable quarterly reserve adjustments a pattern that should continue to repeat given the current claims environment our overall reserves for all reporting periods remain at the upper end of the range after recognizing 8 6 million of favorable development during the quarter just ended our accounting policy for investments has been no less conservative we have no auction rate securities or sub prime mortgage securities but have been writing our lowest rated alt a mortgage backed securities down to market due to the extended mortgage crisis even with these adjustments total cash and marketable securities has grown to over 225 million

1461653 celebrate the lords ascension to his throne and announce the inauguration of a new phase of his reign with the acclamation the lord has become king
1461654 when he takes the throne of his kingdom he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law taken from that of the priests who are levites 19 it is to be with him and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the lord his god and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees
1461655 psalms 1 and 2 were not read as two disparate torah and royal psalms respectively in the final redaction of the psalter rather both depict the ideal joshua like warrior and king who through divinely given authority vanquishes his enemies from this eschatological perspective the psalter opens and sets the tone for all subsequent psalms

1461659 extrabiblical creation stories from the ancient near east are usually poetic but gen 1 is not typical hebrew poetry indeed some writers endeavoring to underline that gen 1 is pure priestly theology insist that it is not poetry at all on the other hand gen 1 is not normal hebrew prose either its syntax is distinctively different from narrative prose cassuto loretz and kselman have all pointed to poetic bicola or tricola in gen 1 while admitting that most of the material is prose it is possible that these poetic fragments go back to an earlier form of the creation account though as cassuto observes it is simpler to suppose the special importance of the subject led to an exaltation of style approaching the level of poetry gen 1 is unique in the old testament it is elevated prose not pure poetry in its present form it is a careful literary composition introducing the succeding narratives
1461660 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
1461661 because it had not rained a study of gen 2 5 7 with implications for gen 2 4 25 and gen 1 1 2 3

1461675 we are maintaining our 2008 earnings target at a range of 1 60 to 1 70 per share
1461676 those targets assume 2008 capital expenditures of about 265 million on the rodemacher project including afudc normal weather for the remainder of the year and the continuation of our current rate plan cleco midstream earnings targets assume continued performance by evangelines tolling counterparty and are based on assumptions about acadias plant operations and market conditions

1461678 our rodemacher unit 3 project is on schedule to meet its original commercial operations date of october 2009 and could possibly be on as early as june 30 2009 as evidenced by the amendment of the epc contract with shaw

1461704 okay here we go im about to get my first badge
1461705 yeah my clothes are old but i can buy new clothes and youll still be dumber than me
1461706 from day one theres been the potential the talented ability
1461707 the win against wales suggests were hitting our best but there were areas where we didnt achieve success
1461708 the teams been going very well but we can go a lot higher were right on the edge of peforming
1461709 south africa are the form team of the tournament well have to be on our game theres no doubt about that
1461710 fiji play on confidence and they came out of the wales game high on confidence the guys are very pleased at where theyre at
1461711 we celebrated the win against wales for two days but as the sun rose yesterday tuesday we started a new campaign which could mean three more games of football
1461712 the guys appear very hungry theres a belief and confidence there that will grow stronger
1461713 were playing an opposition everyone has respect for south africa are a quality side with a skill set that allows them to play a range of football
1461714 we have the skill set to put other teams under pressure but the one thing weve suffered with at this world cup is that we have to increase our ability to take the pressure off ourselves
1461715 the set piece area is improving but its not ideal
1461716 we take a strong defensive ethic into the game to apply pressure on the opposition and spook the attack
1461717 a lot of training is game based and looks at instinctive play if there are small opportunities well look to maximise them
1461718 itd be lovely to have parity in territory and possession but that hasnt happened
1461719 australian rugby is very structured and its taken that mould over the last five or six years
1461720 fiji rugby is just refreshing we dont put any restraints on the players
1461721 there are times when youd prefer them to play conservative test match rugby but we cant suffocate the players
1461722 rugby for me is a question of science and art the forwards contributing to the former while the backs are the artists
1461723 we have to put food on the table we dont inherit things we learn that working together is important if you work on your own it is hard to come through back in the village if someone is building a house you wont sit there and watch you go and help most of us still live in extended families
1461724 they were saying chill out man weve got six minutes left
1461725 and these were the young guys i could see by their eyes that they were up for it and that hasnt always been the case ive been in a few teams over the years when i could feel the boys had gone we talk about fijis warrior spirit but it hasnt always been there
1461726 our basic skills arent as honed as some of the professional guys
1461727 but if you chuck a ball at their feet theyll pick it up one handed and run 100 metres its something i marvel at my job in fiji is so easy because there are props who are saying give me the ball give me the ball and when i do i simply stand back and watch them go when im playing pro rugby round the world ive got to call a move because theres no flair forwards are running round saying what do we do now or ive got backs who cant pass off their weaker hand
1461728 it was really old school if there was something wrong with the scrum the response was push harder and it worked to a degree but modern rugby requires greater concentration on technique and thats what were learning now im learning stuff from people who play rugby out of books weve now got guys who are pushing weights before we had big muscly guys but they werent strong in endurance terms there is a new generation of forwards coming through who know where their place is on the pitch a decade ago the props used to pop up on the wing because thats where the tries are
1461729 before fijian rugby gets better before the money comes on to the island to improve infra structure fiji itself has to improve i dont see the point in financing the rugby fraternity when the health service is so poor fiji is a third world country it needs to pick itself up we cant have rugby players getting more money than doctors or teachers to me that doesnt add up
1461730 like when you write out the amount on a check

1461742 what then is this vindication this dikaiosis it is gods declaration that a person is in the right that is a that their sins have been forgiven and b that they are part of the single covenant family promised to abraham notice that opening phrase gods declaration that not gods bringing it about that but gods authoritative declaration of what is in fact the case we now discover that this declaration this vindication occurs twice it occurs in the future as we have seen on the basis of the entire life a person has led in the power of the spirit that is it occurs on the basis of works in pauls redefined sense and near the heart of pauls theology it occurs in the present as an anticipation of that future verdict when someone responding in believing obedience to the call of the gospel believes that jesus is lord and that god raised him from the dead this is the point about justification by faith to revert to the familiar terminology it is the anticipation in the present of the verdict which will be reaffirmed in the future justification is not how someone becomes a christian it is gods declaration about the person who has just become a christian and just as the final declaration will consist not of words so much as of an event namely the resurrection of the person concerned into a glorious body like that of the risen jesus so the present declaration consists not so much of words though words there may be but of an event the event in which one dies with the messiah and rises to new life with him anticipating that final resurrection in other words baptism i was delighted yesterday to discover that not only chrysostom and augustine but also luther would here have agreed with me

1461924 mccain has fought one battle after another against lobbyists and special interests
1461925 john mccain has fought for 14 long hard years for reforms that seriously limit lobbyists power he has fought for campaign finance reform limits on gifts and travel from lobbyists and extensive public disclosure of lobbyists activities all of which limit the influence of lobbyists and the companies that hire lobbyists in washington d c
1461926 one thing overlooked in flap over mccain and lobbyists his record on reform
1461927 ten years ago senator john mccain took on the tobacco industry saying he would never back down from legislation to regulate the industry mccains decade of work on tobacco one of the most significant efforts of his congressional career has earned him enmity from the industry and from some fellow republicans over the years
1461928 in 1998 mccain championed anti smoking legislation that faced furious opposition from the tobacco lobby mccain guided the legislation through the senate commerce committee on a 19 1 vote but then the tobacco companies struck back they hired 200 lobbyists and spent 40 million in advertising three times as much as the harry and louise health care reform ads many of the ads attacked mccain by name accusing him of becoming a big government liberal after weeks of bitter debate the bill died on the senate floor
1461929 at a press conference today sen olympia j snowe r maine introduced breakthrough bipartisan consensus prescription drug reimportation legislation the pharmaceutical market access and drug safety act with sens byron dorgan d nd john mccain r az ted kennedy d ma tom daschle d sd trent lott r ms and debbie stabenow d mi
1461930 mccain said he wanted the government to be able to negotiate lower drug prices and import cheaper drugs from canada both ideas that were adamantly opposed by industry lobbyists and which ultimately failed
1461931 the most public front was active last week with the senate passing a bill intended to make it easier for cheap generic drugs to come onto the market the bill sponsored by sens charles schumer d n y and john mccain r ariz drew considerable support in congress and strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry
1461932 in 2002 mccain capped his long push for campaign finance reform by passing the mccain feingold act people can argue about the effectiveness of the act but one thing is beyond dispute it was a direct assault on lobbyist power and earned mccain undying enmity among many important parts of the republican coalition who felt their soft money influence was being diminished
1461933 exposed billions of dollars of waste and layers of contracting irregularity
1461934 in 2004 mccain launched a frontal assault on the leasing contract the pentagon had signed with boeing for aerial refueling tankers mccains investigation exposed billions of dollars of waste and layers of contracting irregularity
1461935 in 2005 mccain led the congressional investigation into the behavior of the lobbyist jack abramoff the investigation was exceedingly unpleasant for republicans because it exposed shocking misbehavior by important conservative activists
1461936 americans are right to be offended when extravagant ceo salaries and severance deals bear no relation to their companys success or shareholders wishes as president john mccain will see that wrongdoing of this kind is called to account by federal prosecutors under his reforms all aspects of a ceos pay including severance arrangements must be approved by shareholders
1461937 a leader we can believe in to help small businesses
1461938 the task force will aggressively investigate potential criminal wrongdoing in the mortgage industry and bring to justice any who violated the law the doj task force will offer assistance to state attorney generals who are investigating abusive lending practices
1461939 congress already has several investigations underway to examine this kind of wagering in our energy markets unrelated to any kind of productive commerce because it can distort the market drive prices beyond rational limits and put the investments and pensions of millions of americans at risk john mccain believes that where we find abuses they need to be swiftly punished to make sure it never happens again we must reform the laws and regulations governing the oil futures market so that they are just as clear and effective as the rules applied to stocks bonds and other financial instruments
1461940 this bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country the handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for people of arizona i cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency security and energy independence

1461987 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1461988 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities

1462054 when i started in 1967 we were basically 10 states plus the u
1462055 i think you saw the connection where there was this large puerto rican population in many of the eastern states particularly new york pennsylvania connecticut and new jersey plus a lot of federal services to puerto rico came out of new york city federal regions so we added puerto rico

1462417 unlike the other products we offer the virtual server replication solution will not be hardware based and will provide all the back end solutions like networking and power needed to ensure data is kept safely
1462418 basically our customers need to tell us how many servers theyd like to replicate and well work with our agents to replicate the data to our virtual targets
1462419 we turned to virtualization because our data center faces a constant need to add more servers while also being limited by the physical space available without expensive expansion
1462420 while it took us one year to get our high availability site up and running sungard came in and had our virtual recovery site ready to go in three weeks
1462421 there are a larger number of companies in the disaster recovery space that are implementing solutions like this and i think the key driver is disaster recovery not server consolidation
1462422 this is a positive move for sungard but lets not forget that its not the only company working on virtual disaster recovery solutions
1462423 server consolidation and virtualization are in the same breath now because of roi but the real benefit aside from saving a little money on virtualization is that suddenly disaster recovery solutions are becoming independent and can be used on any server hardware anywhere
1462424 this is what companies like sungard and its competition are moving towards and what makes this product just the first step in many more to come

1462440 with the finger you can get to places you just cant reach with a handkerchief keeping your nose far cleaner and eating the dry remains of what you pull out is a great way of strengthening the bodys immune system
1462441 medically it makes great sense and is a perfectly natural thing to do in terms of the immune system the nose is a filter in which a great deal of bacteria are collected and when this mixture arrives in the intestines it works just like a medicine

1462455 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1462456 obamas race baiting tactics are nothing new he unfairly charged both president bill clinton and geraldine ferraro of racism during the primary and then worked to spin the story to make himself the victim
1462457 obamas statements about race include a subliminal threat branding all white people who oppose him as racists while at the same time appealing to african americans empathy as a victim of racism these tactics are underhanded and i applaud mccain for exposing the senators hypocrisy
1462458 it is clear that manufacturers are now being hit hard by muted domestic demand weakening activity in key export markets elevated energy and commodity prices and tight credit conditions
1462459 combined with the construction and manufacturing pmi data the services survey confirms that private sector growth has practically ground to a halt at the start of the third quarter with the rate of expansion only very marginal at best
1462460 the contraction will be in the order of magnitude of minus one per cent
1462461 bear in mind though that this is partly a correction after the exceptionally good first quarter
1462462 i was expecting growth this year of 2 3 per cent
1462463 but if this second quarter figure is confirmed i will probably end up below 2 per cent

1462477 im glad that he stepped up to this but lets be clear he doesnt have any support in his own party yet for this and unless he can get republicans to agree with his point of view we could be here for an extended period of time
1462478 they republicans are very narrow about what they want to discuss and even more narrow on the things theyre willing to agree to so we are now at loggerheads this is an impasse there are no four way discussions going on any longer because there are no solutions here

1462513 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1462514 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law

1462582 the bush administration estimates that expanded offshore drilling could increase oil production by 200 000 barrels per day by 2030 we use about 20 million barrels per day so that would meet about 1 of our demand two decades from now meanwhile efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage by 3 and regular maintenance can add another 4 many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone else did we could reduce demand several percentage points immediately in other words obama is right the real problem with the attacks on his tire gauge plan is that efforts to improve conservation and efficiency happen to be the best approaches to dealing with the energy crisis the cheapest cleanest quickest and easiest ways to ease our addiction to oil reduce our pain at the pump and address global warming its a pretty simple concept if our use of fossil fuels is increasing our reliance on middle eastern dictators while destroying the planet maybe we ought to use less
1462583 the mccain camp is trying to make the tire gauge a symbol of unseriousness as if only the most foolish of americans believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil without doing the bidding of big oil but the tire gauge is really a symbol of a very serious piece of good news we can use significantly less energy without significantly changing our lifestyle
1462584 as it turns out the speaker of the house of representatives has instructed house democrats whose seats are hotly contested this november to publicly oppose her stance on domestic offshore drilling in order to get elected one presumes that said representatives would resume opposition to drilling after theyve successfully hoodwinked their constituents been re elected this shows that pelosi knows that shes going against the will of the people she does not care however because she has a higher calling in her own words shes trying to save the planet apparently the messiah syndrome is quite the contagious disease what i want to know is this are nancy pelosis actions in this matter in line with the job description of the speaker of us house of representatives is it her job to save the world if it is is she supposed to do it by bringing the economy of her country to ruin

1462830 zum problem werden um glaubw rdig f r eine b rgerliche koalition zu werben
1462831 ich kann diese pauschalkritik von herrn schlarmann so nicht akzeptieren
1462832 wir k nnen in einer gro en koalition nicht cdu pur machen herr schlarmann sollte kein sommerloch thema aufmachen sondern lieber mithelfen dass wir n chstes jahr die bundestagswahl gewinnen und mit der fdp ein b ndnis eingehen k nnen
1462833 leipzig muss f r uns richtschnur sein und ist es auch es ist aber auch klar dass wir diese programmatik mit der spd nicht eins zu eins umsetzen k nnen
1462834 i have to be at work in 45 minutes and all i wanted was to study
1462835 den hohen anspr chen bei dieser operation am offenen herzen
1462836 ich bin in einem linken kosmos gro geworden der dann irgendwann zusammenbrach
1462837 was mich im studium aber besonders gest rt hat war die undiszipliniertheit im seminar
1462838 es wurden schon damals keine guten hochschullehrer gesucht die profs lie en die leute im seminar reden wie ihnen der schnabel gewachsen war und sprachen selbst unverst ndlich
1462839 geachtet wurde nur auf das was jemand fachwissenschaftlich geleistet hat und so war der unterricht dann auch langweilig und lieblos
1462840 ich habe die kunst gelernt mich so verst ndlich wie m glich auszudr cken
1462841 offensichtlich kennen die herren ber 50 so was wie telefonkonferenzen oder e mail nicht
1462842 der umkehrschluss dass wasser mit mehr als zwei mikrogramm uran pro liter sch dlich ist ist nicht zul ssig
1462843 der uranwert liegt bei durchschnittlich 0 4 mikrogramm pro liter wasser
1462844 es gibt keine auff lligkeiten und erst recht keinen grund zur besorgnis
1462845 die strahlungsaktivit t spielt aus gesundheitlicher sicht erst ab ungef hr 60 mikrogramm je liter eine rolle
1462846 wenn ein brunnen zuf llig in ein solches nest abgeteuft wurde kann ein nahe gelegener anderer bereits gering belastet sein

1462848 how much trade in for my xt250 on this grizzly 700
1462849 you tell me how much its worth and ill tell you if its good enough
1462850 from here its worth 500 and im really busy so just tell me what you want for it and save us all a lot of time
1462851 the price of the grizzly 700 is 12 990 its on special im not really interested in trading your bike
1462852 that was a good deal and i would gladly do business with them again
1462853 i enjoyed doing that piece of business and i would appreciate more customers just like them
1462854 es evidente que la familia ol mpica tiene sus propias normas que hay que respetar
1462855 pero una cosa es su manera de pensar ha precisado y otra que no se respeten las normas fijadas en esta materia
1462856 no quiero hablar m s de esto el caso est cerrado es jugador del manchester united y se ha terminado jugar la pr xima temporada con nosotros cr anme
1462857 supimos sobreponernos a todos los inconvenientes incluyendo la traici n de tres atletas
1462858 lo antes posible con el plantel conocer al entrenador y a los nuevos compa eros a todo lo que rodea el clima del equipo
1462859 siempre viene uno con una ilusi n grande ya tengo tres ascensos y espero en lo personal ese cuarto
1462860 vengo a sumar y a aportar mi experiencia cuantos m s jugadores haya mejor pero siempre el equipo est antes que nada
1462861 estoy feliz de observar a una delegaci n mexicana unida cantando el himno nacional con mucho nimo para que el mundo se enter de que aqu est m xico en los juegos ol mpicos
1462862 es una vivencia diferente que la de hace cuatro a os por todo lo que envuelve a mi carrera deportiva en atenas 2004 no tuve la oportunidad de disfrutar este momento ahora todo es diferente porque llego con posibilidades reales de un buen resultado
1462863 tuve un retraso en mi vuelo pero por fortuna estuve en la ceremonia de izamiento de la bandera mexicana todos tienen una gran vibra y eso me llena de emoci n
1462864 mis posibilidades de obtener un buen resultado y porque no pensar en la medalla ol mpica
1462865 es triste decir despedirse de un club que me deja tan buenos recuerdos sin embargo ahora empieza una nueva etapa de mi carrera el olympiacos es el l der del f tbol griego y juega habitualmente la liga de campeones creo que aqu mejorar como jugador
1462866 ra l arias ha hecho de san luis un equipo protagonista con su estilo de juego y sabe parar a su equipo mientras que galindo tiene un a o con nosotros por lo que se trata de dos equipos que tienen bien definida su estrategia
1462867 va a proponer y a ser inteligente a no regalar nada y siempre con la idea de ir al frente a tratar de ganar los partidos
1462868 pero cruz azul est tranquilo y creo que ha trabajado bien los pocos d as que tuvimos para preparar este partido y si jugamos de la misma manera que contra atlas podremos salir con los tres puntos
1462869 a lo largo de los pr ximos d as hasta la llegada de los corredores a granada
1462870 la presencia de productos prohibidos transfusiones sangu neas la presencia de la hormona del crecimiento el uso de epo y espec ficamente el de epo cera
1462871 ning n deporte ni prueba ha puesto en marcha m s elementos para este esfuerzo que los que pone el ciclismo y la vuelta a espa a
1462872 somos dos equipos diferentes tenemos otra manera a la velocidad para contrarrestar su manera de juego es un equipo din mico que juega bien al futbol entonces vamos a tener que estar atentos con concentraci n y orden
1462873 sepsi una de las principales esperanzas del f tbol rumano podr de esta manera ganar experiencia jugando con mayor regularidad en un club destacado y en un campeonato competitivo
1462874 el benfica no dejar de acompa ar de forma atenta la evoluci n de este jugador
1462875 el grupo tiene que entender que un partido se puede definir en una pelota parada y en eso vamos a trabajar mucho sobretodo en concientizar a los futbolistas
1462876 voy a trabajar mucho esta semana en lo t ctico para que el equipo se sienta c modo el domingo los que se adapten mejor para el partido los voy a poner
1462877 el va a parar todo el tiempo que sea necesario hasta que est al cien por ciento porque as como est no puede rendir ni aqu ni en selecci n
1462878 kids hit their feet their hands and thats mostly when they are playing around
1462879 parents pediatricians coaches lifeguards and trainers need to be aware of the types of injuries seen during recreational and competitive diving as well as the risk factors
1462880 given concerns about potential harmful effects and lack of evidence proving that these medications are effective in young children the fact that one in ten u s children is using one of these medications is striking
1462881 we will work closely with all regulatory agencies involved to improve testing protocols and to ensure that the lines of communication remain open in order to continue to protect the public health

1462889 i feel like im being pulled in so many directions
1462890 she was not a top shelf recruit in terms of visibility hebert said
1462891 she was kind of hidden away in a small club she was terrific just not a heavy ink kind of recruit
1462892 we spotted her in a tournament in northern california and i didnt see her until the winter of 1997
1462893 it was pretty clear right away she was a spectacular athlete she could really jump and hit the ball and that was about it i knew she could become something special i just didnt know whether anything like this could have been expected
1462894 first of all its just two people so youre responsible for 50 percent of the court she said
1462895 the beach crowd is a little more easy going and you hire your own coach so you have a lot more control over training and strategy
1462896 and you are really linked to your partner you spend a lot of time together
1462897 ive been so fortunate to pair with holly and ey branagh said
1462898 theyve both been great to learn from ey asked me to play with her at the end of our season it was a good opportunity
1462899 i dont like the whole breakup thing i dont like that at all i was new so i hadnt done much of that breaking up with the partner dumping or whatever you want to call it
1462900 it was very hard for me but at the end of the day i learned that its a business and you make a friendship and you commit a lot of time together but at the end of the day it is a business and this was the best decision for me
1462901 one of the reasons i wanted to play with nicole is shes really athletic really physical moves really well i thought playing alongside someone who attacks and hits the way i do would be a great advantage
1462902 we had a good year so were fortunate enough to be able to call this a job branagh said
1462903 were not making millions like nba players but were doing what we love and focusing on growing beach volleyball
1462904 home sand advantage and the preeminent u s team of kerri walsh and misty may treanor

1462916 todas las adversidades presentadas en el desarrollo del mundial juvenil de b isbol
1462917 supimos sobreponernos a todos los inconvenientes incluyendo la traici n de tres de sus atletas
1462918 edmonton se ha convertido en un basurero los atletas cubanos fueron mal atendidos tiene el privilegio de ser sede anual del campeonato debiera analizarse si vale la pena asistir
1462919 este ltimo partido ser importante para ver c mo llegaremos a espa a tras sacar conclusiones positivas de esta gira por venezuela
1462920 un futbolista llamado a ser gran figura del f tbol mundial
1462921 mas all de venir a prepararnos para la temporada y jugar contra un equipo americano estamos aqu para contribuir en lo que podamos a difundir este mensaje para que todos tomemos conciencia y poco a poco erradicar esta terrible enfermedad que padecen sobre todo ni os y mujeres embarazadas en africa
1462922 es la primera vez que trabajamos con un equipo de f tbol
1462923 no estar a de acuerdo con lo que entendemos debe funcionar
1462924 no hay duda de que podremos aclarar pronto la cuesti n
1462925 lo que pas es una verdadera verg enza y nosotros vamos a apoyar lo que decida el tribunal de penas
1462926 pasaron cosas graves y los responsables tendr n que asumir las consecuencias
1462927 me siento con muchas ganas de participar no es lo mismo ver los partidos desde fuera que estar dentro de la cancha vivi ndolos y siempre con la intenci n de ayudar y aportar mi granito de arena al equipo para seguir buscando buenos resultados
1462928 el equipo est muy bien con ganas de seguir haciendo las cosas como hasta ahora de seguir teniendo un mejor paso y seguir mostrando la solidez de los dos primeros encuentros
1462929 sigue trabajando con la intenci n de seguir mostrando ese rendimiento aunque creo que todav a hay algunos aspectos por pulir
1462930 siempre es bueno comenzar con el pie derecho y se gan que es lo importante sabemos que estamos por buen camino pero somos conscientes de que esto apenas comienza y falta un largo trecho por recorrer y hay que ir paso a paso para que no haya sorpresas
1462931 no estoy en contra de ellos siempre y cuando vengan a aportar al equipo ellos son un complemento hacen una labor de equipo y es bueno que vayan y sientan la camiseta
1462932 seguramente ser una competencia muy dura y equilibrada donde nos conocemos bastante quienes vamos a participar porque hemos coincidido en otras ocasiones por ejemplo en el mundial de manchester
1462933 son varios los que pueden aspirar a ganar medallas habr que ver qui n est en su d a afortunado pero entre los rivales duros est n los representantes de argentina espa a e inglaterra
1462934 hice una buena preparaci n con punto final en europa para competir en el mejor nivel y evitar el fr o de uruguay
1462935 tengo mucha ilusi n de hacer una buena competencia y dejar en alto el prestigio de uruguay
1462936 hemos hablado de cantidades de voluntades es un asunto nica y exclusivamente entre el jugador y nosotros el jugador quiere quedarse en valencia y nosotros queremos que se quede
1462937 si estamos hablando de cantidades es porque estamos intentando acercar posturas estamos m s cerca que antes de la reuni n porque deseamos que se quede en valencia se quede contento
1462938 tanto por parte club como del jugador el deseo es continuar aqu y os hemos emplazado para dentro de ocho d as la semana que viene creo que habr una soluci n a este tema
1462939 estamos donde estamos no podemos decir mucho mas creo que nos hemos dado un tiempo para pensar mejor en las cosas
1462940 citi field ser un lugar fant stico para los mets en las pr ximas d cadas pero los fans siempre recordar n el shea stadium y algunos momentos m gicos
1462941 los beatles ofrecieron su primer concierto en el shea en 1965 y qu mejor clausura 43 a os despu s que un concierto de billy joel y paul mccartney
1462942 es importante mantener el cero atr s y que no nos metan gol tener cuidado con las pelotas paradas y estar m s concentrados en medio pues estamos seguros que arriba se podr n concretar las ocasiones de gol que se tengan
1462943 tenemos que hacer las cosas como las hemos estado haciendo con esfuerzo y dedicaci n sabemos que si lo conseguimos no va a pasar nada y podremos salir con otro resultado positivo
1462944 creo que hay dos partidos importantes y tenemos que ganarlos para que nos vayamos tranquilos a espa a y hacer un buen trabajo all pero primero est el de ma ana y hay que salir concentrados para ganarlo
1462945 es un equipo que juega bien y es muy competente tiene lo suyo de mediocampo hacia arriba pero nosotros vamos con la mentalidad de hacer lo nuestro y sacar el resultado para seguir en lo m s alto de nuestro grupo
1462946 es un torneo importante en el que jugaremos ante un rival importante muy duro que tiene las mismas expectativas que nosotros
1462947 si queremos estar para cosas importantes y lograr algo importante debemos seguir con la local a que tenemos hacer nuestro juego y tratar de pasar al rival por arriba
1462948 as revolutionaries you are hysterics who demand a new master you will get one
1462949 internationally the 68 protests changed the character of post war politics helped end the vietnam war and legitimized concerns about peace welfare and democracy beyond the prevailing mainstream consensus

1462974 when they moved to northwestern it all seemed to fall into place
1462975 tarkanian was excited he told me im so proud of you id never heard him say that before

1462984 we dont want to end up like michigan last year losing to app state weve got to learn from their mistake
1462985 to claim that many national championships among your group of coaches its kind of intimidating sometimes i guess
1462986 once again any given nine think theyre going to play in a conference championship
1462987 i dont know if you see that anywhere else in america
1462988 id trade the heisman for a national championship any day of the week
1462989 it was a dream come true to win the heisman but it doesnt compare to a national championship
1462990 youve got 16 games so youre going to have to have your whole team with you for those 16 games
1462991 if a guy breaks the team rules whatever those team rules are you have to punish him accordingly
1462992 he cant look at it say well if i suspend my best player were going to lose a couple of games maybe he cant look at it like that
1462993 im nobodys judge we put that in coach foxs hands
1462994 we let him make the decision whats happened happened and were moving on from there
1462995 every day hes going to have to get the pulse of the team making sure guys are feeling good and talking to him
1462996 hes got to make sure this thing gets squashed you cant act like it didnt happen thats the worst thing to do
1462997 its going to take some time for the rest of the guys to feel steve as a leader again
1462998 steves got to come back and prove that hes got to prove that was an incident that happened out of anger and out of character
1462999 thats going to be his deal let me prove to the team that im really sorry for what ive done and i really want to come back and help this football team win games
1463000 i was in witness protection last year im out now
1463001 i can come out and do my thing a little bit and have fun with this team because this team is a lot of fun
1463002 hes a lot of fun to be around but he wants to do well on the football field and thats the most important thing
1463003 yeah i can play fast im not as hesitant when i get off the ball now
1463004 now i know where im going so im there full speed that makes more of a difference than thinking because when youre thinking you play a little slower
1463005 he is real quick off the ball he is strong he is doing things better than he was last year he has learned to use his hands better he may be the strongest guy we have so we have gotten him to utilize that
1463006 i was sitting in a jail cell not understanding if id ever play again
1463007 now that im here and i have this opportunity im really embracing it
1463008 we are committed to trying to get colt and john on the field at the same time
1463009 i told john when he reported sunday were going to see if youre in shape or not
1463010 hes getting a bunch of reps at several different places
1463011 i think having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1463012 it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going towards the growth of the game of golf
1463013 the majors are incredibly big as we know but we still capture the same audience that are already interested in the game
1463014 the olympics brings us to new markets on a worldwide scale and i cant imagine how big the game can become in countries like china and india that has so many more people than the united states does
1463015 the first opportunity for it to be an olympic sport would be 2016
1463016 our tv contracts and sponsor contracts typically end in 2012
1463017 there would be plenty of time to factor that into the equation its only once every four years its not a big disruption by any means
1463018 i dont think that golf should be an olympic sport at all
1463019 i dont think basketball should be an olympic sport i dont think tennis should be an olympic sport
1463020 if i was running the olympics i would go back to the way it was originally gymnastics weight lifting swimming track and field marathons
1463021 they are trying to get the value they think is reasonably in its various parts
1463022 it will be next to impossible to assess the franchise values unless you know what the contracts are that they work under
1463023 theres a very special media market in new york for sports teams
1463024 there is significant value over and above the average franchise because of the market
1463025 we believe that cablevisions options will be limited by the credit markets
1463026 it is ridiculous you can reach a european final and then get knocked out in the first game of the next season but thats the way it has happened
1463027 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1463028 i need to try and find a bit more consistency for me to really feel like i can compete when the gun goes off
1463029 my game is kind of coming and going right now
1463030 ive been working on trying to get it a bit more consistent but last week was like a typical week for me at this point two really good rounds i thought i had something going and then kind of a so so round on sunday
1463031 i felt like i was gaining on something but then came out on sunday and sort of fell away a little bit again
1463032 thats been disappointing i would love to get to a point where the feelings dont come and go so much
1463033 being a left handed person playing right handed i have some tendencies that tend to work against me in my golf swing when im not playing well
1463034 at that point i start fighting those tendencies its just something that i have to deal with and its about inconsistency i dont think im going to try and read anything into it
1463035 im just going to go work harder at it and try and find something that sticks well see how it goes hopefully it comes together come thursday
1463036 the in stadium experience is critically important to the nfl our clubs and our fans and will be a major focus this season
1463037 we are committed to improving the fan experience in every way we can from the time fans arrive in the parking lot to when they depart the stadium
1463038 we undertook a world class research effort to discover why that might have happened
1463039 they cant keep making golf courses longer because not every course has a 20 million budget
1463040 and they cant keep us from hitting the ball far because theres enough engineers and r amp d and technology that keeps us getting longer if you can limit the amount of spin on the ball and make the guy play from the fairway its probably a good avenue
1463041 i have no problem with that because i feel like its a challenging thing for a player to judge shots out of the first cut of rough or out of the rough
1463042 is the ball going to spin how is it going to come out
1463043 as we change the grooves were going to have to start maybe looking at the way our golf ball is performing
1463044 however i already know it moves the rule book backward
1463045 how does this help the average golfer enjoy the game more
1463046 we think were in good legal position in case a manufacturer does feel necessary to file a lawsuit
1463047 lia concep di nuovo e partor un figlio disse perch il signore ha sentito che ero disprezzata mi ha concesso anche questo e lo chiam simone
1463048 senza pensieri la mia vita sar chi vorr vivr in libert
1463049 a volte la gente pu svanire proprio davanti ai nostri occhi
1463050 quando si spezza il cuore non fa rumore ti ritrovi a urlare dentro e nessuno ti sente
1463051 im not going to bring a guy in that throws 85 miles an hour to hit somebody i guarantee it ill bring octavio dotel ill bring matt thornton then i will tell them to throw at them thats the way i do business
1463052 i dont think that golf should be an olympic sport at all
1463053 i dont think basketball should be an olympic sport i dont think tennis should be an olympic sport i think if i was running the olympics now this is just simply if i was the guy running it i would go back to the way it was originally gymnastics weightlifting swimming track and field marathons thats to me what the olympics is
1463054 the olympics is not about tennis or golf or anything like that in my opinion those are like in basketball
1463055 youve got three sports there that are like guys are getting paid a lot of money to play and compete week in and week out playing those sports and its just so professional and to me thats not what the olympics is about
1463056 to me the olympics was founded on amateur sports guys go in there and train for four years and putting their whole lives on the line to win a gold medal
1463057 having golf as an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1463058 it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundations and all those revenues and that would all be going towards the growth of the game of golf
1463059 every country wants to be represented properly in the olympics
1463060 the olympics brings us to new markets on a worldwide scale and i cant imagine how big the game would become in countries like china and india that has so many more people that the united states does if it became a priority for those countries to partake successfully in the olympics and put the revenue in towards growing the game there just about everybody would win
1463061 i havent really looked into the thought of playing in the olympic games to be honest
1463062 its never been its never been in the olympics so i really havent paid any attention to it at all at the minute
1463063 ive narrowed my list down to delaware syracuse ecu and ohio
1463064 i met with my coaches and parents i felt like those were the top four that were interested in me
1463065 my coach is going to talk to me more soon about whether i should commit or wait for senior offers im not really leaning one way or another
1463066 i want to take here to syracuse and delaware in the near future before the season starts then if i take official visits ill go to ecu and ohio
1463067 the reason i may not decide now is that last year i was a blocking tight end my role will change this season and im the no 1 passing target i could attract more offers i do know that i dont want to decommit
1463068 the top thing in my book is academics syracuse is the no 1 communications school in the country while delaware offers communication and sports management i want to try to become a sports agent

1463079 the problem is that dalton mcguinty already has his hands over his ears
1463080 he has no intention of giving working families in ontario or seniors a break
1463081 if the government was interested in changing things they could change things
1463082 theyre very clear theyve made a decision theyre going to continue with that decision and theyre going through the motions with these hearings
1463083 whatever the details there have been clearly unintended consequences to local property taxpayers
1463084 we are asking you this morning that you recommend a legislated remedy that the province adopt legislation to clearly state that the ontario health premium is an employee responsibility and not the responsibility of employers
1463085 there is no doubt that this tax would have been eliminated had it been named differently perhaps the bureaucrat salary enhancement tax
1463086 dalton mcguinty has already explicitly stated that regardless of the outcome of this review the tax will not be eliminated

1463093 david has done what he set out to do to show very clearly that he is prepared to take on the leadership
1463094 it is not for him to bring down a prime minister and he does not know what will happen to gordon next that is for others to decide
1463095 but he wanted to make it very clear so that there could be no misunderstanding at all that he is up for this
1463096 if it comes to a contest putting alan milburn forward as a proposed chancellor would show everyone just how serious about rescuing the labour party david is
1463097 the party is crying out for someone to be positive about the governments prospects someone who is prepared to say yes things arent looking great but we cant give up weve got to go out and take the fight to the tories
1463098 i wouldnt predict gordons demise too quickly i think he is just in a period where circumstances have got the british people appropriately concerned about how to get from day to day week to week
1463099 the only advice i would give him is that he has got a big brain and a good heart he just needs to apply them both to working through these issues as best he can and trust the politics

1463104 some frankly will take umbrage with that and im looking them in the eye and saying im moving forward im going to grow this police department
1463105 but more importantly is what we do with those cops what the hell difference does it make if i got 1 000 more cops if theyre not getting crime down so the public in this city every dime theyre spending on that trash fee is ultimately resulting in fewer victims of crime in this city lets get that straight

1463115 prior studies have looked at atrial fibrillation in young and middle aged and generally healthy people
1463116 they found that for example marathon runners have a higher risk of atrial fibrillation but the vast majority of atrial fibrillation occurs later in life after 65 about one in five people develops over 10 years
1463117 no one has looked at exercise and atrial fibrillation in these older people
1463118 we found that light to moderate exercise such as walking 10 blocks a week was associated with a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation
1463119 we have enrolled patients who have atrial fibrillation already to see whether exercise improves their quality of life
1463120 preliminary data appears to be that they feel better and function better
1463121 there are additional strong reasons for the public to focus on exercise
1463122 the size of organisms tends to be constrained by a scaling principle scientists call surface to volume ratio
1463123 as the organism grows this surface to volume ratio declines in a way this is how nature keeps the sizes of various species in check
1463124 the average size of the prey captured by the colony increased 20 fold as colony size increased from less than 100 to 10 000 spiders
1463125 so even though the number of prey falls sharply as the colony grows the biomass that individual spiders acquire actually increases
1463126 there simply arent enough large insects in those areas to sustain this type of foraging behaviour
1463127 the idea was to create an incident in which saddam lashes out

1463129 a quantum improvement in electromechanical coupling and strain levels compared to pzt ceramics purewave crystals are purer more uniform have lower losses and are able to transfer energy with greater precision and efficiency
1463130 marriage involves the acknowledgment of the right of life that is to come into being a right which is not subject to the disposal of the married couple unless this right is acknowledged as a matter of principle marriage ceases to be marriage and becomes a mere liaison to raise the question whether we are here concerned with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
1463131 marriage as the marriage tablets themselves proclaim joins male and female for the procreation of children whoever says that to procreate children is a worse sin than to copulate thereby prohibits marriage and he makes the woman no more a wife but a harlot who when she has been given certain gifts is joined to man to satisfy his lust if there is a wife there is matrimony but there is no matrimony where motherhood is prevented for then there is no wife

1463137 how effective is new zealands education system based on the performance of 15 year old students in the oecds 2006 programme for international student assessment pisa test where students are ranked near the top out of 30 countries some argue that there is cause for celebration unfortunately on a closer examination any cause for congratulations is somewhat premature the first thing to be said about pisa is that there is increasing evidence that the oecds sponsored test is flawed especially when compared to the trends in international mathematics and science study timss tests involving a series of mathematics and science tests since the mid 90s involving years 4 8 and 12
1463138 victory in the cold war was some hallmark movie lesson in global hand holding
1463139 there is legitimate concern about school laws and regulations that are unworkable unnecessary or otherwise in need of revision or repeal an interesting inconsistency in this regard is how the states treat the k 12 public schools for which they are constitutionally responsible but where much of the management is delegated to local school boards compared to their oversight of state colleges and universities which they own outright
1463140 1 at late stages of pregnancy there is very little biological or moral difference between slaying an unborn fetus and slaying a delivered baby yet the latter is rightly considered murder while the former isnt even illegal
1463141 2 every other country in the world has some sort of abortion law unlike canada we tend to regard european nations as the height of social liberalism yet their laws are actually quite strict when it comes to gestation limits on abortion france for instance permits abortion on demand only until the 10th week of pregnancy is this really a case where were right and the whole rest of the world is wrong
1463142 yes dumbass this really is a case where were right and the rest of the world is wrong
1463143 3 creating a law to regulate abortion does not hinge as some high school debating types presuppose on the existence of fetal rights even if one supposes that a fetus has no rights whatsoever a radical but admittedly widespread position in post religious western nations that does not mean society has no right to protect a fetus after all we protect all sorts of things that have no rights including trees wetlands endangered insect species and heritage buildings if we extend protection to those things in certain cases notwithstanding the offsetting rights of affected property owners why would we not protect an unborn child in certain cases notwithstanding the offsetting rights of a mother
1463144 8 and if it is fine to abort a fetus because of its sex why not because it suffers from a genetic abnormality even a mild one or because it is has some gene linked to well take your pick of socially and medically undesirable traits a free for all abortion policy is a necessary and in some cases sufficient condition for parentally administered eugenics

1463155 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1463156 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1463157 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1463158 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1463159 they seem more concerned about growth for the rest of this year and id say right now they appear to be dovish for the short term
1463160 lets see what the cost of this is going you taptap this will cost you and taptaptap add on this and it will be taptaptap and oh not to forget this will cost taptaptap then it gets irritation just certian circumstances i find that tapping annoying otherwise i ignore it

1463162 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1463163 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1463164 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1463165 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1463166 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1463167 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1463168 you have to hope the senate doesnt take it up
1463169 at least we as people who are accountable to our constituents can go back home and talk about what we did on the issue

1463171 if verified the discovery of these new populations of gorilla are hugely significant for our work as conservationists but we must not be distracted from the very real and present danger these gorillas are in from man and ebola
1463172 there is a danger that we concentrate on the more famous species
1463173 what about the other species that weve identified as in danger there are so many that are on the brink of extinction
1463174 in malaysia sumatra and borneo the big problem is destruction of forests to make way for palm oil and biofuels ironically with biofuels something that is nominally associated with helping the environment can have harmful unintentional consequences
1463175 in 1980 the population density of macaques was as much as 300 individuals per square kilometer in 10 years this had decreased to between 60 to 20 individuals per square kilometer
1463176 imagine the human population of the world reduced to that of one small town thats what we are talking about here
1463177 the habitats in which they live are largely impenetrable and we constantly find new species
1463178 having said that this the western lowland gorillas remains a unique find i dont know if well ever find something on this scale again
1463179 i think the lesson for conservationists today is that yes the world is full of surprises theres a lot of uncharted territory there in central africa there may be other populations
1463180 were talking about the congo basin rainforest here it is vast it is huge its second only to the amazon and its impenetrable
1463181 by participating in the scheduled departure program those who have had their day in court and have been ordered to leave the country have an opportunity to comply with the law and gain control of how their families are affected by their removal

1463184 the allegations made in the times article are simply not true there was no deal never mind a deal preventing the uk military from entering basra
1463185 i have the greatest confidence in the judgement of uk military commanders in iraq and i would never seek to constrain their ability to make decisions
1463186 britain would release around 60 militia prisoners and stop patrolling inside the city in return the mehdi army agreed not to attack the british as they withdrew to the airport
1463187 lives were saved but basra was effectively abandoned now questions are being asked about just how far this deal tied british commanders hands during this years battle for basra
1463188 no secret deal or accommodation with the militias kept us out of the city
1463189 the only limit placed on the profile of our support was mr malikis rightful concern that the iraqi security forces be seen by the people of basrah to be those enforcing the rule of law in the city
1463190 had no bearing on the decision to go to the city
1463191 exactly under what circumstances the negotiations took place and whether or not they tied the hands of the british army
1463192 what would be unacceptable is if our troops were under effective political orders not to take risks because potential loss of life would be politically unacceptable
1463193 when the iraqi army needed help our forces should have been free to give that help as required
1463194 given the guaranteed quality of service content protection and bandwidth of 1394 and now the ability to deliver these benefits over existing coax throughout the home we consider this new standard to be a significant development in support of next generation home networking

1463196 people have a hard time adhering to diets and our research shows that choosing eggs for breakfast can dramatically improve the success of a weight loss plan
1463197 apparently the increased satiety and energy due to eggs helps people better comply with a reduced calorie diet
1463198 eggs are a good source of all natural high quality protein so they can help keep you satisfied longer making it easier to resist tempting snacks

1463243 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1463244 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1463245 we disagree with that we believe that the larger order of concern is deflation which is emanating from this widespread deleveraging thats taking place in every sector of the credit markets in our view the fed is late to the game they continue to fight and focus on trying to influence people but all of their rate cuts have not been evidenced in any other sectors of the credit market except treasuries where rates have gone up

1463259 nowadays theres more and more to do in the catholic church as a young person i feel empowered
1463260 the catholic church needs to be set on fire and young people have a natural fire about them theyre young theyre excited about life and motivated theyre not skeptical or worn down by bad experiences or pessimism the more young people we get involved the more optimistic and energized the catholic church will be
1463261 i was taught by the sisters at the catholic school i went to and so i was very familiar with them but i assumed they were boring or all they do is pray and i thought that was horrible

1463295 they tried to charge me for car seats which are safety items and i argued and they checked regulations and decided they wont charge us for the car seats
1463296 unification for the sake of unification is not the path we decided to go down
1463297 in the end what matters most is what consumers are looking for but having too many people on the design phase especially early on would have hurt the project you could have three different user interfaces and a couple of application layers that doesnt make sense
1463298 a lot has happened in the last 12 months to push us in this direction
1463299 from our perspective creating a platform in a mobile space is not like building for the pc with mobile you are fighting for every spare 500 kilobytes you can find we know because we are building handsets right now so instead of adding in compatibility for everything we think it is important to clarify for developers the best possible direction and make it open source so it is available to more people

1463301 we also work with microsoft and symbian and our interaction with other groups is helping with standardization in the industry
1463302 in the end germanys recognition of croatias independence without any guarantees of the serb minoritys national rights in croatia made the outbreak of war and the disintegration of yugoslavia inevitable the same holds true for bosnia germany and the u s recognized bosnian independence even though the majority of bosnian serbs and croats about 51 percent of the republic had rejected it by doing so they put their seal of approval on bosnias descent into war
1463303 although there had been crimes committed either on the orders or with the tacit approval of the croatian leadership in the presence and with the participation of the military
1463304 it expressly warned the croatian authorities and president tu man of their obligation to protect the serb civilians and prisoners of war the atrocities like those committed in the in 1993 were not to be repeated
1463305 thus confirming that the situation in the field was exactly what the u s administration wanted to prevent
1463306 food allergic individuals need to increase the awareness of their food allergy among the people around them
1463307 this would include not only telling them that they are food allergic but also showing them how to treat them and how to recognize signs of an ongoing reaction
1463308 there are serious issues that need to be addressed in terms of educating these young adults that it is of utmost importance to not only maintain emergency medication but to have it with you at all times
1463309 until all students who display symptoms of a severe reaction are receiving epinephrine i would say that theres a significant gap that needs to be closed
1463310 but we realised there were no stars in it so that it must be a cloud of gas
1463311 we now think that what were looking at is light from a quasar the bright stormy centre of a distant galaxy powered by a supermassive black hole
1463312 the quasar itself is no longer visible to us but its light continues to travel through space and the voorwerp is a massive light echo produced as this light strikes the gas
1463313 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1463314 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise
1463315 trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1463316 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have done before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1463317 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1463318 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1463319 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1463320 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1463321 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
1463322 when we got the news about hannys voorwerp we were intrigued to find out what it was and fortunately we were able to slew the telescopes round and get some great images and spectra to study it
1463323 it was only later that we heard the story about how it had been discovered its inspirational that hanny picked out this object from galaxy zoo in her spare time and nobody had ever seen anything like it before
1463324 laura estoy en la puerta primera de la gran superficie deja lo que est s haciendo y ven corriendo es muy muy importante noo no hay enfermos ni accidentados tranquila pero hazme caso de verdad que es importante
1463325 presently there is simply no scientific basis for claims that the escalating cost of disasters is the result of anything other than increasing societal vulnerability
1463326 i think if and when we do wed probably announce it after the fact as opposed to making any big announcement
1463327 we both wear rings and im giddy when i see all the pictures of people so happy standing there confirming the love they wish they could have expressed for a long time
1463328 im a big proponent of monogamous relationships regardless of sexuality and im proud of how the nation is steering toward that
1463329 doesnt it hurt just a little to know that google is the leader in the silverlight advertising space before your company has even scratched the surface
1463330 surely it would make some sense to take control of the silverlight advertising space in a big way wouldnt it once again google has pulled the wool over microsofts eyes and the company is in the dark circling around wondering how in the world itll be able to beat google on something anything
1463331 if this isnt the catalyst microsoft needs i dont know what is
1463332 not only being boxed out of the advertising space all over the web but now its being boxed out of advertising on its own platform without even harnessing its power to fight back
1463333 microsofts very own platform is already being hijacked by its biggest competitor and it better move fast if it doesnt want to be pushed out of that advertising space too
1463334 why microsoft is not utilizing silverlight 2 to serve video ads coming from its advertising inventory
1463335 theres no mind control or anything that looks good on a hollywood screen
1463336 really people make it out to be much more sinister than it is
1463337 its the ability to get what you want by attraction rather than deception
1463338 if you mislead people or use propaganda and lose your credibility you lose your ability to attract
1463339 theyre honest young soldiers trying to do the right thing
1463340 the fact that they are genuine and understand they are in someone elses home makes them invaluable were trying to get people not to pull that trigger
1463341 there was basically a little more as i delved deeper into it than i was aware of at the time
1463342 i kind of like to think that were in the business of taking young men and building them into responsible young men and obviously i feel like i failed in this situation
1463343 sometimes for the better good of the whole some parts have to be sacrificed because somewhere along the line everybody has to realize theres consequences for their actions you just dont get open checkbooks to write checks on a balance that isnt there
1463344 mike has done pretty much everything weve asked him on and off the field
1463345 it would foolish for me based on what i saw in the spring and on what we have at quarterback to say that mike hartline isnt the preemptive starter
1463346 we dont completely fall off the face of the earth
1463347 we have three guys that were going to be part of it that right now arent going to be but i feel like we have enough quality athletes and talent that its a completely realistic goal
1463348 they laid out some specific things that curtis needed to do but everybody felt like he could eventually move forward and still have a chance to be the starting quarterback
1463349 curtis realizes that hes let his teammates fans and coaches down
1463350 now all those people arent going to be there for him
1463351 he told me that out of all those guys he used to hang with not one of them have checked in with him to see how hes doing thats just one of those life lessons he will just have to get past this move on and try to become a better man and person because of it
1463352 but expectations were so high for him and he probably got caught up in some of the hype and some people in lexington might have treated him better than he needed to be treated
1463353 when i recruited curtis i had all these expectations of him being a great player
1463354 and he is a great player we just never saw it at kentucky
1463355 this is not the kind of modeling that i did and i would like it if you made that perfectly clear
1463356 igor golovanov un clandestino alla corte della regina elisabetta ii
1463357 weve had enough of inspections and all sorts of raids at the instigation of commercial entities in general both our law enforcement agencies and state institutions should stop terrifying businesses
1463358 i think medvedev is trying to weaken the people who dont suit him in putins circle
1463359 there is a disagreement about how relations should be with business and how to conduct foreign policy this division exists and the question now is whether it can be managed or whether it will grow
1463360 this is the first time that the president has strongly and clearly opposed putins line
1463361 what medvedev said is correct from the perspective of economics on the other hand the business elite doesnt really believe that he is the full fledged president but this is a first step that shows that he is becoming president and that is good
1463362 in the eyes of the public putin is being active strict masculine tough and decisive most voters like this after all who likes the rich they like to see another fat cat put in his place
1463363 the fact that this harms the stock markets causes the oil companies to lose money and harms investment projects in our country doesnt occur to them
1463364 putin is openly and publicly declaring that he is the main figure on the political map and its clear that medvedev still lacks either the resources courage or political experience to answer him forcefully
1463365 putin is now attacking but medvedev is not simply stepping quietly aside he feels the obligation to resist but softly he is not doing this directly but more like acting like a servant in a play by moliere or shakespeare who is whispering an aside while his master is speaking
1463366 i think in the short term they will manage and regulate this disagreement and move it to the back burner but i think in the long term this disagreement can only grow
1463367 sometimes my mom tells me i was voted number one whatever in israel
1463368 today the joint commission collects 113 million in annual revenue mainly from the fees it charges hospitals for telling them whether they comply with federal regulations
1463369 deeming authority means that if joint commission gives its seal of approval to a hospital cms is satisfied that the hospital is following federal regulations in other words hospitals enrolling in the accreditation program only have to please one master and that master is really nice accrediting 99 of all hospitals it surveys
1463370 the external review of hospital quality a call for greater accountability
1463371 unlikely to detect substandard patterns of care or individual practitioners with questionable skills
1463372 given the serious limitations in joint commissions accreditation program and that efforts to improve this program through informal action by the centers for medicare and medicaid cms have not led to necessary improvements congress should consider giving cms the same kind of authority over joint commissions hospital accreditation program that it has over all other medicare accreditation programs
1463373 clean bills of health are awarded despite deaths infection outbreaks
1463374 in early 1997 hospital borne germs were infecting dozens of patients up to one in five contracted antibiotic resistant germs after open heart surgery dust and flies littered the operating room during surgeries according to internal hospital records obtained by the
1463375 the joint commission learned of a potential infection outbreak after receiving complaints filed by a patient but the organization decided not to visit the hospital or conduct interviews with patients or doctors hospital and court records show
1463376 instead the joint commission reviewed patient files selected and mailed by hospital officials
1463377 a joint commission regional supervisor telephoned the bridgeport hospital on feb 25 1997 according to a hospital memo based on the review he stated that while they appreciated the information which they have received no follow up was deemed by the joint commission to be necessary at this time according to the memo
1463378 but during the same month that joint commission officials closed their inquiry state public health investigators conducted a surprise inspection and found myriad patient care and infection control violations such as failure by surgical assistants to wash hands
1463379 the hospital initiated dozens of reforms after the state inspection and currently is in compliance with all standards according to state public health agencies infection rates have been reduced to less than 1 percent from a high of 20 percent
1463380 radical reconstructive surgery including complete or partial removal of the patients sternum
1463381 joint commission officials said they sent investigators to tour the hospital in august and october 2002 but their findings were withheld from the public if we want any modicum of cooperation from the hospitals they have to feel were not going to put it investigative findings right out on the street the head of the joint commission said
1463382 inspectors from the federal centers for medicare amp medicaid services staged a surprise inspection at palm beach gardens and declared that uncorrected infection control deficiencies represented immediate jeopardy to patients
1463383 joint commission officials said surveys represent a snapshot of quality not guarantees of patient safety
1463384 the house version of the bill called for revoking the commissions authority the senates version did not when the house and senate hammered out a final version the joint commission wasnt mentioned anywhere
1463385 this joint commission legislative houdini act is a curious thing
1463386 it seems that anything that might alter the fate of the nations most influential health group would really raise a raucous

1463388 there is no such thing as a good influence mr gray all influence is immoral immoral from the scientific point of view

1463579 you know whats wrong with scientific power its a form of inherited wealth and you know what assholes congenitally rich people are it never fails most kinds of power require a substantial sacrifice by whoever wants that power there is an apprenticeship a discipline lasting many years whatever kind of power you want president of the company black belt in karate spiritual guru whatever it is you seek you have to put in the time the practice the effort you must give up a lot to get it it has to be very important to you and once youve attained it it is your power it cant be given away it resides in you it is literally the result of your discipline
1463580 now what is interesting about this process is by the time someone has acquired the ability to kill with his bare hands he has also matured to the point where he wont use it unwisely so that kind of power has a built in control the discipline of getting the power changes you so that you wont abuse it
1463581 but scientific power is like inherited wealth attained without discipline you read what others have done and you take the next step you can do it very young you can make progress very fast there is no discipline lasting many decades there is no mastery old scientists are ignored there is no humility before nature there is only a get rich quick make a name for yourself fast philosophy cheat lie falsify it doesnt matter not to you or to your colleagues no one will criticize you no one has any standards they are all trying to do the same thing to do something big and do it fast
1463582 and because you can stand on the shoulders of giants you can accomplish something quickly you dont even know exactly what you have done but already you have reported it patented it and sold it and the buyer will have even less discipline than you the buyer simply purchases the power like any commodity the buyer doesnt even conceive that any discipline might be necessary

1463680 feature animation has so frequently been mistaken as a childrens medium that the issue has become a sore point for many of the fields leading creators
1463681 was such an absurd storyline it didnt impress many funders and was only made thanks to a private investor
1463682 an internationally acclaimed artist whose achievements until now have been accomplished in areas other than cinema but whose leap into the world of film has been an auspicious one
1463683 weve gotten to the age where we dont feel like fighting anymore because the end is a lot closer than the beginning

1463689 we want to allow the visitor as he sits in the pew to become part of a worship service from an old assembly of god church back in the 1930s and 40s

1463691 closed to the public for more than a half century the building was restored this year by the elvis presley memorial foundation on aug 9 after a brief ceremony and prayer the historic pentecostal church will again open its doors to the world
1463692 the congregation had a lifelong impact on young elvis in many ways i think his musical tastes and his understanding of religion and worship those things had already been formed at the assembly of god church in tupelo before he set off for memphis and worldwide fame
1463693 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
1463694 i have this unbelievably strong feeling that him sitting beside stacy had something to do with this
1463695 even if he was doing drugs it wouldnt make him do something like that theres no excuse
1463696 she said to me i dont know where he is he had to leave town it was an emergency
1463697 everyone is talking about his background how he went to church was a good guy he never gave tim a chance

1463700 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act

1463705 the reported incident which if true is a miracle nearly unheard of in modern times occurred during hickeys citywide leaders conference in may attended by nearly 10 000 pastors and local leaders from curious muslims to orthodox coptic christians
1463706 the boxes were given out leaving none in the room
1463707 after the food was completely distributed and after the crowd swelled to about 5 000 hickey said volunteers were astonished to return to what shouldve been a room of empty tables to discover 1 200 more lunches she said after they handed out the mysterious extras another 1 200 appeared leaving a surplus of food and dumbfounded witnesses
1463708 i am fully convinced that this was a supernatural occurrence
1463709 it is something i have believed to see in my ministry and am overjoyed that it happened it happened in such a way that my ministry was not at all associated with it which left local volunteers and non christians marveling at what had happened

1463740 but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardize future treatment for mothers and infants
1463741 it reinforces the need to treat these women with combination therapy thereby providing better prevention for the infant while providing better treatment for the mother
1463742 public health efforts should continue to expand combination therapy so that mothers and babies arent left vulnerable to drug resistance
1463743 these states are ones you learn about in introductory quantum mechanics classes but no one has been able to controllably create them before
1463744 in quantum mechanics the energy or amplitude of motion of this pendulum only comes in finite steps in quanta we first carefully prepared the resonator in these quantum states and showed we could do this controllably and then measure the states then we kicked the pendulum directly a method where the amplitude can take on any value and appears to not be limited to these quanta but when we look at the resonator with our qubit we see that the amplitude does come in steps but that the resonator is actually in several such states at the same time so that on average it looks like it is not limited to the quantum states
1463745 this resonator once you excite it has to swing for a very long time
1463746 the first samples i fabricated stopped oscillating very quickly we had to work to rearrange the fabrication method to get the resonator to oscillate longer
1463747 harmonic oscillators might allow us to get a quantum computer built more quickly
1463748 i think if they really build one of these quantum computers there will definitely be resonators in them
1463749 repeated commit or defer decisions with a deadline the influenza vaccine composition
1463750 first that the fda should be willing to consider deferring a decision about which strains to include if early conclusive evidence isnt available
1463751 second the fda should reexamine its commitment to the rigid structure of the vaccine with exactly one strain from each of three categories for example if theres agreement on choosing two of the strains and disagreement about which strain to pick for the third why not include four

1463753 operational security is an important aspect of how our customers operate
1463754 when fema was first made aware of a potential compromise of the process fema suspended the procurement to allow for appropriate review
1463755 the review is being completed and is both procurement and personnel sensitive in nature
1463756 they reflect the distasteful consequences that can occur even in a properly oriented procurement system when persons in positions of authority violate their responsibilities
1463757 we dont believe the security or privacy of these would be members will be compromised in any way

1463829 he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this and cheney proceeded to meet with renewable energy groups once and met with the oil companies 40 times
1463830 john mccain has taken a page out of the bush cheney playbook hes offering a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy
1463831 while sen mccains plan wont save you at the pump any time soon i have to say this it sure has raised him a lot of campaign dollars
1463832 sen mccain raised more than 1 million from the oil industry just last month just last month most of which came after he announced his plan for offshore drilling to a roomful of oil executives
1463833 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1463834 solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
1463835 that will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tidal and bio fuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like offshore drilling clean coal and nuclear power like the power produced at this plant here in michigan
1463836 it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation

1463985 but that list is always changing and as drought conditions change there might be other counties submitted and approved so producers who think they might be eligible need to check with their local fsa office to determine if their county has been approved for emergency haying and grazing of crp land
1463986 they can make the decision whether that is something they want to pursue or not for their farming operation
1463987 if they do then they need to get their conservation plan modified to lay out the terms of that haying or grazing and once that is approved by their county office then they can proceed with the activity

1464007 since our last submission new information from usda u s department of agriculture and other sources has become available that raises additional concerns regarding the jbs mergers
1464008 the basis for all cattle procurement transactions ultimately is tied to the cash market and r calf has demonstrated that even under existing levels of concentration meatpackers procure large volumes of un priced cattle and other non cash cattle enabling them to shun the cash market for extended periods of time
1464009 when packers shun the cash market competition in the cash market is reduced and all cattle procurement transactions are thereafter tied to the price generated from the competition deficient cash market leading to lower prices paid for all cattle sold to all meatpackers
1464010 this trend demonstrates the ever increasing acquisition of market power and is evident in recent usda reports that show a precipitous drop in the volume of cash cattle procurements since 2005 a drop of 15
1464011 jbs acquisition of five rivers feedlots would by its very structure exacerbate the ongoing erosion of the price making cash market given that the acquisition would place brazilian owned jbs in direct ownership of and in close proximity to the five rivers feedlots currently owned by smithfield
1464012 this significant price difference between regions demonstrates that the u s fed cattle market unlike the wholesale beef market consists of several regional markets and should not be viewed as a national market
1464013 higher demand for beef should translate into higher prices for the feed cattle from which the beef was derived but just the opposite has occurred because according to usda u s cattle feeders operated at a net loss when marketing their cattle in each of the 10 months of august 2007 through may 2008
1464014 this ongoing market distortion is accomplished through the exercise of market power national beef and other packers are able to purchase cattle for less in the face of increased beef demand because they can control the price paid for live cattle
1464015 it is position that this ongoing market distortion would be expected to worsen if the jbs mergers are consummated
1464016 r calf usa has built its reputation by successfully fighting battles others said couldnt be won
1464017 this too is a winnable fight despite the fact that conventional packer oriented organizations and the current administration are not expected to help this is a battle that must be fought and won otherwise the u s cattle industry will go the way of the u s hog industry where independent producers are the exception not the rule we have furnished various state attorneys general state specific information that demonstrates the harm that would occur if the jbs mergers are approved and we are asking those attorneys general to formally challenge this merger

1464036 what we are looking at is how we can do a combination of more effective agency self assessment and then planned targeting for a specific issue and what will invoke an inspection

1464044 no one believes the proposals to introduce directly elected crime and policing representatives will strengthen police authorities or provide greater accountability over the funding of the police the green paper fails to make any proposals to increase police authorities ability to scrutinise budgets control expenditure or deliver improved efficiency within police forces in the place of substantive reforms needed to police authorities powers and responsibilities we have tinkering with their membership directly elected crime and policing representatives will not strengthen the link between those responsible for delivering policing and the public competing mandates between directly elected crime and policing representatives and the manifesto commitments of the local authorities their force covers will undoubtedly lead to blame shifting and buck passing between the police authority and its local authorities and push them in different directions

1464057 spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1464058 in the light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high
1464059 you can make the argument that the inflation risks are a little less than in june and the growth outlook a little worse

1464093 the battle for wine and love or how i saved the world from parkerization
1464094 increasingly i find i have a very particular peculiar palate and point of view i often dont taste or see the world in the same way others do
1464095 i have a distinct preference for the traditional wines of western europe and a matching skepticism about most of the wines produced in the new world as well as for those wines made in the old world that seek to imitate the characteristics of their new world brethren
1464096 but begin to deflate as soon as they are opened like blow up dolls
1464097 you couldnt very well serve the most classic dishes from italy with these new wines
1464098 as the journalists were slapping high scores on the new wines i retreated to my older collection every time i drank an old barolo i was overwhelmed with remorse there was the italian in me why change such a perfect thing what could i do to make sure these guys who followed the old way these holdouts didnt disappear altogether
1464099 there were bad wines and great wines not right wines and wrong wines what you liked was in large part a question of taste a complex concept generally agreed upon to be a reflection of personal preference and part of tasting and understanding wine involved being open to the idea that some wine requires patience and work and is not instantly gratifying

1464218 foundation forces which earn independence from central government by meeting central government targets miss the whole point of local policing
1464219 as to forces having foundation status i do not understand what acpo mean as chief officers already have autonomy over how they allocate budgets and deploy resources targets could be abolished overnight we dont need a new initiative with a new name to return to traditional policing methods and allow officers to use their judgment and experience to tackle crime perhaps this is part of acpos hidden agenda to remove national standards for training and equipment a move that will be extremely detrimental to policing and one we will fiercely oppose

1464442 while search marketers are diversifying their digital content portfolios with videos press releases and images to remain competitive in the blended search landscape
1464443 their lack of alignment with user behavior suggests that they are missing the mark again this speaks to the big disconnect between search marketer strategy and search engine user behavior to fully capitalize on their efforts search marketers need to take user behavior into consideration at all times

1464573 june and july are the best time of the year for tomatoes but our movement has completely stopped in the united states
1464574 this is normally a huge week for the industry because everyone barbecues but were just not seeing that demand materialize
1464575 we are slowly starting to see consumers recognize that california tomatoes are in fact safe but for a grower to walk away from a 225 000 investment theres a lot of pain
1464576 the collateral damage inflicted on thousands of innocent producers in this country by fda blanket advisories such as with spinach and tomatoes cannot go unchallenged
1464577 congress must investigate this matter and determine ways to avoid this in the future and make the innocent tomato growers packers and shippers whole

1464605 the president can begin by announcing that offshore oil leasing will commence on october 1 2008 the day after the current congressional ban expires a showdown on this issue also will be a political winner for republicans this is precisely what democrats are scrambling to avoid the president should make it clear that he wont sign any such extension this would put the ball in the democrats court forcing them to decide whether stopping offshore drilling is worth shutting down the government if they decide it is just weeks before election day the dynamics of the election will transform dramatically energy will no longer be one of several top tier issues it will be the only issue and it will favor republicans right when they need it most
1464606 even in one of the bluest of blue liberal states new jersey 56 of residents actually want oil rigs established off the state coast according to a newly released monmouth university gannett new jersey poll conducted in mid july that shows just how deep and widespread pro drilling sentiment now is

1464612 the residents of the minneapolis saint paul metro area have been great partners in our efforts to host a successful convention
1464613 because of efforts like this one were confident a warm welcome will be extended to the 45 000 attendees who will be arriving in just a few weeks
1464614 our local taxi cab drivers will be among the first to welcome the 45 000 visitors coming to town for the convention
1464615 we want our guests to have a great first impression of minneapolis saint paul and the surrounding area and experience a clean and friendly community
1464616 we need to make it as easy as possible for our guests to hail a cab and reach their destination safely and in a friendly timely manner
1464617 these new programs will allow cab drivers throughout the metro to work together to help us greet our guests for the convention in a courteous professional way
1464618 its up to everyone in our communities to do their part to make a lasting impression on our guests
1464619 in many cases a taxi driver is one of the first points of contact for a visitor im confident our metro drivers are going to help us make the cities shine
1464620 we all met through a support group on facebook it is tough having a relationship with someone in the military and you often need some support some of us have not even met one another yet
1464621 it is a scary thought and one we dont like to think about often but it is of great comfort to us knowing that if the unthinkable were to happen fantastic organisations such as help for heroes would be there to give our other halves the best care possible
1464622 they help our injured heroes by supporting them through various stages of medical treatments rehab physiotherapy and help to provide them with opportunities that will enable them to rebuild their lives become as independent as possible and hopefully fulfil their potential again

1464640 but many people have read articles in the new york times and other publications that dr reddy has designed a new condom
1464641 so people naturally assume that the new condom inspiral is an improvement over pleasure plus
1464642 if a condom gives the maximum pleasure even those who are reluctant to use one will love to use it
1464643 in the age of aids we must strive to offer the best quality and safest condoms
1464644 as a man who really wants to help people fight aids a person with a golden heart but not always successful at business
1464645 in terms of harm they serve the same niche market as an enhanced pleasure condom
1464646 the inspiral condom is a clear deviation from the embodiments protected by the plaintiffs patents
1464647 this was never a secret they knew that the inspiral was coming out

1464649 when an unclean spirit comes out of a man it passes through parched places in search of a resting place and finds none then it says i will go back to my house out of which i moved and on arriving it finds it unoccupied but swept clean and adorned then it goes its way and takes along with it seven different spirits more wicked than itself and after getting inside they dwell there and the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first
1464650 its a crowded market and every brand will be chasing their space to promote their product this was a way to have fun with it pizza always brings something to the party

1464669 personally i would have loved a bit more from the mexicans perspective the feel he gets of her as she slides him in how he has more than one type of oh god moment at the same time one side of the brain enjoying while the other is revolted and horrified then add the babies into the equation and its also an oh shit moment not saying that what was presented is bad just would have liked more detail to kick the disturbing factor up just a whee bit more get more of the senses into it internally and externally

1464685 over the past 20 years its phenomenal how much building costs have gone up
1464686 since habitat here in missoula began back in 1991 weve seen lot sizes go down and down and lot prices go up and up
1464687 developers and builders have always been generous with us but we just arent getting as many donations as we used to that effort isnt there like it was last year or the year before
1464688 with the exception of grants we may receive all of our income comes from missoula its missoulians giving us money and helping us build houses for other member of the community
1464689 both of these figures were clearly impacted by the slowdown in the building industry
1464690 when they sell everything out there wont be any more lots available so we are concerned about a couple years out when we dont have a partnership like this
1464691 i have heard from some of our volunteers a woman from alberton for example i cant donate money to you because i have to give all that to the gas station so i can come down and help build the house
1464692 instead of providing homes for the needier we have to go up the income bracket in missoula to find someone who can afford the cost of the home
1464693 we dont want to set someone up to fail we dont want to put someone in a position where they cant pay their mortgage so we have to go up that income bracket to make it work
1464694 you can imagine losing all those games and being so young it humbled you and changed your ego after coming out of high school
1464695 it took a little while i knew we had to go through some hard seasons first 2 9 then 5 6 and then the success last year we knew we could do it last season the offense started rolling and all the chips fell into place basically all the hard work paid off
1464696 anything i need to know hell tell me on and off the field
1464697 especially since coming out of high school i played wide receiver i really didnt know anything about cornerback
1464698 hes younger but hes always ready to listen on and off the field hes like my little brother he came out of nowhere as a freshman asking questions all the time and next thing you know hes a freshman all american

1464703 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have had seven years to deliver on their pledges that these games would further human rights
1464704 instead the beijing games have prompted a rollback in some of the most basic rights enshrined in chinas constitution and international law
1464705 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
1464706 that failure has damaged the prospects for a legacy of enhanced media freedom greater tolerance for dissent and respect for the rule of law
1464707 when you come to the olympic games in beijing you may not know that the flowers smiles harmony and prosperity are built on a base of grievances tears imprisonment torture and blood

1464767 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1464768 i think by the time we get to the end of this year or early next year the inflation numbers will look a lot less threatening and i dont think the growth environment will be significantly improved
1464769 i found this to be a poorly disguised compromise between those who believe inflation pressures are coming down and inflation hawks who fear the fed is already behind the curve
1464770 the fed should be in a holding pattern for the next five months
1464771 i think having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1464772 it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going towards the growth of the game of golf
1464773 the majors are incredibly big as we know but we still capture the same audience that are already interested in the game
1464774 the olympics brings us to new markets on a worldwide scale and i cant imagine how big the game can become in countries like china and india that has so many more people than the united states does
1464775 its a miracle really i dont think weve got our heads round it yet

1464868 congress has in fact enacted a comprehensive legislative scheme with regard to the employment of unauthorized aliens and occupies the field to the exclusion of state law
1464869 with respect to everything external we be one nation only firmly hooked together internal government is what each state should keep to itself
1464870 p ower to regulate immigration is unquestionably exclusively a federal power
1464871 power of exclusion of foreigners being an incident of sovereignty belonging to the government of the united states as a part of those sovereign powers delegated by the constitution the right to its exercise at any time when in the judgment of the government the interests of the country require it cannot be granted away or restrained on behalf of any one
1464872 the iira does not provide notice to challenged employees or tenants does not inform the employers and owners landlords of the types of identity information needed and provides for judicial review in a court system that lacks jurisdiction it violates the due process rights of employers employees tenants and owners landlords it is therefore unconstitutional
1464873 enacting an unconstitutional ordinance is in itself a violation of the defendants police powers
1464874 i do not know where in the government of the united states gets the constitutional authority to go into the states and establish police regulations
1464875 can it be believed that under the jealousies prevailing against the general government at the adoption of the constitution the states meant to surrender the authority of preserving order of enforcing moral duties and restraining vice within their own territory
1464876 the indiana statute subjects voters to multiple and inconsistent requirements to exercise the right to vote
1464877 the federal law allows flexibility in establishing voter identification indianas statute improperly attempts to trump federal law by restricting that flexibility as a result some indiana voters may be required to show multiple forms of identification in order to comply with the state laws
1464878 the qualification of electors and the manner of holding or conducting elections are as distinct from each other as light and darkness
1464879 it cannot be said with any correctness that congress can in any way alter the rights or qualifications of voters
1464880 the right of suffrage is certainly one of the fundamental articles of republican government and ought not to be left to be regulated by the federal legislature

1464884 every human being born within the jurisdiction of the united states
1464885 it cannot be said of any indian who owes allegiance partial allegiance if you please to some other government that he is subject to the jurisdiction of the united states
1464886 he could only be referring to the laws of naturalization and consent to expatriation by the immigrant in order for him to come completely within the jurisdiction of the united states and its laws i e he cannot be a subject of another nation
1464887 the emigration of the foreigner from his native land to some other land non animo revertendi that is with the intention of changing his domicile and making his permanent home in the country to which he emigrates
1464888 all persons born in this state and resident within it except the children of transient aliens and of alien public ministers and consuls
1464889 the term citizen in the united states is analogous to the term subject in the common law the change of phrase has resulted from the change in government
1464890 the citizen cannot complain because he has voluntarily submitted himself to such a form of government he owes allegiance to the two departments so to speak and within their respective spheres i e jurisdictions must pay the penalties

1464911 i feel that if you dont use your rights you lose them
1464912 can it be believed that the states meant to surrender the authority of preserving order of enforcing moral duties and restraining vice within their own territory
1464913 he ought not silently to be embarrassed with a double allegiance
1464914 man who confesses to several allegiances is not a man anyone could completely trust
1464915 all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside

1464918 are not limited to militia service nor is an individuals enjoyment of the right contingent upon his or her continued intermittent enrollment in the militia
1464919 i will now add what i do not like first the omission of a bill of rights providing clearly and without aid of sophisms for freedom of religion freedom of the press
1464920 the phrase the right of the people when read intratextually and in light of supreme court precedent leads us to conclude that the right in question is individual
1464921 a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people being the best security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed but no person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms
1464922 for a people who are free and mean to remain so a well organized and armed militia is their best security
1464923 merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation
1464924 the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns
1464925 enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people
1464926 i t is perfectly clear that the sovereign powers vested in the state governments by their respective constitutions remained unaltered and unimpaired except so far as they were granted to the government of the united states
1464927 that a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained to arms is the proper natural and safe defense of a free state that standing armies in time of peace should be avoided as dangerous to liberty and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to and governed by the civil power
1464928 but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms should be compelled to render military service in person
1464929 of the six cases discussed thus far at least two mention the second amendment both nunn and kerner naturally read it as they read their own state constitutional provisions regarding the right to bear arms
1464930 the kentucky opinion takes a different view with which we can not agree
1464931 the word arms in the connection we find it in the constitution of the united states refers to the arms of a militiaman or soldier and the word is used in its military sense the arms of the infantry soldier are the musket and bayonet of cavalry and dragoons the sabre holster pistols and carbine of the artillery the field piece siege gun and mortar with side arms the terms dirks daggers slingshots sword canes brass knuckles and bowie knives belong to no military vocabulary were a soldier on duty found with any of these things about his person he would be punished for an offense against discipline
1464932 the words bear arms in the constitution refer to their military use and not to wearing them about the person as a part of the dress
1464933 in regard to the kind of arms referred to in the amendment 2a it must be held to refer to the weapons of warfare to be used by the militia such as swords guns rifles and muskets
1464934 refers to the arms of the militia or soldier and does not authorize the carrying of weapons not adapted to use for military purposes
1464935 the attempt to read the right to bear arms as having an exclusively collective purpose collapses when confronted with state supreme court rulings and statements by the founders that the right included the right to have arms for the defense of oneself
1464936 the right of the citizen to keep and bear arms for his own protection or in aid of the civil power when thereto legally summoned is the only right guaranteed to the citizen
1464937 there is indeed a large body of cases interpreting the right to bear arms as an individual right including self defense below are just a few
1464938 the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
1464939 nothing herein contained shall justify the practice of carrying concealed weapons or prevent the legislature from enacting penal statutes against said practice
1464940 the constitutional right to bear arms is intended to guaranty to the people in support of just government such right and to afford the citizen means for defense of self and property
1464941 reading the cases from the earliest forward informs the reader that the right was intially interpreted very broadly
1464942 later state constitutional provisions sometimes included statements to the effect that carrying concealed weapons could be banned while protecting an individual right
1464943 but none of this history helps your argument ownership of larger handguns horseman s or navy pistols by ordinary people was and still is constitutionally protected by most states
1464944 the majority in heller kept to the mainstream of state court decisions
1464945 the kentucky constitution was indeed changed to allow the state to prevent persons from carrying arms but the re wording tells us that the state still interpreted the rigth to bear arms as applying to citizens generally not merely only those actively serving in the militia kentucky did not place any limitations on who may bear arms it only allowed the state to prevent concealed carry
1464946 that any person who shall carry any pistol dirk knife slung shot or deadly weapon within the city limits of harrisburg except police officers shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor
1464947 the early decision to the contrary of bliss v commonwealth 2 litt 90 has not been generally approved
1464948 that the provisions of the act in question do not import an entire destruction of the right of the citizens to bear arms in defence of themselves and the state will not be controverted by the court for though the citizens are forbid wearing weapons concealed in the manner described in the act they may nevertheless bear arms in any other admissible form but to be in conflict with the constitution it is not essential that the act should contain a prohibition against bearing arms in every possible form it is the right to bear arms in defence of the citizens and the state that is secured by the constitution and whatever restrains the full and complete exercise of that right though not an p 92 entire destruction of it is forbidden by the explicit language of the constitution
1464949 but the fact is that the vast majority of states protect the individual right to keep arms in constitutional provisions not under ordinary legistlation it is an unremarkable proposition that similar language in the us constitution would also protect individual rights at least with respect to the federal government
1464950 furthermore the state constitutional provisions protecting the right of the people to keep and bear arms would be pointless if they only related to those persons in the state militia as the states are empowered to arm those persons in the state militia by other provisions of those same constitutions
1464951 now that the court in heller was unanimous in finding and affirmative individual right this is a thorny issue for the op as this finding can not be dismissed as merely the product of an overzealous conservative viewpoint
1464952 instead what occurred in dc v heller was a 9 0 rejection of the state s rights and collective rights theories which denied any affirmative individual right
1464953 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
1464954 the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized
1464955 i submit that the police regulations of towns and counties are exclusively with the towns and counties and they have in no manner forfeited to the federal government to make those police regulations
1464956 i am not willing to undertake to enter the states for the purpose of punishing individual offenses against their authority committed by one citizen against the other we in my judgment have no constitutional authority to do that when this government was formed the general rights of person and property were left to be protected by the states and there they are left today
1464957 i do not know where in the government of the united states gets the constitutional authority to go into the states and establish police regulations
1464958 i do not favor interference in any degree by the national government with the local administration
1464959 can it be believed that under the jealousies prevailing against the general government at the adoption of the constitution the states meant to surrender the authority of preserving order of enforcing moral duties and restraining vice within their own territory
1464960 all those powers which relate to merely municipal legislation or which may be properly called internal police are not surrendered by the states or restrained and consequently in relation to those the authority of a state is complete unqualified and exclusive
1464961 estou muito bem em palermo vou ficar por c no pr ximo anos e quem sabe mesmo at ao fim do meu percurso como futebolista
1464962 dixie county is in effect thumbing its nose at the constitution by putting up this display
1464963 no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states
1464964 not exactly the words one would expect from someone who allegedly disabled the people under their local governments from having anything to do with religion publically
1464965 i most earnestly recommend it that a constitutional amendment be submitted to the legislatures of the several states for ratification making it the duty of each of the several states to establish and forever maintain free public schools adequate to the education of all the children in the rudimentary branches within their respective limits irrespective of sex color birthplace or religions forbidding the teaching in said schools of religious atheistic or pagan tenets and prohibiting the granting of any school funds or school taxes or any part thereof either by legislative municipal or other authority for the benefit or in aid directly or indirectly of any religious sect or denomination or in aid or for the benefit of any other object of any nature or kind whatever
1464966 judicially determined that the first eight amendments of the constitution were not limitations on the power of the states and it was apprehended that the same might be held of the provision of the second section fourth article
1464967 was deemed necessary for the enforcement as an express limitation upon the powers of the states
1464968 need to create a unique physical bond between the person carrying an id and the data which appears on it is essential in order to fight the worldwide forgeries should we succeed we would be able to create a nationwide database controlled as it should be by the state
1464969 forming such a database would harm the citizens basic right to privacy

1464977 while it has not been immune to the negative macroeconomic trends it appears that a number of companies in it and it employment are outperforming the general economy this is in stark contrast to the last major economic pullback where it and it employment dramatically underperformed the broader economy and job market
1464978 very text of the second amendment implicitly recognizes the pre existence of the right and declares only that it shall not be infringed
1464979 second amendment is naturally divided into two parts its prefatory clause and its operative clause the former does not limit the latter grammatically but rather announces a purpose
1464980 does not limit or expand the scope of the operative clause
1464981 nowhere else in the constitution does a right attributed to the people refer to anything other than an individual right
1464982 protecting only the right to keep and bear arms in an organized militia therefore fits poorly with the operative clauses description of the holder of that right as the people
1464983 strong presumption that the second amendment right is exercised individually and belongs to all americans
1464984 banning from the home the most preferred firearm in the nation to keep and use for protection of ones home and family would fail constitutional muster
1464985 find soldiers or men of arms either horsemen or footmen without the grant and assent of the people of this state by their representatives in senate and assembly except in the cases specially provided for by the constitution of the united states
1464986 this clearly ties the keeping and bearing of arms to those arms used for the collective arming of bodies of men
1464987 the words citizens of the united states and citizens of the states as employed in the fourteenth amendment did not change or modify the relations of citizens of the state and the nation as they existed under the original constitution
1464988 in numerous instances bear arms was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia
1464989 nothing more than the imposition of proper discipline and training
1464990 alternative to a standing army is a well regulated militia but this cannot exist unless the people are trained to bearing arms
1464991 the object of this clause is to secure a well armed militia
1464992 interpretation is confirmed by analogous armsbearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed adoption of the second amendment
1464993 the right of the citizens to bear arms in the defence of themselves shall not be questioned
1464994 that the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state and as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty they ought not to be kept up and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to and governed by the civil power
1464995 who is conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms be justly compelled thereto
1464996 the freemen of this commonwealth shall be armed and disciplined for its defence those who conscientiously scruple to bear arms shall not be compelled to do so but shall pay an equivalent for personal service
1464997 of ones person or house what he called the law of self preservation
1464998 this is one of our many renewals of the saxon regulations
1464999 one may assemble people together in order to protect and defend his house
1465000 should be considered as a citizen soldier because it is consistent with the very spirit of our government that every man should feel such a deep personal interest in it as that he would be willing to shoulder his musket at any time and not leave it to his neighbor to defend his possessions or the country which has given him birth
1465001 the right to bear arms is another important right guaranteed to all our citizens by the pennsylvania constitution
1465002 legislature the duty of so organizing and disciplining the whole body of the citizens that they shall be able not only to bear arms but to use them with confidence and skill in defense of themselves and the states if such a necessity shall arise
1465003 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
1465004 prevalent in the written documents of the founding period that we have found
1465005 no person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms
1465006 persons can neither be called upon for their services nor can an equivalent be demanded it is also attended with still further difficulties for a militia can never be depended upon
1465007 would lead to the violation of another article in the constitution which secures to the people the right of keeping arms and in this case recourse must be had to a standing army
1465008 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
1465009 that the subjects which are protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law
1465010 right has long been understood to be the predecessor to our second amendment
1465011 it was clearly an individual right having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia
1465012 was clearly an individual right having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia
1465013 protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law
1465014 great weight on james madisons inclusion of a conscientious objector clause in his original draft of the second amendment
1465015 persons conscientiously scrupulous should not be compelled to bear arms
1465016 what justice can there be in compelling them to bear arms when if they are honest men they would rather die than use them
1465017 the liberty of the press was to be unrestrained but he who used it was to be responsible in cases of its abuse like the right to keep fire arms which does not protect him who uses them for annoyance or destruction
1465018 analogy makes no sense if firearms could not be used for any individual purpose at all
1465019 that any person who shall carry any pistol dirk knife slung shot or deadly weapon within the city limits of harrisburg except police officers shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor
1465020 provided that nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent any citizen of the united states residing within this commonwealth from having a gun in his home or from using such gun in defense of either person or property or from shooting at targets or from hunting for or shooting at in any place in this commonwealth anything not protected by the laws of this commonwealth
1465021 every nobleman and gentleman comprised in the said second and third articles shall have liberty to ride with a sword and case of pistols if they think fit and keep a gun in their houses for the defence of the same or for fowling
1465022 the right to keep and bear arms for security or defense of self family home and others and for lawful common defense hunting recreational use and all other lawful purposes and such rights shall not be denied or infringed by the state or any subdivision thereof
1465023 being prohibited from carrying arms in an organized state militia
1465024 keep and bear arms in conformity to the state laws and to form a well regulated militia necessary to the security of a free state
1465025 a citizen possesses all his rights of citizenship from birth else he can never possess them legally as i have shown but some of these rights like the right to bear arms he does not exercise till the military age
1465026 unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia
1465027 all free male able bodied persons negroes mulattoes and indians excepted residents of the state between the ages of 18 and 45 years except such persons as now are or hereafter may be exempted by the laws of the united states or of this state and shall be armed equipped and trained as the general assembly may provide by law
1465028 to go or ride armed by night or by day
1465029 going around with unusual and dangerous weapons to the terror of the people
1465030 refers to the arms of the militia or soldier and does not authorize the carrying of weapons not adapted to use for military purposes
1465031 which provides that the people have the right to bear arms for their defense and security is a limitation on legislative power to enact laws prohibiting the bearing of arms in the militia or any other military organization provided for by law
1465032 it may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service m 16 rifles and the like may be banned then the second amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause but as we have said the conception of the militia at the time of the second amendments ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty
1465033 the second amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes such as self defense within the home
1465034 protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia
1465035 all the arms and accoutrements without exception may be branded and if anything has been stopped from the soldiers for their arms i will order it to be returned
1465036 the second amendment has no such qualifier of capable individuals to bear arms under state militia laws on the right of the people to keep and bear arms furthermore such a qualifier applied to state rkba provisions would render the protection useless
1465037 i was thinking of coxes description of what became the second amendment confirms the people in their right to keep and bear their private arms
1465038 note that in both rkba provisions and militia laws keep arms refers to the action of individual persons not collective action of stockpiling of arms in state armorys
1465039 confirms the people in their right to keep and bear their private arms
1465040 in the absence of any law forbidding pistols or shotguns at home anyone would have a right to have such items and such have nothing to do with militia laws why do you have a right to possess a flashlight at home you have a right because there is no law to the contrary you don t need a constitutional provision to keep a flashlight or even a law to do so
1465041 resistance to sudden violence for the preservation not only of my person my limbs and life but of my property is an indisputable right of nature which i have never surrendered to the public by the compact of society and which perhaps i could not surrender if i would
1465042 the constitution preserves the advantage of being armed which americans possess over the people of almost every other nation where the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms
1465043 the whole of that bill of rights is a declaration of the right of the people at large or considered as individuals i t establishes some rights of the individual as unalienable and which consequently no majority has a right to deprive them of
1465044 so would you read the right to keep and bear arms as relating to the actions of individuals since individuals had been subject to militia laws leading up to the second amendment and had a duty to keep arms under those militia laws would not the natural reading of the right of the people to keep and bear arms be that individuals have a right to keep arms
1465045 individuals had been subject to militia laws leading up to the second amendment
1465046 tench coxe thought so and nearly all of the early state court decisions read it that way
1465047 what does this tell us about the right to keep arms if the individual had a duty to keep arms would one not say that the individual has a right to keep arms as protected by 2a
1465048 larry said do you think any individual had the right under state militia law to keep and bring to the musket field a pistol or shotgun when the law demanded a 41 rifled barrel 42 inches in length end quote
1465049 no but why do you ask the difference between a duty and a right is clear to me
1465050 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
1465051 the 1792 federal militia act requires individuals to supply the arms as had the early state militia acts see us v miller for discussion of ealry state militia acts note that virginia s miliita act used the word keep in reference to individuals arming and equipping themselves
1465052 act for the recovery of arms and accoutrements belonging to the state
1465053 the federal government was not going to supply arms to this militia therefore in order for this militia to even exist the people had to own and keep firearms
1465054 for nra pundits heller will be held in the same esteem as roe v wade is to pro choice advocates and like roe deserve to be overturned because neither deserves to be called law
1465055 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1465056 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1465057 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1465058 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1465059 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1465060 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1465061 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1465062 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
1465063 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
1465064 their bodies wont be able to tolerate pregnancy and delivering children

1465067 tires are the rodney dangerfield of the automotive world even though theyre the only component of the car that actually touches the pavement tires get no respect savvy consumers are seeking to increase fuel economy and the life of their tires by paying more attention to those rubber objects that are attached to their vehicle
1465068 and this latest gambit will surely bring yet more head shaking disappointment from some quarters about mccain resorting to juvenile tactics
1465069 concerend citizen so your solution to lost jobs is a higher corporate tax rate driving more jobs overseas fixing unaffordable health care by creating the largest government buracracy the world has ever seen you are obviously part of the generation of entitlement that feels a college education is a god given right
1465070 bho hussein obama osamaobama obama is an elitist omg hes so arrogant look at him hes got people cheering at him he must think hes god he thinks hes the second coming of christ omg he even said it fox news was the first and still remain the original source of this blatant lie yet people still insist obama called himself that
1465071 if americans took obamas advice they would save about 800 000 barrels of oil a day
1465072 i ll have that debate with senator mccain any where at any time
1465073 just days after john mccain reversed himself on offshore drilling ten senior hess corporation executives and hess family members each plowed 28 500 into the rncs committee to elect mccain president
1465074 we need a president who will increase our oil supply
1465075 american based companies are shipping record amounts of gasoline and diesel fuel to other countries a record 1 6 million barrels a day in u s refined petroleum products were exported during the first four months of this year up 33 percent from 1 2 million barrels a day over the same period in 2007 shipments this february topped 1 8 million barrels a day for the first time during any month according to final numbers from the energy department
1465076 if domestic oil production is so urgent why cant the oil companies drill on the 68 million acres of land and sea they are already lisensed to drill and why dont they export less of what they already drill

1465093 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1465094 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking

1465102 it appears that the weak economic numbers coming out of the uk will put pressure on the eurozone to worry more about growth and less about inflation and perhaps cut interest rates

1465111 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1465112 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1465113 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee

1465115 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1465116 my view has been all along and it remains that the fed is going to be on hold for a good deal of time

1465147 4 9 brigade who shipped out for iraq in march 2007
1465148 the enemys the same almost its not fighting like it should be they just blow our stuff up and run off i always knew when we went over that the vietnam guys would be behind us because they know what its like to fight an enemy that doesnt fight right
1465149 as soon as i heard they were coming home i told my wife i said im going
1465150 said johnny guidry 60 who flew in from raceland la
1465151 they needed closure just like i did they needed a response from their people they needed a response from their older brothers like we are and yes a welcome home
1465152 i think the american people have realized they blamed the wrong people in vietnam
1465153 theres been a realization that if you are unhappy with the war the fact is the military guys go because they were told to go
1465154 why couldnt anybody from the community have shown up you dont need a son or a dad or a husband coming home to come out and welcome them home
1465155 it was one of the most horrible experiences of my entire life
1465156 i came home pretty much just a mental wreck i would wake up sweating and fighting in the night and my first wife didnt know how to deal with that to tell you the truth i didnt either
1465157 i could see a lot of similarities between the two wars there was a country split over the rightness or wrongness of the war but i wanted to really talk about the experience of these guys individually and how most all of them found themselves there not because you know they didnt sign up to go fight the communists it was the kennedy era the whole ask what you can do for your country thing they were doing what was asked of them
1465158 unfortunate sons a true story of young men and war
1465159 i had spent from 1968 to about 1997 never having talked to another manchu
1465160 all of a sudden you had someone to talk to about the experiences the years that had gone by someone who you knew would understand what you were talking about
1465161 old man look at my life im a lot like you were
1465162 it was a very very challenging fight heavily entrenched insurgents a very dangerous place theres just no other way to put it we worked very hard there for about nine months and the soldiers made a tremendous difference it became a much safer place
1465163 we know a lot of vietnam vets suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and one of the reasons they suffered so much was because when they got home people didnt recognize what theyd done in a good way their buddies werent with them and most guys just buried it and thats the worst thing you can do
1465164 so ive talked with some of these older guys and i think they can help i know they will try
1465165 one thing has not changed and never will the bond that grew out of our shared experiences after what all of you have been through together i am sure you feel it too and i am sure that 40 years from now you will still feel it when you look back on those days
1465166 did they get it do they understand what it means to be thinking about it every day after 40 long years for gods sake hold on to each other
1465167 in the flurry of backyard barbecues and visits to old friends now in the years ahead when youre building your families figuring out how to send your kids to college getting laid off from your job dont forget these strong young men standing beside you you will need them
1465168 i wanted them to know that im grateful for their service
1465169 you know we never came to a consensus that this is how we as americans feel about the vietnam experience we just stopped talking about it
1465170 but for us its still there whatever we did we didnt deserve to be ignored
1465171 inflation is still an issue and certainly the first half of the year was a big burden on consumer spending
1465172 consumers appear to be acting rationally in a very uncertain economic environment

1465229 we have had some frustrations and roadblocks in our current situation at sydney olympic park
1465230 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1465231 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1465232 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1465233 they clearly requested that the interahamwes contine to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1465234 we have not yet read the report which has not been sent to us by the rwandan government we are therefore not in a position to react
1465235 say there will be a response but that clarification is needed on certain points of the offer
1465236 theyve hit the ball back we must analyse whether its just another way to gain time or if its serious

1465248 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1465249 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law

1465251 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law

1465255 therefore i am grateful that this was brought to the attention of the proper authority and my hope would be that some sanctions would be taken because i do think that these young children were not treated with respect and they should not have been there in the first place

1465382 its still what i feel is my favourite dillinger record at the time we recorded it it was such a tumultuous time for the band we were just happy to get through it with the whole chris pennie ex drummer thing it was almost impossible to make the record and when we were done with it there was this feeling of wow we really accomplished something with this but i also thought that maybe after some time i wouldnt feel as strongly about it maybe it was just the initial feeling of overcoming the obstacles but a year later i still feel like its our best record and theres nothing about it i would change in any way if i could go back were just looking forward now the record already feels old to us now because a lot of the songs were written even a year and a half before we actually recorded them were at the tail end of our touring cycle we have probably a couple more months of touring for this record and im just excited to start writing now its more of what i want to do right now were off of relapse so theres a lot of exciting things going on im not in any hurry to do anything and i dont want to sign to anybody it seems so unnecessary now to sign a contract thats based on an industry model that doesnt exist anymore relapse did everything they could for us and everything is cool with them but after being on the same label for ten years it feels unbelievable to know that we could literally self fund a cd and just put it out the way nine inch nails and radiohead did we can do whatever we want yknow the fact that we managed to not get big but big enough means that we have enough of a cult following that people might buy just as many records from us as they would from a store theres no point of having a record label behind you unless you have a chance of becoming a walmart band like nickelback or some huge entity we dont really foresee that in our future i think were starting to get to the point where we view bands like nine inch nails and radiohead as our peers and even bands like aphex twin those are forward thinking bands we see ourselves regardless of any genre of music and we dont see ourselves aligned just with heavy bands like i said before we have a cult following and were not little but were not big im happy with where we are and if we can just maintain the same quality control over our stuff as nine inch nails and radiohead do ill be happy trent reznor and radiohead have control over every single aspect of their band even though theyre enormous every single thing about nine inch nails feels like nine inch nails and every single thing about radiohead feels like radiohead and thats amazing considering how big those two are for us thats what we want not having a label involved makes it so much easier i realized that shooting videos is pretty worthless for us who cares about that our videos are never going to be on mtvs trl and i dont think being on at three in the morning is really worth it when i look at youtube the videos that have been played the most are the videos people took on their camera phones of us playing live its not videos that we spent 10 000 of a labels money on i think thats a good place for us to be in that radiohead nine inch nails paradigm
1465383 dude i hear about that every day laughs theres not a day that goes by that i dont hear about that laughs i was involved in a lawsuit and they used that video against me and i was torn because i thought the video was really awesome but then i was worried that the video was going to be the bane of my existence laughs its funny though because that video is the most viewed dillinger video on the internet by far its not even close and i didnt know they were filming we didnt have make up crews or crazy cameras or all that it was some guy with a camera in a store and he just caught energy and something about this band that you cannot replicate with a budget and a ton of people and lighting crews and stuff i feel that for a band like us where seeing us live is such an important part of our band were never going to capture that in a studio with video cameras and that so when i see that the virgin megastore video and its got 600 000 views and then i see the video for black bubblegum has 15 000 views i wonder why were even doing videos they dont even matter
1465384 its funny because we took a lot of time off to write ire works and i realized that the video was becoming almost like a viral thing it was on websites that had nothing to do with music the sites were like look at this crazy band and the longer we were off the more i couldnt believe what happened in that video i started to feel like old people laughs i asked myself is this what happens at shows laughs i didnt even understand that i was the person in that video and i even asked myself why i did that it was fuckin pretty insane i could have hurt somebody but then you start playing again and you realize thats just what happens at shows laughs
1465385 its funny because that was the last word written on miss machine we were in the studio and sunshine the werewolf was written in its entirety the line after that therell be another just like you and all that stuff it was all written but i had to have something in that one spot it had to be something crushing and i couldnt think of anything phrase that would do that part justice it was totally a case of what word fits this kind of apocalyptic moment when we thought about it in the context of the song we all thought that the part needed to destroy that word to us is pretty much everything we are trying to do as a band its funny because in terms of the song you can read into it a lot of different ways lyrically but for me i feel that thats what were about but its not destroy in a way that youre trying to break down old things so much but its more that youre trying to be the absolute excellence of every single thing youre trying to do when were on stage we want to crush everybody when were in the studio we want to crush every expectation to us that word if people had to encapsulate our band in a word that would probably be what i would want its funny because there wasnt that much thought put into it it was more that we had to record and we only had ten more minutes to figure out what word was going to go into the part i didnt know what we were going to do and i had a bunch of lyrics that were not impactful enough for that point but then i thought of destroyer at first i thought it was silly i thought it was cartoon ish word and taken out of context it sounds silly but for the part in the song it just feels like its the part like you said something about it just connected with people in a way and now its the part in our set where every single person wants to sing the part in the mic with us theyre like me me me and thats cool because i didnt envision it being that way
1465386 a lot of people see our band as a ball of negative energy or they used to see us like that i dont thrive off of negative energy at all not that were super positive as a band in our message but i really feel were more about excelling and overcoming things were more about that than this negative nihilistic view or something like that like i said the word destroyer is not meant in the sense of everything sucks and fuck everything its meant as going out and really doing your best at everything and crushing everything in your path hopefully it is inspirational for people in a way
1465387 yeah because as you get older youre not as pissed anymore im not and i cant fake it i went through a period when we first started touring for this record where i knew going into it i didnt feel the way i felt when i was like 21 22 years old like 22 years old or 21 i was fuckin on stage and like a ball of fire and it wasnt in a positive way it was more expelling things things i was pissed at where youre a kid youre pissed at everything now im at a point in my life where im really not mad about anything and i wonder how the fuck im going to be in dillinger escape plan and go on stage where these kids and people think were this ball of anger but were not i dont feel that way anymore i feel our energy has shifted to where now i feel even more energetic but its not in the fuck you kind of way its almost like a celebration of sorts of being on top of your game knowing were operating at our highest potential and knowing when i see people in the crowd with us theres a communal vibe they get it were doing something really hard to get for most people but the crowd is there and they get it and its just a different feeling for me now man i still feel as energetic but not as pissed off at all i dont have that everything sucks attitude anymore even if everything does suck im not upset about it laughs
1465388 thats true man and it sounds like weird hippie bullshit and im sure if i was 13 and heard someone saying that id be like what fuck that man but i dont ever want to feel like im doing theatre or that im a caricature of something that i used to be i had to feel where the energy was coming from and it was just a different place its still there and it feels more genuine for kids in the crowd they feel more with us rather than watching this spectacle of aggression theyre not as much of a spectator anymore i feel the same way about converge its very similar when you see them its not just being pissed off theres this big community vibe of energy its almost positivity even though they sound like the end of the world theres still something weirdly uplifting about it maybe its overcoming adversity or knowing that youre doing something difficult and still succeeding at it
1465389 were in good shape on the outside laughs thats the trick because inside i feel like im 50 years old laughs its difficult man i try to eat super healthy and obviously this is band is physically very demanding none of us are people that take that for granted even being slightly anything when you go on stage fucks you in this band if youre anything off if youre dehydrated or anything you can feel it we dont take a lot of days off well play 30 dates and only take maybe one or two days off and aside from needing the energy every night were constantly breaking bones and all that and you just have to keep rolling just this year ive broken my left hand my right wrist and i tore my left rotator cuff but you just have to keep going on tour its very simple i just eat well and i drink a lot of water i dont really beat the shit out of myself working out on tour because we have to play its more that when im at home i work out a lot and when im on tour i kind of just coast and eat well maybe some days ill do push ups a lot people probably think im going to the gym all the time at home i am but on tour i save everything for playing

1465394 kita mesti mempersiapkan ekonomi kita untuk persaingan selanjutnya dan menarik lebih ramai pelabur dan isu ini menimbulkan ketakutan dalam pemikiran sesetengah pemimpin
1465395 saya tidak melihat kemungkinan menjadi destinasi pelaburan yang menarik melainkan adanya perubahan drastik dari segi dasar
1465396 jika kita mahukan tindakan afirmatif biarlah ia untuk golongan yang tertindas tanpa mengira kaum dan bukan setakat kaum melayu
1465397 dasar ini perlu diperbaiki supaya tidak hanya menguntungkan mereka yang mempunyai hubungan politik namun untuk menghapuskannya melayu belum bersedia untuk bersaing secara adil dan belum bersedia untuk meritokrasi
1465398 in the event of a decision against iran this country will suffer the same outcome as iraq iran is not any stronger than iraq and wont have the means to resist a military attack on its own
1465399 the challenges are greater and exceed irans ability to reply
1465400 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1465401 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1465402 real ale is a natural living product so there is a much greater intensity of flavours
1465403 one of our objectives is to get people to try it there are fruit beers wheat beers porters stouts milds and golden ales its incredibly diverse so theres something to meet everyones tastes
1465404 pasteurising and filtering a beer kills off a lot of the natural flavours
1465405 a processed keg beer is completely inert a dead flat liquid drawn up to bar with carbon dioxide to put some life in it thats why theyre so fizzy compared to a real ale

1465408 if the judge rules against him in september the appeal process could drag for at least a year or two well after the election
1465409 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1465410 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime
1465411 documents describing the creation of explosives as well as excerpts from the anarchists arsenal
1465412 siddiquis papers included descriptions of various landmarks in the united states including in new york city
1465413 may the blood of unintelligible be directly on your unintelligible possibly head or hands
1465414 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1465415 it was shocking but good for the first couple of minutes i was in shock but it was a phone call i had been waiting for and then things just started happening iggor came to phoenix and i decided to invite him to make a record so that started everything and it was very cool
1465416 no but thats one of the things i think is cool about this record the way it turned out is based on what we like to play we wanted to play this style when we recorded this album and thats how it was i never make a plan we didnt have a concept or anything it just started rolling we said that inflikted could be the name of the album and cavalera conspiracy could be the name of the band in fact the first song inflikted was a soulfly song kind of it wasnt officially a soulfly song but it had started as that i do my songs before the band i do my own writing and then i bring them to the rest of the band but the main bulk of the song is created at home or while touring or whatever but inflikted was going to be for soulfly but ended up being a cavalera song and i thought that was cool i liked that we were able to do that
1465417 oh yeah it was killer i think it was even better this time because we just enjoyed it more and we knew we were going to make some killer shit together sometimes in the past there were distractions that shouldnt have been there like other people talking about what kind of hotel we were staying in or what kind of food we were going to eat and that didnt have anything to do with the music but i was always pissed about that stuff i didnt get that the outside influence of those people was a lot of bullshit with iggor this time none of that shit is happening we were going to make a record we didnt give a fuck where we were staying or what we were eating we were making a record its a lot like the early sepultura days instead of the later sepultura days
1465418 oh yeah and thats great for both me and for iggor
1465419 definitely its killer man its better than i thought it would be there have been a lot of good reviews and theres been good fan reaction which is what i go mostly by they go crazy for these songs they go as crazy for them as they do for the sepultura or nailbomb stuff and that can only make me happy im playing sanctuary or doom of all fires and theyre singing and screaming and going nuts thats a killer reaction and i couldnt expect anything more
1465420 yeah but not on a pace like soulfly i dont know how or when well get together but sometime itll happen and well do another record and some more touring but thats whats cool about it theres no pressure you dont have to do anything we just do it when we feel like it
1465421 i dont know its the soulfly way im used to it even my friends are like wow youre making records all the time and touring theyre more amazed about the touring than the records because im always on tour soulfly is a really interesting band because i really had to start over i left sepultura on the top and i had to start from the bottom and that was a crazy experience of redoing everything again but i did it by the book and i never complained i just took the punches i went back to all the fucked up places and ive never really complained i just went with it laughs
1465422 psychologically its fucked up a lot of people just dont believe its going to work they put you down a lot youve got to really have extra fuckin confidence to take it and even i didnt have that sometimes there were times when i thought fuck this man im done with this shit but the music carried me man and the fans it was a different road to start all over again but i think it was good it made the music more interesting again the music created by soulfly on the six albums are a unique way if i would have stayed with sepultura i probably would have done something completely different im not saying it would have been worse or better i have no idea but soulfly was definitely more influenced by struggle its really about struggle from the beginning to now its been about struggle and i like that
1465423 its kind of a crazy album actually i like it but its kind of weird making albums like dark ages and conquer i think i prefer to play those its more up my alley its back to me doing what i do like you said its the 360 degrees thing dark ages conquer and inflikted are really what i do its my thing yknow whereas with the first soulfly some of the elements on it werent my thing there was weird shit on it like jazz sessions and weird shit like brazilian jazz and i dont know much about that shit i thought it would be cool to throw some of that in there and at the time i had all these guests so it was like uh ok you guys do something so i guess you can say theres two sides of the coin to that record with the experimental side its fuckin killer it was unafraid to take chances and there was a very punk spirit on that first album and with primitive they dont have a punk sound but they have a punk spirit they were all about not giving a fuck and doing whatever you feel like but conquer is more of a metal spirit its just brutal shit its not really experimental but its shit to rip your face off laughs so im glad ive got both its kind of cool maybe if there was only one influence people would be tired of it by now including myself
1465424 its through the music some of it most of it maybe 90 came from old stuff believe it or not it started with prophecy i started listening to a lot of massacre rediscovering that whole death metal thing that i loved in the sepultura days i was also listening to a lot of hardcore bands like discharge sick of it all cro mags gbh soulfly really isnt influenced by new music much at all its weird its really influenced by old morbid angel kind of metal laughs and discharge and that shit i think thats alright those albums to me have passed the test of time its brutal stuff i love the attitude on those records and ive tried to go back to that spirit i didnt want to copy it but i wanted to use that kind of inspiration even going to the studio ill jam a lot of massacre in my car on the way to the studio so my head is really metal when i go to the studio laughs its cool i think people around me are actually surprised theyre saying max is doing some crazy shit now but i still like dub a lot thats the only music that i listen to apart from metal that i like as much like really crazy dub with heavy crazy bass i dont get into a lot of other stuff and ive really gotten back into metal over the last five years
1465425 i love refuse resist i think its anarchy music its good music for riots i always thought if i was in a riot this is the riff id want to hear laughs its like calling for war and during that part in the middle of the song i started doing this during soulfly shows i ask the crowd to open the biggest pit they can and they do thats the best part of playing the song live refuse resist is definitely a proud song i love that song its always a great song to play its got that fuckin riot material laughs thats very difficult to do sometimes the riff actually came from faith no more believe it or not its from the song small victory its a very subtle riff and jim martin faith no more guitar player is just playing it very softly and i heard it and i thought that if i did that sort of thing but loudly it would be sick laughs so thats how the song was born
1465426 i know as much as you laughs im only in charge of my part and it takes more than just me as far as my part goes i would like to do it fuck yeah im interested
1465427 i told everybody that im not one of those musicians that hates my past in fact im the opposite i love what im doing at the moment but im also very proud of my work in the past even with the fucked up shit on morbid visions i like those albums i listen to them and i see them differently now thats a killer record its a crazy record we were young and theres a kind of raw anger in that shit that could have only come out at that time and could have only come out that way its unbelievable and completely unique morbid visions is out of tune the album is out of tune but its raw and fucked up i would even like to ask jairo guedes original sepultura guitar player who played on morbid visions to come with us on tour for me that would be really cool sepultura had ten or 12 years before andreas even joined the band so it would be cool i get the feeling from talking to people that theres a whole wave of brutal death metal and black metal in brazil that is influenced by morbid visions and they love that shit its really strong in the underground and because of that i feel its something important maybe not as important as refuse resist because that shit became bigger and its the same with roots but morbid visions is important too that death metal period was fucking bad ass it was us and death massacre morbid angel kreator slayer destruction and celtic frost creating that we were all the beginning of the death thrash thing on its own its a special time in music metal will never be like that again it was a cool time for metal and when death and thrash came out it was like holy shit we were like fuck the poser bands we liked fast hardcore fucked up metal whats not to like laughs it was great you didnt need to play that well and your attitude was fucking bad ass and all you had to do was go there and fuck shit up i love it man that part of me is always here it never went away

1465478 poor people have been voting for democrats for 50 years and theyre still poor
1465479 much of u s medical care particularly the everyday business of preventing and treating routine illnesses is inferior in quality wastefully dispensed and inequitably financed
1465480 the time has come for radical change the management of medical care is too important to leave to doctors who are after all not managers to begin with
1465481 those who talked about health care planning in the 1970s now talk about health care marketing
1465482 the organizational culture of medicine used to be dominated by the ideals of professionalism and voluntarism which softened the underlying acquisitive activity
1465483 the restraints exercised by those ideals now grows weaker the health center of one era is the profit center of the next
1465484 add this to our series of failed health care leaders from the
1465485 in a story in the miami herald ceo sacco was quoted we thought we had a rising star
1465486 we have heard that but were not sure how to handle it
1465487 developing a licensure process for leaders of health care organizations licensing doctors and health professionals has been going on for a long time but now leaders of health care organizations from hospitals to drug companies have as much if not more influence over health care and hence the health and safety of patients as do doctors yet
1465488 there are no requirements that leaders of health care organizations have any particular educational background knowledge commitment to health care values or for that matter that they have not committed crimes given the scope of bad leadership discussed on health care renewal maybe a licensing process for health care executives would at least ensure that they have not served time in the brig for theft
1465489 as the pendulum swings back from lay leader to clinician leader there is a strong and appropriate opportunity for physicians to reinsert themselves into a leadership role
1465490 in fact the time has perhaps never been more appropriate than today in a health care system that is complex troubled and challenging the physician ceo brings a unique set of skills to the business of medicine t he successful physician leader however must understand the business of medicine as well as or better than he or she understands the practice of medicine training developing and equipping our future physician leaders with the necessary skill sets will be one of medicines many challenges as it expands into the 21st century

1465492 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1465493 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1465494 race played absolutely no roll in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1465495 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1465496 im upset because my reporter was singled out for whatever reason that bothers me were just trying to figure out what that reason was
1465497 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio workers makes in a year
1465498 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1465499 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1465500 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook

1465508 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again hes the original maverick one is ready to lead mccain
1465509 being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1465510 this plan will not lower prices today it will not lower prices during the next administration the truth is we wouldnt see a drop of oil from john mccains plan for at least the next seven years

1465706 a project labor agreement pla is a construction labor agreement between an owner and a regional building trades council representing all the construction craft unions in a given geographical area plas are agreements that establish uniform terms and conditions for all construction craft employees as well as all construction contractors on a specific construction project each pla is specific to one project only
1465707 we find that the presence of a pla increases a projects base construction bids by 27 per square foot in 2004 prices relative to non pla projects
1465708 do plas really have no impact on costs if not whats going on here
1465709 i saw first hand communities were being devastated by these developments
1465710 it would have changed the look and life in the village having a monastery in its midst it provided secure employment and new skills were passed on to local workers and since that time the village of cartmel has continued to evolve theres no one time when you can say thats how cartmel has always been or that it should always be
1465711 i am concerned that the siting will affect this whole area and the special cartmel experience
1465712 you have to demonstrate that this wind farm will impose environmental economic and social impact that cant be properly monitored
1465713 i am quite certain that the stribers proposal is really not justified by the supposed benefits
1465714 to build it will cost about 15m and they will pay about 1 5m to the landowners in rental and there are other costs but that is still a lot of money
1465715 we will be four square behind stop to prevent this development going forward
1465716 they are as entitled to put in any application they like just as i am to put an application in to put up a garage there are two landowners but we have to fight the developers they are farmers and trying to do their best
1465717 still this proposed increase will not fully eliminate the utilitys structural deficit it will bring bwl an additional 8 4 million per full year 6 4 million from electricity 1 5 million from water and 500 000 from steam
1465718 but in the current fiscal year the utility will see about 3 million in added revenue
1465719 bwl officials have said they anticipate additional rate increases in future years to assure their finances are stable that being the case continued efforts to trim expenses and improve efficiency will be critical bwls customers deserve no less
1465720 bwl rates utility should pour out information in pursuit of rate increases
1465721 if you dont agree with something i do i want to know
1465722 the lansing country club membership is a banquet facilities membership only the cheapest one which runs 2880 year

1465724 among larks successes lain said have been turning the bwls 6 million budget deficit in 2006 07 into a 12 million surplus in 2007 08 and inking a deal with detroit edison to combine coal train shipping operations a move expected to save the utility 25 million a year over the next two years
1465725 we look at two primary opportunities to have a huge positive impression on growing cattle
1465726 the first two days of life the calves can be taught to be handled efficiently the next window of opportunity is the day they are separated from their mothers and asked to change an address if we can wed like to prepare calves to be confident to accept change and short periods of stress if we are unable to do that our next priority is to greet freshly weaned calves at a backgrounding yard or a feedlot
1465727 you can teach them quickly as they are being unloaded to stop and turn around and go away from you as cattle are being taken from an alley to a home pen each time they have an opportunity to pass by us it creates more confidence in them our goal is to take the anxiety out of the nervous sentinel animals while at the same time build confidence in the other animals
1465728 its important to identify the initiator or sentinel animal and remove the anxiety from those initiators and guide the herd around the pen
1465729 the purpose is to observe and read each group of calves and implement the time required
1465730 this is important as we want to encourage bunk activity to teach these cattle to volunteer to go the bunk we dont want to push them we want to put the whole herd in a corner and teach them to go by a handler go straight and go to the bunk
1465731 you are much more likely to have newly arrived calves express their true state of health when they trust you
1465732 our main purpose in investing time as we receive these calves is to create a situation where they are willing to eat rest and hydrate and most importantly quickly express their true health status
1465733 the tolerance of that behavior is probably the number one mistake i see
1465734 those are people who need to be doing other things around the feedyard
1465735 if youre happy and you know it clap your hands
1465736 today were going to talk about the scourge of the church the one thing that does more to destroy religion and ruin homes than any other thing

1465743 one more form of unbelief that we need to talk about is the unbelief of a haughty spirit or pride there is a very close relationship between unbelief and pride here is how i would describe that relationship unbelief is a turning away from jesus or god in order to seek satisfaction in other things pride is a turning away from god specifically to take satisfaction in self covetousness is a turning away from god to find satisfaction in things impatience is turning away from god to find satisfaction in your own swift plan of action lust is turning away from god to find satisfaction in sex bitterness is turning away from god to find satisfaction in retaliation but deeper than all these forms of unbelief is the unbelief of pride because self determination and self exaltation lie behind all these other sinful dispositions so it is fitting that the last sin we take up in our series is the deepest one namely pride or an arrogant spirit and it is especially fitting during advent because the coming of the son of god in the form of man was an extraordinary act of humility and self denial when i call pride a form of unbelief the practical implication is this the battle against pride is the battle against unbelief or to put it positively the fight for humility is the fight of faith
1465744 the trick is to eat what ever fruit and vegetable that is in season because that is the way god meant it to be
1465745 we talked in a cluttered office where he sat in front of a blackboard covered with scribbled graphs and equations

1465777 there was always a hope that we could pick ourselves up for this game and there was also a matter of pride of playing in europe again

1465781 there was a strong demand from both the patient and his wife for a transplant and the operation
1465782 the main hurdle is the functional recovery said dr w p andrew lee chief of plastic surgery at the university of pittsburgh medical center
1465783 some of the considerations for a penile transplant are the same as for a hand or
1465784 because of the wifes psychological rejection as well as the swollen shape of the transplanted penis the surgeons report in the journal
1465785 few realize the extent to which the government will go to use paranormal abilities in solving problems with critical national implications we want to demonstrate this reality in authentic settings
1465786 joe will bring a real world feel to the new series so that viewers can see how anomalous phenomena sometimes interact with current military and intelligence applications
1465787 the interesting developments going on in physics lately have brought us to where science fact is outstripping science fiction wormholes and warp drives quantum entanglement and teleportation multidimensional universes these are now standard fare in mainstream science journals
1465788 based on this phenomena that would have seemed outrageous even just a decade or two ago cannot now be rejected out of hand without careful scrutiny the playing field of reality has expanded
1465789 having people like joe mcmoneagle and hal puthoff involved in the development of the series helps to place the show in a context of realism that many episodic shows dealing with anomolous phenomena often lack
1465790 we feel it is important is to strike a balance between challenging the audience with story questions while at the time avoiding audience frustration which can sometimes set in when questions outweigh answers
1465791 it is important to give the audience a payoff when they are tuned in to the stories you are telling
1465792 one challenge for any contemporary series is to balance the more episodic oriented shows with those shows dealing with a longer term plot arc we want to satisfy both types of viewers and sometimes that is difficult to do
1465793 however by focusing on longer term plot elements that viewers are aware of in the real world it becomes much easier to tune in to an individual episode and understand what is going on despite the fact it may be a longer term plot arc
1465794 we envision a series that includes elements of several very successful programs yet is a distinctly new concept in the way these ideas are brought together
1465795 the series concept combines an exciting synergy involving u s military and intelligence people who show themselves to be very human with emerging and mysterious phenomena that fascinate millions of people around the world

1465806 paid for the whole campaign out of his swear jar
1465807 you know hes new he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency hes a got a funny name
1465808 when john mccain gets up there and says id rather win an election than win a war when he says i didnt visit the troops when i was overseas even though every media outlet says thats just not true it suggests you are not trying to solve problems all you are trying to do is divide people so you can win an election that is nothing to be proud of lets have a real honest debate about policies that are going to make a difference in peoples lives
1465809 arrogant pompous elitist unstable and verbally abusive to his wife and colleagues
1465810 a few months ago i wrote that john mccain was an honorable man and he would run an honorable campaign
1465811 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
1465812 i had the courage and the judgment to say that i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that senator obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1465813 when john mccain gets up there and says id rather win an election than win a war when he says i didnt visit the troops when i was overseas even though every media outlet says thats just not true it suggests you are not trying to solve problems all you are trying to do is divide people so you can win an election that is nothing to be proud of lets have a real honest debate about policies that are going to make a difference in peoples lives
1465814 you cant say anything against obama without being called racist
1465815 everything that comes out of his lips is a pander lie
1465816 it suggests you are not trying to solve problems all you are trying to do is divide people so you can win an election that is nothing to be proud of lets have a real honest debate about policies that are going to make a difference in peoples lives
1465817 remove the regulations and or bail us out or thousands of jobs will be lost
1465818 mcacin wants to keep troops in iraq for 100 years
1465819 you cannot call proper vehicle maintenance a solution to the energy problem
1465820 if you are not going to do those things obama is not going to make you magically start doing them
1465821 for very little effort you could help out and save money
1465822 if you dont already take care of your car you are probably part of the non voting mouth breathing part of america
1465823 the real solution to gas being so high is doing something about how hard the oil companies are us right now
1465824 ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country
1465825 well while you may disagree with global warming doesnt it suck breathing in smoggy air cant be good for kids right well lets clean that up
1465826 some of us put that lame bribe in a savings account some of us do what we can to make ends meet even checking our tires and maintaining our crappy oil guzzling american made cars since you repugs refuse to offer any alternative
1465827 theres a blogger thats asserting the person making the assertion is a forensics expert
1465828 the american people will just drive that much more if they can squeeze another mile out of their tank
1465829 the oil companies and i want to be perfectly clear on this point are private businesses and theres not a damn thing politicians can do to make them lower their prices
1465830 if it really is cheaper to go 55 then why does my truck get 2 mpg more at 72
1465831 wow i just came up with my energy policy with this idea and no others i will steal the election
1465832 so that would meet about 1 of our demand two decades from now
1465833 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time you know and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1465834 remember the prisoners as though in prison with them and those who are ill treated since you yourselves also are in the body

1465840 for the coming of the son of man will be just like the days of noah for as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered the ark and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away so will the coming of the son of man be then there will be two men in the field one will be taken and one will be left two women will be grinding at the mill one will be taken and one will be left therefore be on the alert for you do not know which day your lord is coming

1465866 watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house
1465867 as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbors drive it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1465868 its a disappointing end to the tournament not to play the climax but obviously we achieved our goal to qualify so were pretty happy
1465869 its going to be great india theyre world champions theyre a great team and to get to test yourself against the best teams in the world is what the world cups all about
1465870 obviously bangladesh would be one of the closest teams to us on a level playing field but theyre still going to be a tough opposition to beat
1465871 we saw that when we went over into their back garden twenty20s another format of the game they wont be easy opposition but were looking forward to it
1465872 im just delighted with how it all went and to be headed to england

1465875 we can see clearly that these forces are trying to wage a psychological and violent battle against the olympics
1465876 they want to turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning for china
1465877 for these two people it is very clear that they are part of violent terrorist forces
1465878 we stay in our bedrooms and the dining rooms not in the open
1465879 im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1465880 i was up here last september and the smog was a lot worse then
1465881 the world and spiritualism both are important this is duty of every human being to strike a balance between his her worldly duties and quest of god if you will ignore one for another mahahmaya the great goddess who run this world will punish you asarams other teaching is that guru is greater than god so its ok if you worship the guru and forget the rest never have a doubt on your guru and just do not argue if he says something on the contrary ramkrishna parmhans never tried to curb the analyzing power of their disciples and he always encouraged them to develop their own personality he always told his disciples to keep an eye on the activities of your guru you must know that if his a true guru or fake one when vivekanada asked ramkrishna the question if he had ever seen the god he replied
1465882 screw the drama i have a free trip to japan

1465884 the massachusetts marketplace remains much in demand among hoteliers with its high barriers to new entry and top tier destination locations
1465885 while the economy has cooled we continue to see large numbers of interested buyers and sellers in the hotel industry with our firms transactions exceeding 1 billion through june the expectations gap between buyers and sellers has begun to narrow which should positively impact the level of sales going forward
1465886 the transaction was complicated by several factors not to mention the challenging economic environment but the buyer and seller worked through them in a highly professional manner
1465887 companies have developed excellent spending controls over everyday business trips but still have virtually no central control over the booking process for simple meetings
1465888 ums closes this gap by consolidating the booking of small company meetings into a single meeting planning function for the first time worktopia now provides the means to measure overall expenditures for simple business meetings ensure regulatory compliance enforce sound procurement practices and generate savings for discounts based on volumes with each supplier all within one single online workflow
1465889 worktopias new ums provides a practical solution in todays meetings environment
1465890 corporations continue to tighten their controls over spend and the smaller simple meetings are now more often under scrutiny as the need to maintain compliance across every level of business operations grows the value of services such as ums becomes extremely significant
1465891 im glad the governor has come around to saying publicly what weve known all along that we have to have taxes in order to correct the problems were in right now
1465892 ive told everybody dont plan to be there for the convention

1465897 sin oposici n no hay flujo de energ a no hay vitalidad la falta de oposici n conduce la vida a un estancamiento all donde tal falta se produzca
1465898 i believe that there are multiple considerations that will bias the fed toward leaving rates unchanged at least through the end of the year including but not limited to the positive impact on export activity associated with the weak dollar the need to encourage a positively sloped yield curve to assist recovery in the banking system and most importantly the need to impart stable interest rate expectations to business decision makers and consumers alike in an effort to foster confidence during a time of significant uncertainty
1465899 the fed is in a stuck spot right now it cant really cut rates without the threat of inflation and cant raise rates because it will put pressure on the financial system i think interest rates in general have faded as the center of policy as the fed takes on other issues
1465900 im to fast for you so dont bother touching me

1465914 por qu est n perturbados en verdad les digo todos los sacerdotes que se presentan en ese altar invocan mi nombre nuevamente les digo mi nombre ha sido escrito en este de la generaci n de las estrellas a trav s de las generaciones humanas y ellas han plantado rboles sin fruto en mi nombre de una manera vergonzosa
1465915 a esos que han visto recibiendo las ofrendas en el altar eso es lo que ustedes son
1465916 miren dios ha recibido su sacrificio de las manos de un sacerdote
1465917 dejen de sac rificar que ustedes han en el altar porque ellos est n sobre sus estrellas y sus ngeles y ya han llegado a su conclusi n aqu
1465918 rabb i qu clase de frutos produce esta generaci n
1465919 las almas de todas las generaciones humanas morir n cuando estas personas sin embargo hayan completado el tiempo del reino y el esp ritu las abandone sus cuerpos morir n pero sus almas estar n vivas y ser n llevadas a lo alto
1465920 y qu har n el resto de las generaciones humanas
1465921 es imposible plantar la semilla en la roca y cosechar sus frutos
1465922 maestro as como los has escuchado a todos ellos ahora esc chame a m tambi n porque he tenido una gran visi n
1465923 tu esp ritu decimotercero por qu te esfuerzas tanto pero habla y estar acompa ndote
1465924 en la visi n me vi a m mismo mientras los doce disc pulos me apedreaban y me persegu an duramente
1465925 ninguna persona que ha nacido mortal es digna de entrar a la casa que has visto pues ese lugar est reservado para los santos ni el sol ni la luna gobernar n ah ni el d a pero lo santo siempre morar ah en el reino eterno con los santos ngeles mira te he explicado los misterios del reino y te he ense ado sobre el error de las estrellas y enviarlo en los doce eones
1465926 maestro podr a ser que mi semilla est bajo el control de los que gobiernan
1465927 ven para que yo faltan dos renglones pero que tu te lamentar s mucho cuando veas al reino y toda su generaci n
1465928 cu l es el bien que yo he recibido pues tu me has apartado de todas las generaciones
1465929 tu te convertir s en el decimotercero y ser s maldecido por otras generaciones y tu llegar s a gobernar sobre ellos en los ltimos d as maldecir n tu ascendencia a la generaci n sagrada
1465930 ven para que te ense e sobre los secretos que ninguna persona ha visto jam s porque existe un reino grande y sin fronteras cuya extensi n no ha visto ninguna generaci n de ngeles y en el que hay un esp ritu grande e invisible
1465931 adamas estaba en la primera nube luminosa que ning n ngel ha visto entre todos aquellos llamados
1465932 los doce eones de las doce luminarias constituyen su padre con seis cielos para cada e n para que haya setenta y dos cielos para las setenta y dos luminarias y por cada una de ellas cinco firmamentos para un total de 350 firmamentos se les dio autoridad y despu s de eso tambi n esp ritus v rgenes para gloria y adoraci n de todos los eones y los cielos y sus firmamentos
1465933 la multitud de esos inmortales se llama cosmos es decir perdici n por el padre y las setenta y dos luminarias que est n con el auto generado y sus setenta y dos eones
1465934 que cada uno de ustedes y que generaci n falta un rengl n ngeles
1465935 vamos a crear a un ser humano a semejanza y a imagen
1465936 cu l es la extensa duraci n de tiempo que vivir el ser humano
1465937 por qu te preguntas sobre estas cosas que ad n con su generaci n ha vivido su plazo de vida en el sitio donde ha recibido su reino con longevidad con su gobernante
1465938 por eso dios orden a miguel dar los esp ritus a las personas como pr stamo para que ofrecieran servicio pero el grande orden a gabriel otorgar esp ritus a la gran generaci n que no tiene gobernante es decir el esp ritu y el alma por tanto el resto de las almas falta un rengl n
1465939 luz faltan cerca de los renglones alrededor que esp ritu que est dentro de ustedes mora en esta carne entre las generaciones de los ngeles pero dios hizo que el conocimiento fuera dado a ad n y a aquellos que estaban con l para que el rey del caos y el inframundo no lo rigieran sobre ellos
1465940 en verdad te digo por todos ellos las estrellas hacen que se completen las cosas cuando saklas complete el tiempo que se le ha asignado su primera estrella aparecer con las generaciones y terminar n lo que dijeron que har an entonces fornicar n en mi nombre y matar n a sus hijos y ellos y faltan alrededor de seis y medio renglones mi nombre y l su estrella sobre el decimotercer e n
1465941 no me estoy riendo de ustedes sino del error de las estrellas porque estas seis estrellas vagan entre estos cinco combatientes y ellas ser n destruidas junto con sus criaturas
1465942 en verdad te digo judas este bautismo mi nombre faltan cerca de nueve renglones a m en verdad te digo judas aquellos que ofrezcan sacrificios a saklas dios faltan tres renglones todo lo que es maligno pero tu exceder s a todos ellos porque tu sacrificar s al hombre que me reviste
1465943 en verdad tu ltimo llegado a ser faltan cerca de dos renglones y medio lamentan faltan cerca de dos renglones el que gobierna porque ste ser destruido y entonces la imagen de la gran generaci n de ad n ser exaltada porque antes que el cielo la tierra y los ngeles esa generaci n que es de los reinos eternos existe mira ya se te ha dicho todo levanta tus ojos y mira a la nube y a la luz dentro de ella y a las estrellas que la rodean la estrella que gu a a las otras es tu estrella

1466108 teaching design to youth is about unlocking a way of thinking design is no longer considered a superfluous subject but rather a process that can be applied to any problem in order to ensure an appropriate well informed solution creative problem solving has proven itself an invaluable skill for leaders in all fields the federal education law no child left behind has required schools to increase classroom hours spent on math and reading significantly often at the expense of other subjects including design
1466109 i argue that art and design education is for all students not just the talented few and it needs to be a core component of a students general education
1466110 studying art and design not only provides all students with the opportunity to develop their creative selves and to enhance their creative problem solving skills but through the study of art and design students come to understand that these disciplines are about the expression of ideas feeling and values
1466111 we empower kids to use design as a planning tool for success they break out of their passive roles and become active in the process of setting and achieving future goals in their education
1466112 but i dont think schools know how to talk about design my goal is not to create more graphic designers but to give kids different ways to enter the learning process
1466113 poll after poll among our youngsters has given statistical confirmation of the phenomenon of american life which david riesman in his book the lonely crowd named other direction extreme sensitivity to the opinions of others with a concomitant conformity as a nation we seem to have a syndrome characterized by atrophy of the will hypertrophy of the ego and dystrophy of the intellectual musculature this rather unpleasant portrait is an inescapable conclu ion from the mass of data on the attitudes of the younger generation more than half believe that the federal bureau of investigation and the local police should be allowed to use wiretapping at will that the police should be permitted to use the third degree that people who refuse to testify against themselves should be forced to do so

1466203 lo que vemos es que china ha progresado gradualmente de forma estable de cinco medallas en 1988 el n mero se elev a 16 en sidney y luego se duplic a 32 en atenas
1466204 si china mantiene ese ritmo es razonable pensar que ganar 39 medallas de oro en los juegos de pek n pero resulta que es el pa s anfitri n y los pa ses anfitriones en las competencias recientes han incrementado su r cord en 7 medallas
1466205 virtualmente en todas las escuelas los ni os son examinados para ver si tienen o no los atributos fisiol gicos que se requieren para convertirse en una atleta de lite

1466207 si lo que est s buscando es xito a cualquier precio entonces el modelo chino es el efectivo pero si quieres ser m s equilibrado en t rminos de qu es lo mejor para el atleta o qu es lo mejor para el deporte entonces el modelo presenta desventajas
1466208 es s lo un octavo de la inversi n china

1466216 diogenes was born around 412bc a contemporary of plato and spent his time railing against the materialistic society searching in vain with a lamp for an honest man he lived in a tub on the steps of the athenaeum and mostly ate onions
1466217 rather than a tub a lamp and a diet of onions ive got a wheelie bin a hooter and a diet of recycled jokes
1466218 i dont like clowns per se but i used to have a clown doll that sat on a chair next to the bed and it would talk to me at night at first it used to freak me out then it became my best friend
1466219 im not too sure i have much truck with the tears of a clown stuff everyone is a sad twat in their own way life is a pitiful existence isnt it i am happy when im in the middle of a joke thats when im happiest when i know ive got the punch line to look forward to but the punch line is never as good as the telling of it
1466220 i was parked up outside a kebab stall and there was a guy who came to talk to me for quite some time and then he just went round the back and he pushed the lid shut
1466221 i am what i am im a washed up clown but time was i could have wheelie bin somebody
1466222 luke wasnt moving fast enough so i jumped in there
1466223 so i start hitting oden but then he hits me back and you know how when you hit something and everything inside of you is shaking well thats what is happening here i hit him and then he hits me and everything is shaking
1466224 but he was like let me show you how to do it you are not doing it right and i was like coach let me do it
1466225 i yell and hit the floor and i couldnt get up
1466226 so they had to lift me up like a board and stand me up then i had to go from that position to trying to get in a car then i was wondering how i was going to fly back
1466227 ill shoot and i will do some drills but i wont play anymore even if i get my back right i wont play again not with him hes a big guy man a big guy
1466228 yeah i can see it and i think he will be special
1466229 and i want to help him understand what it takes because he has it in my mind he has it the physical makeup of him i mean to be 20 years old and have a body like that and to do the things he does i mean the power he has so i tell him that i want him to understand who he is and i want him to understand what he wants to be then like the nike commercial says just do it do it
1466230 when i worked out with him i hit hit and he hits right back and he hits back harder
1466231 i like that most guys you hit them and the next time they are kind of protecting themselves you hit him and the next time he runs right over you
1466232 he was trying to make a point by saying these are how the other guys are going to come at you and i was like ok well this is how im going to come back at them even stronger
1466233 coach is trying to make me better so you know what if he is going to sit there and push on me im not going to sit there and practice being soft im going to come back just as hard as i would in a real game

1466244 i would like this to go forward within one to 1 5 years at most two years
1466245 i think we are getting to where we need to be at the end of the day
1466246 at the end of the day there might be a little mixing and matching
1466247 i think were closing in on an agreement pretty quickly
1466248 im really more focused on getting off to the right start
1466249 the reality is there are things we can do immediately to get us to about 2 2 million square feet

1466261 i think back to when they started the modern olympics in athens in 1896 it was a beautiful idea to put people together again to make friendship and share the honor and share everything the ancient greeks stopped wars for the olympics they laid down their arms for the games right now war looks like a part of our life in this world but hopefully no wars no bombs no gunshots in those three weeks of the olympics maybe it is a dream it is my wish

1466265 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1466266 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1466267 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1466268 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1466269 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1466270 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1466271 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1466272 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous

1466278 coming from a company with a stellar reputation it was very important to align our office with a company that was just as dedicated to its clients and realtors
1466279 the entrepreneurial culture was another primary factor that drew our team to cherry creek mortgage
1466280 the union represents an opportunity for us to further strengthen the best retail mortgage platforms to better serve our clients and to enhance security and stability for our employees and customers
1466281 its fairly clear that this is being packaged as an extraordinary new kind of fund raising and the internet is a new and powerful part of it
1466282 but its also clear that many of the old donors are still there and important
1466283 this is about barack obama and changing the direction of our country

1466285 this is an important piece of the puzzle as we attempt to determine whether habitable conditions exist for microbes on mars
1466286 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1466287 this desert is a hyper arid environment that rarely sees rain and has no vascular plants and is often used by scientists as a matter of fact as a martian analog site
1466288 these compounds are quite stable in soil and water and do not destroy organic materials under normal circumstances in fact there are species of perchlorate producing microbes that live on the energy provided by this oxidant
1466289 unfortunately there was a story out that we were hiding something and of course as soon as that story goes out people speculate the speculation leads to all kinds of wonderful stories of discoveries that i wish wed made but we havent
1466290 we are committed to improving our financial results and believe these proactive steps are necessary to manage through the current challenging environment
1466291 we remain very bullish on our growth prospects as the market for natural and organic products continues to grow and our company continues to evolve

1466297 the circadian clock gene period is essential for maintaining a robust anti oxidative defense
1466298 in fruit flies the ability to deal with oxidative stress was very significant
1466299 that doesnt automatically tell us what the effects would be in humans but our ability to deal with oxidative stress is very important to our health
1466300 this could be a concern to people who routinely have disrupted sleep cycles such as swing shift workers people who work at night travelers crossing time zones
1466301 there has been what some call a clockwork explosion of interest in this field
1466302 these genes seem to influence or control so many different metabolic functions and disruption of those functions may have serious health implications
1466303 its about time i get whats owed to me from the situation i was stuck in
1466304 its unfortunate things have turned out the way they did but artists deserve to be compensated fairly by their labels for the work they do and that wasnt happenin in my case im happy to finally be a free man and make a new start

1466308 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects
1466309 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1466310 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
1466311 our model is proposing a way that the brain processes temporal information and how this can vary over time
1466312 positive excitatory feedback originating from recurrent connections between the cells
1466313 it seems like when youre in a more flexible brain state its easier for you to redirect your attention to new and important things
1466314 around 220 000 11 year olds are still failing to master at least one of the three basic subjects of reading writing and arithmetic tests results published today show the figures show the biggest problem is with writing where only 67 per cent of youngsters achieved the required grade a figure which has remained static for the past three years boys fare worse than girls with just 60 per cent achieving the required standard compared with 74 per cent of girls
1466315 some of the nations worst sex offenders will no longer be eligible to receive generous educational financial aid packages while they are confined in treatment centers under a bill approved by congress little noticed provision of a broader higher education bill makes such offenders ineligible for pell grants the nations premier financial aid program for low income students starting july 1 2009 both the senate and the house approved the bill late last week and president bush is expected to sign it into law
1466316 traffic growth is still quite fast so in some sense you could say yes were on the way to the exaflood or were already in it the issue is is this a reason for panic or action or throwing money at service providers so they could build out new links etc and the answer is no because this growth rate 50 per year can be accommodated with essentially the current level of capital investment we see more of a slowdown than a speed up
1466317 there is not a single sign of an unmanageable flood of traffic
1466318 if anything a slowdown is visible more than a speedup
1466319 there is no permission from the judge to treat this as a no knock warrant there is no affidavit of probable cause
1466320 the mayor demanded that they show him the warrant and they never did so
1466321 they bound me and forced me to kneel in the corner
1466322 my mother in law was bound on the kitchen floor they killed our dogs these dogs are loved throughout town
1466323 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1466324 se houver amea a de judicializa o das duas hidrel tricas dever do estado interferir para que n o dois cons rcios mas quase 200 milh es de habitantes n o sejam prejudicados
1466325 o cons rcio que ganhou santo ant nio que pretende impugnar jirau receberia tamb m como contrapartida a impugna o dele
1466326 vamos ter uma demanda judicial que n o sabemos em quanto tempo pode se resolver pode durar um ano dois anos dez anos enquanto isso ficariam essas duas hidrel tricas paralisadas quando n s precisamos que elas sejam iniciadas prontamente
1466327 people will be saying i thought it was this now youre telling me its this as well
1466328 if you dont leave the bar i will call cops
1466329 theres a pent up demand from people on the right side of the aisle who feel that the mainstream media is effusively covering barack obama and not critically covering him
1466330 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
1466331 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
1466332 fleeced how barack obama media mockery of terrorist threats liberals who want to kill talk radio the do nothing congress companies that help iran and washington lobbyists for foreign governments are scamming us and what to do about it
1466333 with book like these the minute some people know theyre out there they must have them
1466334 the anti obama readership is largely one that has already made up its mind and is looking for validation while the obama readership comprises both those who have already made up their minds and those who are curious about him
1466335 mccain doesnt have the same kind of resonance its nothing in comparison because you can still shape peoples view of obama but its way too late to shape their view of mccain
1466336 gets people excited about the idea of reading a book
1466337 books from both the left and the right often work this way
1466338 they begin at the grass roots they begin with a direct channel between the author and the consumer theyre not mitigated by rumors or secondary comments theyre a kind of vote the consumers cast for the authors point of view
1466339 why not just believe the doctrine because it is biblical
1466340 you just gave away the farm by citing nicaea you have effectively betrayed sola scriptura
1466341 because the conclusions reached at trent were a conciliar statement of the one true church

1466345 to mobilise resistance as the only option to liberate the country
1466346 i say to our enemies do not be happy for we are stronger today than any other time
1466347 we insist on continuing our struggle until full liberation of the countrys soil
1466348 the name of the tour comes from the term hucking which means to launch ourselves into the air
1466349 so youll see a lot of complicated choreography where there are five guys on a ramp at once all flying over and under each other and motorcycles flying overhead and also freestyle elements with each of us individually doing what we do best
1466350 weve learned a lot in terms of what works and what were capable of and we keep expanding on that
1466351 i feel like this year the stuff that weve created is much more intricate and much more complicated than what weve done in the past
1466352 you really do need to see the location in person its breathtaking
1466353 every politician every journalist every consumer of journalism should read mark learn and inwardly digest it
1466354 quite simply a must read this expose of scares of our time makes for a fascinating and eye opening study
1466355 in this well written and timely book lewis peace studies univ of bradford describes the islamic community in the uk including who they are where they live and what they believe using statistical information as well as individual narratives the author tells of a community united by islam but divided by ethnicity generation class and country of origin the british islamic community ranges from rich arab businesspersons living in exclusive london enclaves to poor immigrants from south asia living in highly concentrated communities in the west midlands areas with high unemployment the muslim community also has the youngest average age of any group in britain without work alienated from both their ethnic communities and the larger english society and distrustful of their parents generation some muslim youth are attracted to the radical anti western teachings of such groups as hizb ut tahrir or other radical salafi groups many of which advocate terrorist activities highly recommended
1466356 the expansion of state power has occurred in almost every crisis and at the expense of individual liberty in short war is a kind of petri dish for the germ of expanding state power

1466374 has just said he intends to convert to judaism before marrying his fiancee who is jewish and the heiress to the founders of darty
1466375 could be interpreted as drawing a link between conversion to judaism and social success
1466376 i am anti semitic and i am no longer afraid to say so i want every jew to live in fear except if they are pro palestinian let them die
1466377 charlie hebdo has dealt a terrible blow to freedom of expression by seeking to gag sine the libertarian
1466378 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1466379 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1466380 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1466381 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1466382 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1466383 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1466384 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1466385 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
1466386 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
1466387 their bodies wont be able to tolerate pregnancy and delivering children
1466388 the expansion of goscon to include an international open ict summit is a timely and highly welcome step in an effort to harness practical knowledge experiences and best practices of egovernment initiatives that have leveraged open icts
1466389 the international open ict summit couldnt come at a better time for professionals working in government and technology around the world
1466390 goscon provides a great opportunity to gain insight into how open technologies in government work and there is no friendlier place than portland for such a meeting
1466391 governments around the globe have been leading adopters of open technology some through practical application in their ict operations others through regional or national referendum
1466392 we are pleased to bring government executives together for an unprecedented exchange
1466393 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1466394 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded center contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1466395 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from m87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1466396 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of m87
1466397 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1466398 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1466399 in m87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1466400 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1466401 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1466402 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters center m87 sits at the center of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the center probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster

1466408 i dont know what it is nor do i think anyone else does contrary to the claims you hear asserted
1466409 although darwin gave us an essential component for the evolution of complexity it is not a sufficient theory
1466410 evolution on its own doesnt look like it can make the creative leaps that have occurred in the history of life
1466411 its a great process for refining tinkering and so on but self organisation is the process that is needed alongside natural selection before you get the kind of creative power that we see around us

1466435 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1466436 its not surprising when you know that fans began lining up early this morning outside of our office
1466437 we planned for them to go quickly but didnt expect to be out of tickets within 10 minutes of the windows opening a lot of people purchased them online which helped move them so quickly
1466438 if philip roth had gotten his way one scene cut from the film but present in the novel might have been notorious
1466439 roth wanted the blow job to be very graphic in the film he was probably trying to intimidate me i have no problem with blow jobs but people dont want to see penelope biting his penis

1466445 once we got in there and started to mess around we just didnt stop
1466446 we just didnt think it was very rock and roll it wasnt until we heard piano in a nickelback song that we all said yes we like this and we want to do more of it it just complimented the part so well and really showed that we shouldnt be narrow minded about any instrument no matter what it is or what sort of stigma might be attached to it
1466447 on the long road we went in a heavier direction but with this album we really wanted to show our range and have songs that work for all the diverse fans that go to nickelback shows and listen to our records
1466448 we are totally thrilled to have daniel in the band
1466449 the creativity that went on with him in the studio was really inspiring hes a totally amazing player
1466450 i wanted a real different flavor for that solo and billy totally nailed it
1466451 after he did the guitar part he actually sang the third verse on the song in that low gravelly voice of his and we put this distortion effect on it its really cool
1466452 after i put the song together i really wanted vinnies blessing
1466453 so i called him up and played the track for him over the phone he said id love to have you do a song about my brother vinnie then sent some guitar outtakes and we pieced together a solo and put it on the song the result is a new dimebag darrel solo
1466454 i really like to tell a story that comes off like a movie inside the listeners head
1466455 and i try to put myself in the scene when im writing it that makes it easier for me to look around and see what i can sing about otherwise you dont get any details and it doesnt play out very well
1466456 i think i just wanted to take a trip down memory lane and i wanted to see if i had enough ideas that would make other people take that trip too
1466457 its so funny throughout the course of a day how many times you look back and think
1466458 cada vez que llenas el dep sito las petroleras llenan sus bolsillos

1466462 ya ha cumplido la condena que le fue impuesta por los delitos que ha cometido
1466463 ya ha cumplido la condena que le fue impuesta por los delitos que ha cometido
1466464 todav a hemos visto estos d as al anterior ministro de justicia hablando de construir nuevas imputaciones para que de juana siguiera en la c rcel pero eso es hacer un flaco favor a la democracia y al estado de derecho
1466465 la democracia y el estado de derecho como m s se fortalecen es con la aplicaci n escrupulosa y rigurosa de la ley y de la normativa vigente en cada momento
1466466 si de juana sigue siendo un terrorista no arrepentido su lugar natural sigue siendo la c rcel
1466467 estamos haciendo m s publicidad y la publicidad fortalece a los movimientos terroristas
1466468 s lo pueden implantar el terror si se habla de ellos
1466469 el error que comete el estado de derecho con la reducci n de la condena y la excarcelaci n es que de juana est consiguiendo una segunda rentabilidad por sus m s de 20 asesinatos

1466483 the battle for wine and love or how i saved the world from parkerization
1466484 increasingly i find i have a very particular peculiar palate and point of view i often dont taste or see the world in the same way others do
1466485 i have a distinct preference for the traditional wines of western europe and a matching skepticism about most of the wines produced in the new world as well as for those wines made in the old world that seek to imitate the characteristics of their new world brethren
1466486 but begin to deflate as soon as they are opened like blow up dolls
1466487 you couldnt very well serve the most classic dishes from italy with these new wines
1466488 as the journalists were slapping high scores on the new wines i retreated to my older collection every time i drank an old barolo i was overwhelmed with remorse there was the italian in me why change such a perfect thing what could i do to make sure these guys who followed the old way these holdouts didnt disappear altogether
1466489 there were bad wines and great wines not right wines and wrong wines what you liked was in large part a question of taste a complex concept generally agreed upon to be a reflection of personal preference and part of tasting and understanding wine involved being open to the idea that some wine requires patience and work and is not instantly gratifying
1466490 it was supposed to be an old school option play to get the fans pumped up and everything i kind of messed it up i guess
1466491 i was just supposed to play the quarterback and i got up there and i guess he just didnt pitch it soon enough so i swatted at the ball and got a piece of it i dont know how happy the coaches are with me about it
1466492 he came out of it the no 1 buck linebacker hes a backup mike and i think hes going to be a good football player for us were really excited about him
1466493 coach pelini and his staff are holding everyone accountable for their actions on and off the field
1466494 which will result in a passionate and disciplined team this fall
1466495 i was interested in all sports growing up as a kid and just a very competitive guy from the get go
1466496 time management is a very important skill and you must make school and studying a very high priority be committed and consistent with your study skills and routine and the results will be positive
1466497 i remember them telling me that by earning good grades you will have unlimited options in the future i love to compete in the classroom and want to be the very best
1466498 it was neat to wrestle at the devaney center and to be recognized as the best in my grade level
1466499 i remember the tenacity and energy guys like jason peter and grant wistrom displayed on every play
1466500 i have tried to pattern my style and intensity after those guys
1466501 and enjoy giving back in any way that i can

1466507 an obnoxious laugh swearing like a sailor bad breath breaking wind getting blackout drunk talking about your exes its a long list
1466508 some guys really dig love handles your issues seem to be more about you than your boyfriend it sounds like you should hit the gym not for your body or your boyfriend but for your mind
1466509 i believe we all have a handful of soulmates the most important thing to me is someone who makes me laugh i know thats cheesy but really its not as complicated as you think
1466510 you cant please everyone as long as youre having fun in the meantime it will happen i try to get to know the girls im attracted to without having an official date i keep it light become their best friend and hold off on the romance if youre friends first the rest of it happens more naturally

1466537 a one or two point gain in fourth grade test scores here or there is not meaningful in the face of that overarching 21st century challenge whats needed is a wholesale transformation of the public school system from the broken down postwar model of the past 50 or 60 years
1466538 weve never taken that research fact seriously in our teacher policy weve done just the opposite
1466539 im sure you have so much to say so many stories to tell
1466540 oh that reminds me of the time that impostor came into our lives oh tell the one about that boy
1466541 there was another fight today there was hair and blood on my floor afterwards
1466542 a friend of mine works at a school where the most terrible things happen
1466543 i read a blog the other day that said the most depressing thing about inner city schools
1466544 1 na noite de ontem j depois do envio deste texto benfica e vit ria de guimar es jogaram para o tal trof u platini cuja conquista permitir a qualquer dos clubes minorar um pouco as frustra es desta pr poca marcada por resultados e exibi es que sobretudo no caso do benfica deixaram muito a desejar mas sobretudo pela amarga derrota das pretens es jur dicas na uefa para quem tenha visto o jogo em casa ou na televis o n o pode ter deixado de vir ao esp rito a ideia de que se tratava de uma esp cie de jogo de consola o entre dois emblemas que tudo tentaram para entrar pela porta do cavalo numa competi o onde se entra pelas provas dadas em campo mas o vit ria acabou por ter o favor dos deuses consigo depois de ter continuado a insistir at ao dia do sorteio e at que a uefa lhe dissesse para parar de mandar requerimentos acabou por ver o sorteio reservar lhe um modesto advers rio a sair da dupla ifk gotemburgo basileia melhor era imposs vel e se nem assim o vit ria conseguir franquear a porta da champions mais expostas e imperdo veis ficam as raz es que o levaram pouca digna batalha jur dica perdida na uefa j o benfica consumido pela eterna quest o do vem n o vem agora aplicada novela luis garcia bem precisa de um trofeuzinho para fazer companhia aos rivais sporting guadiana e fc porto braga e mais do que isso para sacudir a onda de descren a que a olho nu j se vai espalhando entre os seus adeptos e dar a quique flores aquilo de que ele mais precisa e que o luxo mais raro por aquelas bandas tempo tempo para fazer uma equipa e tempo para a p r a jogar frente na prepara o seguem claramente o sporting e o fc porto embora ambos tamb m condicionados pela novela de sinal contr rio vai n o vai pelo que se percebeu nenhum deles desdenharia vender quer veloso e moutinho quer quaresma o drama justamente que quando se mostra vontade e necessidade de vender o comprador baixa o pre o e faz chantagem e entre o desastre de vender mal ou a op o de n o vender e ficar com jogadores de m cara dif cil encontrar o ponto de equil brio mais dif cil ainda estar a formar as equipas e a afinar o modelo de jogo sem se saber se at 31 de agosto a equipa a que est ou est desfalcada de um ou dois jogadores preponderantes se me permitida uma opini o neste mercado de milh es acho bem mais complicado o fc porto substituir o quaresma do que o sporting passar sem o moutinho

infere das suas declara es ao corriere dello sport ele n o compreende como que mourinho ainda n o foi capaz de explicar aos dirigentes do inter que o quaresma um desequilibrador rar ssimo um talento que pode ainda ser bastante melhorado e que vale bem 40 milh es mas tamb m se percebeu dessas declara es que est ansioso por o vender o que nada me admira com dez aquisi es j feitas esta poca evidente que faltam milh es na casa a tal politica negocial dos portistas que eu sempre critiquei mas que parece n o conhecer outra alternativa l pelo drag o 2 quem me l noutro lado sabe que nunca tive grande respeito pelos pareceres dos mestres de direito alguns dos quais foram meus professores na faculdade dar pareceres um modo de ganhar a vida leg timo como outro qualquer mas de h muito que perdeu aquele aura de respeitabilidade que dantes tinha e pela simples raz o de que os mestres d o pareceres em tudo conforme aos interesses de quem lhos paga n o raro ali s encontrar sobre a mesma quest o dois pareceres radicalmente opostos assinados pelo mesmo mestre o parecer t o badalado do prof freitas do amaral vale por isso e para mim exactamente o que vale e que pouco vale o mesmo por exemplo que o parecer oral e gratuito que o prof marcelo rebelo de sousa deu sobre a mesma quest o na rtp onde freitas viu malfeitorias apenas do lado de uma fac o do conselho de justi a marcelo viu as sobretudo do lado oposto mas aparentemente e como aqui escreveu o rui moreira o parecer de freitas do amaral foi tido pela fpf como lei e senten a e acabou por ser ele parte decisiva da senten a que condenou o boavista segunda divis o e a prazo talvez mesmo extin o isso que ficar para a hist ria mas dentro de alguns anos talvez j mesmo agora quando algu m perguntar porque raz o foi o boavista despromovido segunda divis o ningu m lhe saber responder h de ter sido por um facto muito grave mas o qu ao certo comprou advers rios comprou rbitros n o est o em causa ali s tr s jogos dos quais o boavista empatou um e perdeu dois o que foi ent o coa o responder algu m mais entendido e com melhor mem ria mas o que isso de coa o pode ser tudo o que se quiser e o que n o se quiser no entendimento lato do cd da liga coa o pode ser por exemplo um dirigente de um clube passar pelo rbitro no intervalo de um jogo e dizer lhe veja l o que anda a fazer basta que o rbitro escreva isto no boletim do jogo e segundo o crit rio do cd estando os conselheiros para a virados o clube a que pertence o dirigente pode acabar despromovido eu nunca fui bola com o estilo valentim loureiro por raz es que est o vista de todos mas n o deixo de achar o c mulo da hipocrisia que aqueles que puseram o major na liga exactamente para poderem utilizar o seu poder de influ ncia e coa o venham depois condenar o boavista se calhar at assentar lhe um golpe mortal porque o major ou o filho fizeram aquilo que deles se esperava e quem nunca quis coagir um rbitro ou os dirigentes da liga quem nunca falou de arbitragens antes dos jogos quem nunca protagonizou cenas eventualmente conden veis nos t neis dos est dios que lance a primeira pedra que as coisas precisavam de ser moralizadas estamos todos de acordo que esta gera o e este estilo de dirigentes do futebol portugu s precisavam urgentemente de passar ao museu pac fico que se tenha escolhido exemplos l carte boavista e fc porto para encetar a dita moraliza o isso o que todos sabem tamb m que n o passa de uma hipocrisia e reflecte apenas o prolongamento para o terreno da mal chamada justi a das guerras clubisticas que se deveriam limitar ao terreno de jogo se o major combina o rbitro de um jogo com um presidente de um clube qualquer o major condenado por coa o se combina com o presidente do fc porto s o ambos condenados mas se combina com o presidente do benfica o processo mandado arquivar sem culpados bela justi a

1466553 nearly half of the recruiters who talked to our under cover students compared everyday risks here at home to being in iraq
1466554 you have a 10 times greater chance of dying out here on the roads than you do dying in iraq
1466555 some recruiters told our students if they enlisted there was little chance theyd go to war
1466556 face an increasingly reluctant pool of potential recruits opposition from anti war protesters and perennial bureaucratic inefficiency in the recruitment system
1466557 there are only two things we should fight for one is the defense of our homes and the other is the bill of rights war for any other reason is simply a racket
1466558 were an empire now and when we act we create our own reality
1466559 i served in all commissioned ranks from second lieutenant to major general and during that period i spent most of my time being a high class muscleman for big business for wall street and for the bankers in short i was a racketeer a gangster for capitalism
1466560 intervention overseas is not needed for security against other nation states and only leads to blowback from the one threat that is difficult to deter terrorism in short the u s empire lessens american prosperity power security and moral standing it also erodes the founding principles of the american constitution
1466561 community resistance to aggression as an alternative to military defense it is based on widespread protest persuasion noncooperation and intervention in order to oppose military aggression or political repression there have been numerous nonviolent actions to be sure some of them quite spectacular such as the czechoslovak resistance to the 1968 soviet invasion the toppling of the marcos dictatorship in the philippines in 1986 the palestinian intifada from 1987 to 1993 and the collapse of communist regimes in eastern europe in 1989
1466562 sal is a bright jrotc student who lacked support for success in school and beyond his father was deported to mexico about two years ago and he was told by the military recruiter that if sal enlisted his father could come back to the united states his father begged him to enlist after high school sal later learned that the military was lying and that he couldnt help his father come home
1466563 the activism around immigrant rights helped sal to see the hypocrisy of fighting in a military that is being sent to the border and has been reported to shoot down undocumented people who try to cross
1466564 during a rally sal took off his jrotc uniform in front of the press encouraging other students to resist war and drop out of jrotc unfortunately most wont because of concerns about their grades this student who is articulate and smart is failing school and lacks the support he needs i have mobilized help for him at the school and call him regularly he just got back from a peace camp given by our partner organization and that was a powerful experience for him

1466566 we believe aafia has been in custody ever since she disappeared
1466567 and were not willing to believe that the discovery of aafia in afghanistan is coincidence
1466568 there are many questions that the fbi and the pakistani government need to answer in light of this admission
1466569 aafia siddiqui is a woman who has been plagued by a number of problems in her life none of which have anything to do with involvement with al qaeda
1466570 whilst we welcome this disclosure reform the fbi it has only come after mounting international pressure and five years of detention and abuse siddiquis case represents the problem of disappearances in pakistan in the most tragic way the acceptance by the fbi that siddiqui has been in custody in afghanistan raises important questions which must be answered by the pakistani and us governments siddiqui must be returned to pakistan in order to faces charges for any crime she may have committed or released along with her children
1466571 were looking for uk ladies who have recently got married during some point this year who may want to come on the show and have their dresses trashed live on tv

1466602 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1466603 we have not yet read the report which has not been sent to us by the rwandan government we are therefore not in a position to react
1466604 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1466605 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1466606 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1466607 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1466608 so if you could go ahead and try to remember to do that from now on thatd be great

1466650 important parts of the evidence tendered against the defendants at the preliminary hearing and at trial have been found by the court to be unreliable likely false
1466651 i quite simply do not believe the evidence of the officers
1466652 when officer self interest and or the bond of the thin blue line is challenged as in a disciplinary proceeding overt lying is widely recognized as a common occurrence
1466653 police knowingly give false testimony to facilitate the prosecution and to ensure the conviction of persons the police know are guilty because police so easily get away with noble cause perjury police quite reasonably believe they are being encouraged to lie by the administration of justice itself
1466654 you would expect police witnesses to have a stronger regard for the oath but people lie in court all the time police officers included
1466655 there is an attitude that the legal system is just a bunch of bulls invented by lawyers and the oath doesnt really bind anyones conscience in some quarters im not saying every cop is like that but ive certainly had the impression over the years that there are many that do feel that way
1466656 theres a world of difference between saying im not satisfied sufficiently to deprive somebody of their liberty based on the evidence and the officers are outright liars
1466657 even when sufficient evidence exists and apparently only when a defence lawyer catches them lying and it makes the front page of the newspapers
1466658 i sent a package off to internal affairs nothing was ever done
1466659 no ones aggressively going after anyone and at the end of the day nothing happens
1466660 theres no apathy at all were very concerned about comments made by judges
1466661 we thoroughly looked into the entire matter and it was determined that there was no evidence to support either criminal or police services act charges
1466662 its only in the most clearest of cases when the evidence is there
1466663 success in the sciences unquestionably takes a lot of hard work sustained over many years
1466664 at least on the emotional level contemporary american education sides with the obstacles
1466665 the intellectual lassitude we breed in students their unearned and inflated self confidence undercuts both the self discipline and the intellectual modesty that is needed for the apprentice years in the sciences
1466666 the antiscience agenda is visible as early as kindergarten with its infantile versions of the diversity agenda and its early budding of self esteem lessons
1466667 beyond bias and barriers fulfilling the potential of women in academic science and engineering
1466668 a society that worries itself about which chromosomes scientists have isnt a society that takes science education seriously
1466669 when i saw my son lying on the ground i wanted to go to him to help him but i was thrown on the ground and handcuffed
1466670 i was a few inches away from comforting my son but i was prevented
1466671 we all loved him i know my son would never harm someone with authority
1466672 we just saw this past weekend a man carrying a knife in one hand and a head in the other hand and he is still alive today

1466678 with all of americas top polling companies to choose from knxv chose surveyusa
1466679 surveyusa is one of the most professionally run research companies in america
1466680 surveys play a vital role in understanding how we can better serve and communicate with our community
1466681 were able to build entire newscasts around the information we get from surveyusa
1466682 18 of survey usas final polls were the closest for that state almost twice as many as every other major poll put together
1466683 surveyusa has been more open and has provided better data than virtually all other survey houses whether conventional or automated calling
1466684 i have complete peace of mind when i pick up the phone to call surveyusa
1466685 they responded immediately and did a great job for us
1466686 i have been impressed by their professionalism and dedication to the science of public opinion
1466687 i saw a pirate and stood on his boot the pirate cut paper and punced a star star from the paper the pirate put a star on the chart the chart is for pee pee he got a blue star for poo poo he told his mommy he and no not pee pee just poo poo
1466688 i am poo pooing you stay right there dont come to me
1466689 if you limit your choices only to what seems possible or reasonable you disconnect yourself from what you truly want and all that is left is compromise
1466690 you are the person who has to decide whether youll do it or toss it aside you are the person who makes up your mind whether youll lead or will linger behind whether youll try for the goal thats afar or just be contented to stay where you are
1466691 the gazette issued a decisive statement denouncing this story as a hoax on october 17 1997
1466692 the group decided on the title funnel cloud as a metaphor for unexpected treasure and tragedy of living after experiencing one of natures little curve balls
1466693 the gazette issued a decisive statement denouncing this story as a hoax on october 17 1997
1466694 its a great ruling for the teachers and the state employees
1466695 it essentially says the government cant use the pension fund as a rainy day fund
1466696 instead of seeking a tax increase or cuts in other state programs that did not enjoy special constitutional protection defendants diverted the employer contributions to the retirement system
1466697 keeps retirement funds where they should be with retirees who have dedicated their careers to serving the public
1466698 i am proud of you for pee pee in potty
1466699 some people look for converts while others look for heretics
1466700 im gay and i tried to work against expectations of both the coming out story and the homoerotic story i ran in the opposite direction
1466701 the show is about two things what it is to be a man and how men think about women and theater the power of shakespeares play without costumes or props
1466702 this is a directors showcase and each production has made different choices you write it and let it go
1466703 four boys in a repressive environment who find freedom through this play
1466704 students 1 2 3 and 4 are characters outside of the shakespearean characters
1466705 its their story i get a buzz when i see what happens when you look at things through a different lens
1466706 it needs muscularity a pack of teenage boys generates an energy violence is always possible something happens with an all male environment there is a kind of mob mentality a different energy when there are no women around
1466707 forget about gender and sexuality its much more exciting if the characters are swept into something monumental and dangerous that was not in their minds to have the play itself push them to emotional abandon
1466708 my job as a director is to cast well and then to paraphrase british director richard eyre give the actors a comfortable loving environment and ask them to soar
1466709 what saddens me the most about our society is that for boys any behavior that shows intimacy is labeled and shamed dont cry dont be a sissy while girls are allowed to have best friends have sleepovers hold hands r amp j addresses that
1466710 a huge percentage of people have read romeo and juliet in high school and r amp j is a sexy story four good looking charismatic guys its a new way to enjoy a classic piece
1466711 there is no guarantee that they may return in good times our economic relations are based on trust and its very difficult to restore trust once it has been breached
1466712 we are not going to get involved in tit for tat with the americans
1466713 our mission there was to get the place and the people to a state where the iraqis could run the country if they chose to and we are very nearly there
1466714 our mission was not to make the place look somewhere green and peaceful because that was never going to be achievable in that timescale and in any case only the iraqis can fulfill that aspiration
1466715 that situation could arise if the situation gets worse in basra if and when the british leave now the situation has changed in the south it is considerably worse certainly with the kind of gangland warfare that is preying on the people in the south
1466716 the brits have never had enough troops to truly protect the population
1466717 those who make such statements are bothered by our visit to syria
1466718 we will pay no attention we care for our people and our constitution and can find friends elsewhere
1466719 its not up to the politicians in washington dc to say whether he will remain in his position
1466720 it is up to the iraqi people who now live in a democracy and not a dictatorship
1466721 whatever your position in that debate one unmistakable legacy of vietnam is that the price of americas withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like boat people re education camps and killing fields
1466722 no one has the right to place timetables on the iraq government it was elected by its people
1466723 russian czech consultations on the issue which were held four months ago regrettably brought no change in the czech position you made the decision to push ahead with the deployment of a radar on your soil i believe that would be a huge mistake by your leadership
1466724 we are being told that there is no need to conduct consultations now that the decision to deploy a missile defense system has been made and that russia is only interfering in the dialogue between the u s and poland and the u s and the czech republic it seems to me that this is wrong
1466725 we will continue talks and will not refuse to study the russian federations proposal on the joint of use its capabilities we will closely follow talks on the issue between russia and the u s
1466726 we believe that based on realistic assessments of threats from the south additional measures may be implemented on the deployment of additional missile defense elements in europe and we will stand firm on this position
1466727 china not the federal reserve controls us interest rates by its decision to purchase hold or dump us treasury bonds
1466728 washington does not have hegemony over chinese policy and if matters go from push to shove washington can expect financial turmoil
1466729 china has many markets and can afford to lose the us market easier than the us can afford to lose the american brand names on shelves that are made in china
1466730 china not the federal reserve controls us interest rates by its decision to purchase hold or dump us treasury bonds
1466731 washington does not have hegemony over chinese policy and if matters go from push to shove washington can expect financial turmoil
1466732 china has many markets and can afford to lose the us market easier than the us can afford to lose the american brand names on shelves that are made in china
1466733 now lets consider the cost to china of dumping dollars or treasuries compared to the cost that the us is trying to impose on china
1466734 consider that if china were to increase the value of the yuan by 30 percent the value of chinas dollar holdings would decline by 30 percent it would have the same effect on chinas pocketbook as dumping dollars and treasuries in the markets
1466735 by dumping dollars china expands its entry into other markets and accumulates more foreign currencies from trade surpluses
1466736 as is usually the case the harm we suffer is inflicted by washington
1466737 the chinese government has begun a concerted campaign of economic threats against the united states hinting that it may liquidate its vast holding of us treasuries if washington imposes trade sanctions to force a yuan revaluation
1466738 such action could trigger a dollar crash at a time when the us currency is already breaking down through historic support levels
1466739 beijing had the power to set off a dollar collapse if it chooses to do so
1466740 china steps up currency fight by absurd threat to sell us
1466741 a great deal to maintaining the position of the us dollar as an international currency
1466742 mr hes statements were an apparent response to the us senate finance committee which last month approved legislation aimed at pressing for faster appreciation of the yuan
1466743 several u s senators have renewed calls in recent weeks to punish beijing if it does not let the currency the yuan rise in value
1466744 the dollar continued its decline in global currency markets yesterday intensifying worries among some economists that mounting u s budget and trade deficits could send the u s currency into a tailspin
1466745 the decline rekindled the fears of some analysts that the dollar could be headed for a severe sell off
1466746 it would erode u s living standards below what they would be by making imported goods more expensive
1466747 an investment adviser halted withdrawals tuesday prompting unfounded fears that the credit crunch had started to touch money market funds but problems in the subprime mortgage market continue to take their toll on small lenders
1466748 the nymex metals market was the lone bright point friday gold recovered from its losses of a day earlier as investors rushed back to that traditional haven amid the uncertainty in other markets
1466749 once they got a glimpse of my expanding physique a few days ago they have been like a pack of coyotes circling their prey whilst eerily howling with delight
1466750 though ours is a mountainous county we nevertheless receive large numbers of visitors either sightseeing or seeking to invest every day anjis mountains waters and pure air are now valuable commodities

1466755 skopje kale is now in function of the existing restaurant there and the goal of effectuating the values it posses will be accomplished when the parking lot is full of tourist buses not only wedding ones
1466756 there is detailed evidence from the middle ages the ottoman period there are many written sources and photographs of the kale we should define the beginning of life in this area because archaeological evidence so far is much comprehensive the oldest records should date from the bronze age also this site offered settling opportunities in all the metal periods we have certain evidence dated from the iron ages and early antiquity from the early byzantine period there is no evidence on the roman age because skupi was the centre at the time and marble blocks were brought from there and embedded in the kale walls so far the walls are the main element where different constructing techniques and different material originating from different periods are recorded our task is to verify the periods with cultural layers
1466757 we need remains of the tangible culture to connect the walls i expect the fortress to be an area where a lot can be seen and learnt because the cultural values of the skopje area are here
1466758 over recent days members of a separatist group were arrested in khuzestan
1466759 they were arrested after a tip off from the public in searches of their hideout a substantial number of military weapons were found
1466760 the aim of this separatist group was to create division and also to propagate religious sectarian division
1466761 to right wingers willing to look beneath what probably sounds to them like the same identical views of the democratic candidates it is pretty clear that hillary clinton is the most conservative
1466762 no western soldier ever wakes up in the morning with the intention of harming any afghan citizen
1466763 if that does inadvertently happen it is deeply deeply regretted
1466764 defense officials said they believe at least 22 and possibly as many as 50 former guant namo detainees have returned to the battlefield to fight against the united states and its allies
1466765 greatest and most distinguished guest we have ever had in all times
1466766 regarding eugene robinsons june 12 op ed it was inevitable that somebody would sneer at the albanian reception of president bush robinson patronizingly writing of a wonderful reverse borat moment
1466767 the one duty we owe to history is to rewrite it
1466768 i understand that the bombing ended the war and i think that it couldnt be helped
1466769 i understand that if the united states had accepted japans peace overtures the war could have ended without the use of the atomic bomb
1466770 so really why are you unnecessary arguing with greece and bringing problems to your little country why dont you just change your name and solve this dispute in one blow
1466771 greece officially denied the use of the name macedonia after the balkan wars
1466772 todays greeks and ancient hellenes have no relation between them
1466773 and she was not there forever but after the cataclysm of defkalion which occurred in the hellenic area in fact in the ancient hellas which was around dodoni and it changed many times the flow of acheloos river in that area live the selloi and the ones that were once called graecoi and are now called hellenes
1466774 what gives greece the right to name another country this issue is straightforward every country has the right to call itself whatever it wishes
1466775 saints cyril and methdje or kirl and metodi were not greeks but macedonians
1466776 linguistic science has at its disposal a very limited quantity of macedonian words a very limited quantity in this case is a quantity indeed that greeks cannot ignore
1466777 if philip united and not conquered the greeks why did alexander leave 25 000 men of his army in macedonia when he is about to face the strongest and most numerous army in the world
1466778 if macedonians were greek then why only 30 of alexanders army were greek
1466779 ancient macedonians did not take part in the olympic games
1466780 there are no ancient monuments written in the macedonian language because greek archaeologists destroy them when they are recovered
1466781 this step should decrease tax evasion and stimulate taxpayers to meet their obligations to the state it would also encourage foreign investors to put their money in macedonian business knowing that taxes are low
1466782 in a global economy capital naturally flows to areas of least resistance which is why we are seeing such explosive growth in flat tax countries
1466783 it is ironic to witness the number of eastern european countries many of them former communist nations moving to tax simplification
1466784 they had some type of smoke or odor in the cabin
1466785 the captain elected to declare an emergency and get everybody out of the aircraft via the slides
1466786 and thus far found no evidence of an active fire
1466787 you hear from time to time about planes returning to airports because an indicator light went on but its pretty rare that they actually deploy chutes
1466788 thats essentially up to the pilot who makes the call based on the particular circumstance he or she faced
1466789 we indians will not and there has not been and i dont think in the near future we will see such a friend and supporter as this president absolutely there is none
1466790 to stop negotiations over the deal will only help china
1466791 the main beneficiaries of the deal getting delayed from a strategic point of view are china and pakistan in that order so whose interests are we protecting if the deal is delayed or scuttled it would allow the chinese to acquire unipolarity in asia countries like russia france and even japan would like india on board because its presence would provide a sense of equipoise to the equation in the asian strategic grid
1466792 the choice presented to india is stark and simple either india integrates itself with the global powers or it isolates itself to be dominated by china and perpetually countervailed by pakistan
1466793 india in as a tool for its global strategic pattern
1466794 indias dna doesnt allow itself to become an ally subordinate to the us like japan or britain
1466795 the latent mistrust of china which was well entrenched among the security agencies but of late was missing in the public perceptions and within the strategic community has now resurfaced at a popular level
1466796 so nothing happens by accident its not just symbolic its much much more but will we be able to get benefits out of all that without this nuclear agreement
1466797 all of this is inter linked we cannot insulate this people dont seem to realize that
1466798 hey ill keep this it could be good for the writing
1466799 shop who shall not be named a la voldemort in
1466800 thanks to you to your courage and hard work the forest fire at merlin city has been extinguished i wish to express to you my deepest gratitude and to present you with these medals

1466816 in the space of six months the flex has gone from mass market vehicle to niche product
1466817 we are in a desperate race against time in pursuit of prevention that works
1466818 weve known for some time that the expansion of coverage with haart antiretroviral therapy could help to reduce the number of new infections
1466819 however we were amazed at the actual number of new infections that can be potentially averted by expanding access to treatment
1466820 nurse anna robert keeps looking at me and sticking his tongue out
1466821 if you ignore him i bet he gets tired of doing that and then hell stop

1466824 hes still a little sick but i think hes starting to feel better if he keeps sticking his tongue out at you let me know and ill talk to him ok
1466825 he seems ok to me though maybe ya should just kick him out anyway

1466829 this sixth generation of golf cars will completely redefine the quality and comfort level of its class over broad categories offering more customer value than ever before
1466830 we have cast the golfs core components in a precise new mold
1466831 the golf is the global icon car making so the architecture and graphic form of new model are also absolutely clear and unique
1466832 it is more accentuated more three dimensional than its predecessor with precisely defined lines and edges and with finely proportioned flared surfaces and recesses
1466833 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation
1466834 rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts
1466835 serious injury to human beings in a manner that is especially heinous atrocious or cruel

1466838 ibms hpc open source stack results from long experience with keeping large scale computing systems running like clockwork
1466839 as more and more computing tasks migrate to supercomputer style clusters there is a need for software that can effectively utilize and manage the large number of processors found in these systems
1466840 managing thousands of processor cores and multiple types of processors is a challenge we see every day and it will only grow in the future
1466841 the ibm hpc stack and other items in the repository help open source supercomputer users and systems managers keep pace with the rapid advances in cluster computing they are in constant need of improved software components since the hardware advances so quickly

1466847 the president has made it clear that the united states government remains committed to a diplomatic solution with respect to iran
1466848 the israelis of course have gone bananas theyre very upset about the idea of not going if youre going into iran the israeli position is very firm they want us to go and they want us to hit hard
1466849 as an israeli told me if you run into a lion you either shoot it or ignore it you dont pluck out its eyebrows
1466850 the strategy calls for the use of sea launched cruise missiles and more precisely targeted ground attacks and bombing strikes including plans to destroy the most important revolutionary guard training camps supply depots and command and control facilities

1466854 the combination of suse linux enterprise server and lotus foundations represents a significant step forward in the simplification of this environment it provides an affordable reliable easy to use software appliance for small and medium businesses and opens new opportunities for business partners to simplify the development and deployment of software applications for those same companies were excited to further extend our close partnership with ibm and be selected as the first company to deliver solutions for this important initiative the next wave of software delivery is here
1466855 i was there from the beginning when ibm lotus domino was being considered for a nitix offering and provided input on the necessary steps to deploy applications into an integrated domino server i never envisioned it to become such a simple process with wizard drive interfaces
1466856 domino isvs are excited about this because it opens a new market opportunity them to sell domino applications to small businesses
1466857 because this is a software appliance these applications can be deployed into environments that may not have on site domino administrators suddenly the sky is the limit for domino developers
1466858 mid market businesses typically have lean it organizations which can limit their ability to migrate their applications as their needs grow
1466859 ibms linux based software appliances provide a fully integrated solution from the operating system to the application and everything in between for our business partners to deploy in each customers environment the software appliances reduce the complexity of deploying new applications by minimizing the installation and configuration process business partners can move into higher value services more quickly helping grow their revenue

1466861 the appliance solution reduces installation time for our customers from one to two days to only a few hours
1466862 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious cios coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc in every region provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
1466863 well work to unlock the desktop to save our customers money and give freedom of choice by offering this industry leading solution
1466864 ibm software and linux on desktop combined is not just a better price performance substitute for the microsoft offering but it provides a new platform for customers and business partners to add true value by creating tailor made solutions

1466870 we are excited about distributing lotus symphony from canonical online store
1466871 open collaboration client solution powered by ubuntu that includes lotus notes and symphony gives us the opportunity to deliver a complete microsoft desktop alternative to our customers we look forward to working with our hardware partners to expand their solution offerings
1466872 ibm has been a major supporter of linux and open source for ten years helping to drive the adoption of linux by millions of users across tens of thousands of devices and applications
1466873 linux is clearly main stream we look forward to the next ten years where linux will continue to increasingly drive business critical workloads for all sizes of organizations while empowering the new enterprise data center through virtualization real time linux cloud computing and other advances including liberating the desktop
1466874 with a worldwide 24 7 sap implementation downtime is not an option the new z vm release allows us to continue to add and grow our system without any outages
1466875 running z vm along with the ibm system z linux implementation of sap has allowed us to support our recently expanded company with little additional resources z vm 5 4 continues to allow us to manage very large servers and application functionality with a minimum of effort
1466876 experts often discover things that ordinary people have known for ages

1466887 i hope that you have noticed in the last three days of debate by the republicans up here that we have tried to be civil and appropriate i would ask you to compare that with the supposed democrat representative weve had here today and his rudeness and screaming and yelling
1466888 energy is clearly unambiguously the number one issue in the u s
1466889 wouldnt it be just great to work for myself and not for others
1466890 yeah youve got something there i havent seen anyone doing just this maybe bits and pieces of it but not in this combination it would be really great to be able to do just that
1466891 we have increased our forecast because there has already been a very active early tropical cyclone season in the deep tropics and more favorable hurricane enhancing sea surface temperature and sea level pressure patterns in the tropical atlantic have developed
1466892 we are in a desperate race against time in pursuit of prevention that works
1466893 weve known for some time that the expansion of coverage with haart antiretroviral therapy could help to reduce the number of new infections
1466894 however we were amazed at the actual number of new infections that can be potentially averted by expanding access to treatment
1466895 wtf i dont even have a desk and sleeping on a single bed and im paying this shit
1466896 what you get with us is a band that has ideas about what they want to do with funky soulful music in the next two years we want people to continue to be surprised by us thats why we havent even put out our best songs yet
1466897 i deserve what i get i take full responsibility for what i said
1466898 and from what ive heard the whole week is extremely long
1466899 youve got dinners every night not little dinners but huge massive dinners i know as players thats the last thing we want to do we want to prepare ourselves thats part of the whole thing youre just a slave that week
1466900 then my dad called and said he heard it on the golf channel
1466901 i guess they hammered me pretty good and it kind of erupted from there
1466902 it was a chance to enlighten him about the ryder cup and pga of america activities
1466903 we saw a talented young man who would like to play in the ryder cup and knew he had made a mistake and was looking to amend those mistakes i appreciated that
1466904 because they are not relevant to what the ryder cup is today
1466905 the crowd you could hear it a mile away we had to sit at one hole and wait for people to come through and it was just crazy you could see the energy on everybodys faces
1466906 from what ive heard the ryder cup just isnt fun
1466907 the fun is sucked right out of it thats the word i hear a lot
1466908 just from the presidents cup having such a good time it was disappointing to hear about the ryder cup that it wasnt as much fun i was disappointed to hear that about an event i had looked up to as a kid
1466909 we undertook a world class research effort to discover why that might have happened
1466910 they cant keep making golf courses longer because not every course has a 20 million budget
1466911 and they cant keep us from hitting the ball far because theres enough engineers and r amp d and technology that keeps us getting longer if you can limit the amount of spin on the ball and make the guy play from the fairway its probably a good avenue
1466912 i have no problem with that because i feel like its a challenging thing for a player to judge shots out of the first cut of rough or out of the rough
1466913 is the ball going to spin how is it going to come out
1466914 as we change the grooves were going to have to start maybe looking at the way our golf ball is performing
1466915 however i already know it moves the rule book backward
1466916 how does this help the average golfer enjoy the game more
1466917 we think were in good legal position in case a manufacturer does feel necessary to file a lawsuit
1466918 i need to try and find a bit more consistency for me to really feel like i can compete when the gun goes off
1466919 my game is kind of coming and going right now
1466920 ive been working on trying to get it a bit more consistent but last week was like a typical week for me at this point two really good rounds i thought i had something going and then kind of a so so round on sunday
1466921 i felt like i was gaining on something but then came out on sunday and sort of fell away a little bit again
1466922 thats been disappointing i would love to get to a point where the feelings dont come and go so much
1466923 being a left handed person playing right handed i have some tendencies that tend to work against me in my golf swing when im not playing well
1466924 at that point i start fighting those tendencies its just something that i have to deal with and its about inconsistency i dont think im going to try and read anything into it
1466925 im just going to go work harder at it and try and find something that sticks well see how it goes hopefully it comes together come thursday
1466926 i dont think that golf should be an olympic sport at all
1466927 i dont think basketball should be an olympic sport i dont think tennis should be an olympic sport i think if i was running the olympics now this is just simply if i was the guy running it i would go back to the way it was originally gymnastics weightlifting swimming track and field marathons thats to me what the olympics is
1466928 the olympics is not about tennis or golf or anything like that in my opinion those are like in basketball
1466929 youve got three sports there that are like guys are getting paid a lot of money to play and compete week in and week out playing those sports and its just so professional and to me thats not what the olympics is about
1466930 to me the olympics was founded on amateur sports guys go in there and train for four years and putting their whole lives on the line to win a gold medal
1466931 having golf as an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1466932 it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundations and all those revenues and that would all be going towards the growth of the game of golf
1466933 every country wants to be represented properly in the olympics
1466934 the olympics brings us to new markets on a worldwide scale and i cant imagine how big the game would become in countries like china and india that has so many more people that the united states does if it became a priority for those countries to partake successfully in the olympics and put the revenue in towards growing the game there just about everybody would win
1466935 i havent really looked into the thought of playing in the olympic games to be honest
1466936 its never been its never been in the olympics so i really havent paid any attention to it at all at the minute
1466937 i think having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1466938 it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going towards the growth of the game of golf
1466939 the majors are incredibly big as we know but we still capture the same audience that are already interested in the game
1466940 the olympics brings us to new markets on a worldwide scale and i cant imagine how big the game can become in countries like china and india that has so many more people than the united states does
1466941 the first opportunity for it to be an olympic sport would be 2016
1466942 our tv contracts and sponsor contracts typically end in 2012
1466943 there would be plenty of time to factor that into the equation its only once every four years its not a big disruption by any means
1466944 i dont think that golf should be an olympic sport at all
1466945 i dont think basketball should be an olympic sport i dont think tennis should be an olympic sport
1466946 if i was running the olympics i would go back to the way it was originally gymnastics weight lifting swimming track and field marathons
1466947 pat dont you think the west is being much more vocal through brainwashing media techniques automatically enforcing respect for neo con ideas

1466954 creemos que el anuncio es excepcional y transmite el mensaje de secret obsession
1466955 the reality is we will have a new president in three months and what bush and the republicans are trying to do amounts to a land grab for the oil companies
1466956 i dont think we have to give in at all pre election we have many more options postelection
1466957 my view is that if we have a vote lets make it a rational policy
1466958 we cant let republicans hold this issue hostage because of one vote
1466959 the current debate seems to be bogged down in partisan one upmanship
1466960 its grossly unfair to the democrats who want a vote
1466961 this is a not a new issue this just didnt happen today weve been working on this for months
1466962 there is no crisis on our side of the aisle
1466963 we have a plan and we will stick to it
1466964 you never can push them as far as they can go
1466965 the reality of the peak performance of the console is yes you could look to a generation beyond where we are now and think yeah i could use that power
1466966 but the reality is in 360 and the ps3 and the latest generation pc graphics the amount of power in the gpus is such that youre more bound by your creativity and the aesthetic youre going for than youre really bound by polygon pushing power
1466967 youre probably actually more bound maybe by art authoring and the amount of data throughput that just the amount of memory youd need but i dont think 360 has reached its limit
1466968 i cant believe how much support theyve given this game
1466969 will it completely stop them from coming across of course not
1466970 rest assured there will eventually be holes in parts of the wall made by people trying to get in but it buys us valuable time
1466971 the great wall of china did not stop the mongols and the berlin wall didnt stop people escaping to freedom why do they think this will be any different
1466972 is a political initiative meant to satisfy conservatives in congress who have played to fears about all immigrants being terrorists criminals and living off the dole
1466973 we have no idea to what extent we can enforce our own laws
1466974 the consequences of an open border are smuggling of drugs and human beings into this country
1466975 intensified and mixed anti immigrant racist views with a law enforcement only approach towards immigration
1466976 the main immigration flow has not stopped coming it just shifted
1466977 in other words the same number or more people are crossing the border
1466978 the wall is symptomatic of the fact that the us is not responsive to a rational immigration policy

1466989 i wonder if a few years in the wilderness wouldnt be good for the republicans
1466990 im going to say id vote for him so i dont appear racist but in reality i wont vote for him
1466991 obama has been flopping around like a lip hooked bass
1466992 so because a second poll says the same thing as the first they can both be ignored
1466993 if the superdelegates suddenly shift over and pick clinton to be the nominee the democratic party will melt down

1467075 there is a lot of power involved in golf but more so feel and touch
1467076 i dont know if somebody took steroids how that would affect the game i dont think golf is that much a power sport as it is in other sports like athletics or things like that where there is such a small margin between the athletes
1467077 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1467078 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1467079 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1467080 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1467081 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1467082 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1467083 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1467084 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1467085 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1467086 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1467175 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1467176 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1467177 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1467178 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1467179 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1467180 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1467181 though the mere fact that a cause of action is dismissed upon a rule 12 b 6 motion does not automatically entitle the moving party to have sanctions imposed
1467182 the fact that ward had filed forty two other lawsuits in the past six years at least one of which was identical to the one before the court was undoubtedly a factor in the affirmance
1467183 the statute provides jurisdiction to the wake county superior court upon application by the secretary of revenue

1467185 my globe colleague todd wallack was the first to raise questions about patricks claim that his 1 billion life sciences initiative which stalled last year in the legislature could produce 250 000 jobs in a decade that wallack reported would be twice as many jobs as the state added from all sources over the past decade the life sciences sector currently employs 60 000 to 75 000 people in massachusetts
1467186 the more i think about it the less certain i am that we can fix this top down
1467187 state and local governments over the last five years have committed to spending an estimated 115 million to 235 million on 386 public employees who were allowed to invoke an obscure part of a state law to win earlier and significantly larger pensions a globe analysis has found
1467188 so not only will there be no effort to lift the overall cap on charters the administration may even impose a freeze that wouldnt otherwise be there in some districts consider the irony as administration officials tell it the readiness school effort is patricks attempt to apply the lessons of charter schools autonomy innovation choice responsiveness and a longer school day among others to the states traditional public schools and yet patrick is currently punting on expanding the very model that has produced those lessons

1467193 it looks like they spent three months and two weeks reviewing the one page letter i sent them rather than conducting their own investigation

1467195 the idea of microsoft free personal computing has been in the air for a while
1467196 were just partnering with linux distribution vendors and hardware vendors to make it happen
1467197 our role is more on evangelizing and providing the necessary software for corporate needs
1467198 i think the need for alternatives to the microsoft dominated personal computing environment are there
1467199 were viewing this as an alternative to the microsoft small business server group of products
1467200 rather than talk about virtualization technology for an appliance were talking about something that is simple and has a small footprint
1467201 a lot of it shops lack the experience to quickly deploy a linux based cluster
1467202 by making this software stack available were trying to make cluster deployment faster
1467203 one of the new features is that it allows you to build custom servers
1467204 so users will only have the components that are necessary for running their particular application and this adds tremendously to the agility and flexibility of the system
1467205 there are also additional server monitoring tools included and overall deployment and system management has been streamlined
1467206 one of the things that really characterizes web 2 0 is the high interactivity between the user and other users as well as the application in sharing information
1467207 these little microapplications like google gadgets are ideal for that on the other hand if someone creates a gadget that is designed to trick the user thats easy to do
1467208 todays decision by the federal communications commission will go down in history as one of the most important milestones in the fight for an open accessible internet
1467209 the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago
1467210 we cant progress in evaluating options without an order to review
1467211 although we dont think the fcc action will have much material effect on comcast the order does set a precedent that will likely reverberate politically and legally
1467212 the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions
1467213 to have this event on the mainstage at ozzfest in dallas is such a treat and an honor
1467214 when this tragedy originally happened i saw the music community come together like ive never seen before to have the name dimebag still to this day unite musicians to pay homage in such a respectful way is very overwhelming in dimes vision its always been about a damn good time
1467215 when we decided on dallas as the site for this years ozzfest it seemed like the perfect opportunity to pay tribute to dimebag darrell since it was his hometown
1467216 dimebag was a part of our ozzfest family and everyone in the metal community misses him dearly
1467217 to keep company with the guru is not only to be in his physical presence as this is sometimes impossible but mainly means to keep him in our hearts and to be one with him in principle and to attune ourselves with him to keep company therefore with the godlike object is to associate him with sraddha the hearts love intensified in the sense above explained by keeping his appearance and attributes fully in mind and by reflecting on the same and affectionately following his instructions lamblike by so doing when man becomes able to conceive the sublime status of his divine brothers he may be fortunate in remaining in their company and in securing help from any one of them whom he may choose as his spiritual preceptor thus to resume virya or moral courage can be obtained by the culture of sraddha that is by devoting ones natural love to his preceptor by being always in his company in the internal sense already explained and by following with affection his holy instructions as they are freely and spontaneously given

1467220 were excited to learn about everything now available to powerset in the live search stack were also excited to share the cool things weve cooked up here at powerset and start planning opportunities for us to integrate with live search
1467221 when the guy said that i had a snake or something underneath my truck i thought it was a rope or maybe a garden snake or something
1467222 i didnt want to touch it or let it go free over there near lakes community high school in lake villa so i called police
1467223 we had to get it out so we scared it as best we could and it slithered out
1467224 we think it was either abandoned or escaped from a home near where fiocchi lives in antioch
1467225 its a very docile snake it never tried to bite any of the officers or anything
1467226 but if not then well find a good home for it its healthy a little old but healthy nonetheless
1467227 the federal government is recognizing important properties that should be preserved
1467228 the hope is it is preserved and is important to the community but there are no restrictions
1467229 that opens that up to possibilities of grants and gets other peoples attention
1467230 that would give us all the working drawings for the renovation
1467231 the first thing people who give out grants want to see are your plans
1467232 they tried to go the civil court route but when the escrow still wasnt returned she took it to our criminal investigation division

1467236 the number one priority for all levels of government should be the safety of our citizens
1467237 surely the commission is able to see that they have a duty to place the health and safety of the people of texas over the perceived and hypothetical risks to the population of fish in a two acre area
1467238 we want to give the commission every opportunity to do the right thing on their own and i have faith that they will find a solution before session begins
1467239 but it is not acceptable to have the commission impeding the progress of a federal program of this level of importance the people of texas deserve and demand much better from their government
1467240 i dont know that that would be grounds for a mistrial
1467241 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1467242 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1467243 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1467244 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1467245 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1467246 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1467247 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1467248 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
1467249 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
1467250 their bodies wont be able to tolerate pregnancy and delivering children
1467251 with the help of the united nations we reached a new phrasing for article 24 which was agreed by the kurds and accepted by some of the other mps

1467257 i believe that there are a lot of athletes in the secondary that can take the ball away sack the quarterback and hit
1467258 its great that people are starting to look at us but were still trying to go out there every day and work hard to better ourselves
1467259 we have to earn it its not going to be handed to us

1467274 i couldnt say what it will be that i will be doing but it will be more adult drama i have three ideas and one day i will just pick one of them i am very lucky absolutely
1467275 you cant keep relying on your laurels you have to keep pushing it
1467276 there are all these sorts of ideas running around in my head funnily enough i have a book coming out about it i emailed a journalist every night telling him what happened that day to try and find the shape of my brain i guess i am quite interested in that myself
1467277 some companies have tried and its the same problem the music industry is going through now
1467278 we are heading towards a pattern where television shows are released worldwide to try and combat that problem
1467279 at the same time though i dont want to be critical of the internet a lot of people download
1467280 its an issue of quality but its something we have to keep and eye on
1467281 no i dont have any control over that sort of thing i just hope they heed our wise words and act on it
1467282 it is just turning this into a sci fi convention
1467283 as the days got long there was always one thing that would brighten my day seeing the american flag

1467285 i understand this is your birthday weve come to celebrate
1467286 how much different will things be for iraq as a result of today

1467288 while the vast majority of respondents said board certification is important to them most didnt understand the meaning of board certification
1467289 sixty percent incorrectly believe that a doctor has to be board certified to practice medicine and only 45 percent of survey respondents had ever checked to see if their doctor is board certified board certification is actually a voluntary process a doctor undertakes to demonstrate a commitment to lifelong learning and proficiency in his or her medical specialty
1467290 communication skills are increasingly recognized as an essential component of quality healthcare and not something thats nice but not necessary
1467291 these survey findings confirm that patients are demanding that their doctors treat them not just with medicines and procedures but with empathy and information that they understand

1467298 in former days the heretic was proud of not being a heretic
1467299 the man was proud of being orthodox was proud of being right
1467300 he was more than a man he was a church
1467301 the word heresy not only means no longer being wrong it practically means being clear headed and courageous the word orthodoxy not only no longer means being right it practically means being wrong

1467307 were doing shows soon as long as sonia stays with us well be dignified and well regarded
1467308 i just play the violin and dont turn up to rehearsals
1467309 i really enjoyed writing his character warren was a nice slice of levity in an otherwise fairly sad book and so it was always refreshing to write him into scenes
1467310 it soon became apparent that warren was becoming a cult figure and was certainly more famous than i was
1467311 i also had the opportunity to develop his character through the perth festival where warrens delusions of grandeur and status as a statesman were carved in stone
1467312 from there it seemed a natural progression to give warren his own pictorial forum to elaborate on his greatness and thus the idea of the illustrated story was born
1467313 after i saw sonias portfolio i barely gave a fleeting glance to the rest of the pile
1467314 it was above and beyond really at that moment i knew she was utterly perfect for the project
1467315 i was looking for someone who was art rich and bold and interesting because the last thing i wanted was a bland watercolour volume
1467316 but it was never just her astounding talent on the page sonia has wonderful instincts a great eye for detail and a wonderful sense of humour all of which are just as important as ability with a brush
1467317 we seemed to be on a very similar wavelength with similar aesthetic thoughts for the book which made communicating my visual ideas really easy and which made this project so much fun to do
1467318 it was fantastic to be offered something so quirky and cool as one of my first real projects
1467319 craigs unwavering enthusiasm and confidence in the project in the face of all my insecurities was incredible motivation
1467320 childrens book illustration had been a distant dream kind of career for me for a while so i feel very blessed to have been given the opportunity to break into it so relatively easily without having to go through all the years of rejection that seems to be the prerequisite
1467321 the direction of the book was developed over the course of many discussions over many cups of coffee along with a five page email from craig with a panel by panel break down of his ideas for every page of the book which frightened me enormously
1467322 he was envisioning a lot of things that were physically impossible to record on a two dimensional piece of paper it involved a bit of polite explanation as to some of the limits of my talent and the picture book genre in general
1467323 i wanted to stay true to rhubarb but not in a way that was distracting or alienating to the people that hadnt read it
1467324 also we struggled with just how far to anthropomorphise the character given that a lot of what makes warren funny is his dogginess
1467325 but i think we struck it okay it was never intended to be an easy linear story
1467326 it was warrens chance to set the record straight after the character assassination he endured in rhubarb though of course hes again undercut by the subplot
1467327 i dont know why i enjoy thwarting him so much
1467328 people are raving about sonia to the degree where i have to calmly remind them that im the famous one
1467329 before we released the book some folks were worried about how children would go connecting the dots back to rhubarb but that hasnt been a problem at all
1467330 that was never our intention anyway obviously we never expected them to predict the plot of the novel from some scant hints in the picture book
1467331 mostly we wanted kids to borrow these characters and apply them to the themes because we thought they would be compelling and interesting enough to make them think
1467332 we really thought hard about the detail and richness to keep drawing them back to the text to keep inviting them into the conversation
1467333 i always thought warren would be an interesting character for children particularly since he resents them so much
1467334 and i always thought he would be fun to present visually and so it seemed to make so much sense to do a picture book
1467335 through the perth festival i was fortunate enough to have my little book translated for children by storyteller glenn swift and when i happened by one of the performances i was completely astounded by how captivated the kids were and how much they loved warren in particular
1467336 i think it was then that i thought it might be a worthwhile enterprise that we might really pull it off
1467337 the most enjoyable part was using different styles and genres of visual representation to reflect the size of warrens ego where he is the star of his own movie posters comic books and newspaper headlines
1467338 i used the silentina film motif to help link all these fairly disparate styles together visually
1467339 if i can make it at all financially viable but otherwise ill be working in general illustration and graphic design
1467340 im told there will be further adventures of warren im just waiting on craig to hurry up with his next novel which he is so selfishly intent on finishing
1467341 ill hopefully have it finished editing by the end of the year after which ill be moving straight on to the next warren feature
1467342 which will be set at the lassie fraude uber stern ministry of guide doggery so itll be a prequel
1467343 his official line is that hes too busy and important to enjoy the accolades but i actually think most of warrens days are spent indulging his self satisfaction
1467344 particularly since hes going to be heavily involved with the association for the blind in the coming months

1467362 we hebben ons gebaseerd op de bedragen in het buitenland
1467363 na overleg met de profliga zijn we overgegaan tot de verhoging van de vergoeding
1467364 per maand zijn dit al flinke bedragen we kunnen de refs nu nog moeilijk amateurs noemen onze beoordelingen zullen dan ook behoorlijk wat strenger worden
1467365 zowel qua fysiek techniek en prestaties kunnen we nu meer van de scheidsrechters verlangen dat recht hebben we nu
1467366 tom boonen verdient ook meer geld dan johan vansummeren en in europa worden de matchen uit de champions league ook beter vergoed dan die in de intertoto
1467367 het is ook een extra motivatie voor de refs beter presteren betekent interessantere matchen n meer geld
1467368 de opslagvan de refs die niet internationaal fluiten is trouwens ook niet slecht
1467369 ook voor deze bedragen hebben we naar het buitenland gekeken daarnaast heb ik me gebaseerd op de gemiddelde loonsverhoging van de refs
1467370 er zullen nog wel fouten gemaakt worden maar we kunnen de refs stilaan profs noemen zo zullen de spelers automatisch meer respect tonen
1467371 een goede scheidsrechter is het minste wat we kunnen vragen
1467372 we willen dat de refs beter gaan presteren maar we moeten ook ons zegje kunnen doen de evaluatie mag niet enkel in de scheidsrechterscommissie gebeuren
1467373 onze vertegenwoordiger zal onafhankelijk zijn en we zullen zeker volwassen blijven
1467374 voorts is het logisch dat de refs opslag krijgen ze zijn sleutelfiguren maar waren te lang amateurs
1467375 de profliga heeft een grote inspanning geleverd de clubs zien het nut in van een goede professionele arbitrage en zullen de lat nu hoger leggen dat mag ook na een foutje zal er nu snel geroepen worden dat we er ondanks onze loonsverhoging nog niets van bakken maar ik kan dat wel hebben met vier clubs die degraderen krijgen we straks de moeilijkste competitie in 10 jaar

1467402 china has dramatically tightened security in tibet and announced new anti terror plans in order to prevent any possible embarrassment to the ruling communist party before a worldwide audience during the olympics
1467403 the more than 1 000 tibetans whose status following the spring demonstrations in tibet is unknown
1467404 i dont think its dawned on people yet but i think it will be most welcome and probably have some economic stimulative effect
1467405 theres not much we can do to lower the taxes at the county or the state level but this deduction is a useful way i think to relieve this burden
1467406 with property taxes shooting through the roof and incomes failing to keep pace new york homeowners need help to ensure that the affordable and middle class housing that is our bedrock doesnt become a bygone dream
1467407 were at spring levels and people are underestimating the strength of the current
1467408 its statewide its dangerous because of the slippery conditions and strength of the current
1467409 if they had gone another 25 or 30 yards i dont know what would have happened
1467410 we are looking for a clear positive response from iran and in the absence of that were going to have no choice but to pursue further measures against them
1467411 this is a major message to america and america is listening
1467412 while a very small band of your colleagues remain on the house floor to discuss gas prices their constituents deserve to know why their representatives in congress have failed to support serious responsible proposals
1467413 its really unfortunate that congress left for yet another recess without dealing with pending nominations especially for key officials dealing with energy issues like our nominee for deputy secretary of energy and three nominees to be commissioners of the cftc commodity futures trading commission
1467414 it is important for this great country to open itself to the gospel
1467415 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1467416 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1467417 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1467418 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1467419 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1467420 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1467421 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1467422 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1467423 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1467424 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1467425 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1467426 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1467427 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1467428 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1467429 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1467430 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1467431 the last thing i lined up for was et when it came out
1467432 if it pulls them in and theyre tweaked by it and it gets them interested then its good for stratford its good for the rsc and its good for shakespeare
1467433 only royal shakespeare company or production related memorabilia will be signed
1467434 your job is to try and see it as a play just another play to take each scene as it comes and play it as truthfully and as energetically as you can
1467435 i bought mine at christmas for 14 pounds 29 each
1467436 its blatantly discriminatory to single out people with hiv its stupid and ridiculous
1467437 these restrictions are really impeding our ability to control hiv and aids
1467438 i told him no because i thought it was stupid and discriminatory
1467439 its been humiliating to constantly be classified as a criminal
1467440 i think its great that america has finally seen the light
1467441 this is huge not only for the people who have not been able to enter the u s but finally these laws might be overturned throughout the world
1467442 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1467443 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1467444 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1467445 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1467446 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1467447 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1467448 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1467449 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
1467450 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
1467451 their bodies wont be able to tolerate pregnancy and delivering children
1467452 anybody who says we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1467453 todays announcement includes many of the policies ive been fighting for during my time in the senate and over the course of this campaign
1467454 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
1467455 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio workers makes in a year
1467456 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1467457 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1467458 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1467459 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1467460 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1467461 t boone pickens is about as conservative a guy as there is thats a serious republican oil man driller he says we cant drill our way out of the problem i think he knows more about it than john mccain
1467462 strongly encouraged by sen obamas speech on americas energy future foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk
1467463 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1467464 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties

1467468 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1467469 such mutual clarification can pave the way for a speedy and transparent negotiating process with bright prospect
1467470 it is more of the same from the iranians obfuscation and delays
1467471 it was not the type of response the international community was looking for
1467472 the letter handed over is not an answer to the offered package the letter does not mention the freeze for freeze issue
1467473 during the call jalili expressed his readiness to start formal talks
1467474 they have a very weak economy at this point which depends almost entirely on their oil revenue
1467475 say there will be a response but that clarification is needed on certain points of the offer
1467476 mr solana will discuss it with representatives of the five plus one
1467477 what could we possible learn from a character like that
1467478 none is righteous no not one no one understands no one seeks for god all have turned aside together they have become worthless no one does good not even one
1467479 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1467480 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1467481 race played absolutely no roll in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1467482 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1467483 im upset because my reporter was singled out for whatever reason that bothers me were just trying to figure out what that reason was

1467520 comecei bem perdi poucos pontos e abri um placar bom no segundo set
1467521 tive chances de fechar em todos os games que perdi me apavorei um pouco mas tive tranq ilidade para fechar acho que foi uma boa estr ia
1467522 no terceiro set acho que o andr sentiu algo e come ou a entregar mais os pontos ele come ou bem mas ganhei os tr s primeiros games
1467523 tive bastante dificuldade no come o mas prevaleceu minha vontade de querer ganhar mais e isso est me ajudando em quase todos os jogos

1467527 we know it will take time to get rid of these bad elements and even some good people joined them because they fell into a trap
1467528 if the government fails to deliver on basic services and other needs of the iraqis sadr followers could use their new organization to tell people they should look to them as voice of change
1467529 we welcome any news about iraqis laying down their arms and working to rebuild this country
1467530 we will continue to fight until the occupation is driven out of iraq
1467531 we want people to come back to the sadr movement and believe in us again
1467532 we hope this new direction will allow us to rebuild our relationship with the people and make them believe we are good again

1467557 o baque mesmo foi no jap o quando ele pediu para sair
1467558 right now i walk three to four miles a day at the mall and when the weather is nice i walk outdoors i go to the bellingham senior center a couple days a week and play pinochle and pool once in a while
1467559 i dont particularly like gardening or cooking because i have cooked all my life so i go out a lot
1467560 we really never saved for retirement my husband was a builder and we lived from paycheck to paycheck
1467561 we didnt really have any retirement programs i did work at a nursing home with matching funds ira and so i did enroll in that then when we lived in san diego we got by on our social security checks we had our house paid for
1467562 it is enough but it is not a lot in other words i still have to watch my spending and spend wisely fortunately i have always been in very good health so i dont have a lot of medical expenses
1467563 usually i think about it a long time before i make the choice for example i would love to get a powered sun deck that is retractable but it is something i would like but cant afford right now so that is something i have to put on hold
1467564 ever since we were married i have kept track of our spending
1467565 i have a box of all of our old ledgers i have a total record of all our spending and i keep it current all the time it is fun to look back at 1949 and see what things cost back then
1467566 bills and then necessities like gas i have been checking into bus routes because if gas gets higher im going to park the car and take the bus and whatever is left over have fun with
1467567 i dont do finances on the computer it works better for me to do it by hand i have worked with the office program quicken but i dont use it personally
1467568 i have never thought of saving for retirement i dont have a retirement plan in the senior center there are more than me that live day to day without much in retirement i live on what i get for social security
1467569 they are in different circumstances but i suggest they look into preparing now for retirement my oldest son is 53 and my youngest is 33 i have nine children
1467570 i have moved into an apartment for senior citizens and you pay according to what you have coming in so my rent is much less than if i went through a normal commercial renting process
1467571 i really dont splurge too often but probably at christmas for christmas gifts for my 23 grandchildren and 19 great grandchildren
1467572 i do want to put away and get a good computer so i just save for it i dont plan to put anything on payments
1467573 i keep record in a check book and have a little notebook i keep it in
1467574 i put down totals for food and rent and electricity and be sure i never go over what comes in
1467575 i pray about it and i consider what it will cost and how much it will mean to me not just now but in the long run
1467576 i think it would and that is one reason i want a computer
1467577 another good thing about the senior center is they have a class about learning to use the computer
1467578 i think the first thing is get with a good church and good friends so that you wont spend money on things that dont matter
1467579 think about what you are doing and count the cost rather than just buying what you want at the moment i think if people have a plan they get much more out of their money
1467580 i think credit cards are a real problem they are good at certain times but they are used too freely and cause problems for young people
1467581 they really should prepare and save for the future even if they dont make much and even if it is hard put a little away and invest in bonds or savings put a little away each month i hadnt done that and i wish i had if you start young youll be better off when youre older
1467582 i had to go to work very early and along the way i have had very good bosses who have helped me be aware of taking care and how to do bookkeeping
1467583 im a person different from most because i truly believe money isnt anything
1467584 im very active in church work and im a born again christian i do pray about my finances
1467585 i keep busy and i dont have time to sit around and put money on a pedestal i have everything i need
1467586 by increasing our college football lineup to 23 games across four conferences and adding a college football studio show the network is solidifying its position as a destination for college football fans
1467587 we saw tremendous growth last year from our college football package and with our increasing coverage this year we anticipate the positive growth trend will continue
1467588 washington is the most beautiful state ive lived in with the best climate
1467589 i grew up during the great depression so i remember very well black friday and people jumping out of windows and things
1467590 they were very frugal people and yet we enjoyed a nice lifestyle
1467591 we grew up knowing we didnt spend all we had and knowing you always put away for a rainy day so for years we lived like that
1467592 im not a big spender on clothing not a big shopper when i was working i didnt buy new clothes i took care of them and i recycled them i think you have to program savings into your daily life
1467593 i guess you could say my husband splurged on cars we had a new car every year the one thing i splurged on is my children
1467594 the willows is a very nice place to live it allows me to live independently and that is a luxury to me to not have to depend on my daughter
1467595 well i dont think we decided it was a matter of have tos have to pay rent buy groceries pay insurance over the years we just knew what it would take you list your expenses and live so you can pay those
1467596 i do it all the old fashioned way i do the paperwork all by hand and take care of all of my own expenses i give the stuff for income taxes to an accountant eventually i will retire from that and give it all to an accountant
1467597 they are far too extravagant they have to have a cell phone and an ipod whatever that is and all these other things they dont plan for disasters or anything like that i dont think most have a pattern of savings and most spend beyond their means that is the best thing they can learn spend within their means and save a little
1467598 money certainly isnt everything but it can cause a lot of problems if you dont have it there again it is about the lifestyle of what you earn
1467599 its never too late to save and the years go by so fast
1467600 but i think we she and her late husband should have saved and planned more and thats the best advice i can give we lived pretty much paycheck to paycheck it wasnt always easy
1467601 when terry and i started out together mom helped us a lot
1467602 we learned to be pretty frugal at the start and now thats helping us without being aware of it i think you just absorb those life lessons
1467603 not factoring inflation into retirement planning is one of the big mistakes people make
1467604 over the last 20 years health care has increased at about 7 percent annually for example so people need to plan for long range inflation
1467605 the mix varies according to the individuals risk tolerance time horizon and what you need to do to achieve your goals
1467606 diversity in investing is very important you dont want to have everything invested in one type of stock or in one company
1467607 i really think its never ever too late to save
1467608 theres always something you can do ten percent is reasonable if youre young although it may need to be more like 20 percent if youre in your 50s and you have little or no savings all other things being equal pay yourself first and look for ways you can save make saving a priority
1467609 we were both raised on dairy farms here in whatcom county during the depression
1467610 what we learned to do was share barter and exchange goods and services with other people everything was traded including labor thats how we got along
1467611 before we were married we discussed finances along with everything else
1467612 make sure you share the same values with your spouse or at least discuss everything
1467613 had we not had those policies we would have had to pay a lot more additional money for living expenses
1467614 either too much or too little insurance although most people are under insured when were talking about disability long term care and life insurance
1467615 what i would stress is the importance of getting a good financial adviser one who doesnt take all your profits
1467616 start buying good quality stocks and one or maybe two long term care insurance policies
1467617 what i really like to do is get people thinking about options they may not have really thought about getting them to realize the potential in the assets they do have and getting them to understand the clock is ticking
1467618 is keeping too much money in low interest accounts there are good safe investment vehicles such as certain bonds that can bring more income my goal is to maximize retirement income potential
1467619 i have no real regrets although i do wish i had saved more
1467620 i would advise anyone to try to save 10 percent of your income if you can i wouldnt be here if we hadnt a certain percentage of whatever you earn should be put away and i also recommend paying down your mortgage
1467621 we kind of lived one day to the next although we never lived high on the hog i did a lot of canning and we butchered a lot of our own meat we werent wasteful we were just plain ol farmers
1467622 i managed the money when my husband was working as a carpenter and we were raising our family
1467623 we paid cash and you really learned to stretch that dollar hard
1467624 i had a huge garden and we grew our own vegetables and fruits i canned everything you just learned how to be frugal in those days we were poor during the depression but you know what with all that we didnt know we were poor
1467625 my only advice is to learn to live frugally which young people wont always do because times are so different today i just want to tell younger people that they need to prepare themselves financially
1467626 but you know i wish i had started saving when my brother in law and sister in law did but its never too late i invested 7 500 eight years ago and now its 12 000
1467627 we bought a home in california in 1969 for 18 000 and we sold it in 1989 for 194 000
1467628 now its worth 750 000 so you never know but i dont regret any of that i love it here and i really love helping all the seniors at the senior center life is good

1467633 this is jeff haas your host for this hour of music exploring the art form of jazz and its connection to classic rock r amp b blues folk and more
1467634 my dads philosophy was lets make this music accessible to anyone and everyone
1467635 my goal and its a lofty one is to sort of extend that vibe of accessibility engaging people on an emotional level with great music
1467636 most people dont commonly associate jazz with other types of music but in reality all popular music in this country comes from jazz
1467637 at first i was wondering if i might be boxing myself in maybe i would run out of connections in a year or so
1467638 but the possibilities are really endless someone was influenced by someone else or covered one of their tunes or shared the same mentors so many different avenues to explore
1467639 the music engages people opens hearts and minds on a level that you couldnt effectively do through words
1467640 im sure there will be some hard core classical music listeners who wont be interested in jeffs show but most of our audience came of age listening to the beatles and elvis and abba and mancini in the 60s and 70s my guess is theyll have a more inclusive attitude than their parents did about what makes great music
1467641 i bring my own musical biases to the table and the opportunity to produce this show has helped me address them
1467642 its really about the challenge of keeping an open mind
1467643 the nation will have to decide as to which kind of islam it wants the world says that pakistan is extremist we will have to prove that we are not so when i say this im dubbed as an american stooge
1467644 we have to decide whether we want a liberal and moderate pakistan or a terrorist or extremist pakistan
1467645 how will you characterise the isis involvement in the opium smuggling business on the afghanistan pakistan border over the past six years
1467646 so the pakistan intelligence service had substantial involvement in the opium business along the pakistan afghanistan border over the last six years
1467647 i think there is a blurred line between t v reality and documentary there is a great common ground in which they sit the telling of real time story and such
1467648 he who tells history must tell it for all and not for himself
1467649 confusion and powerlessness all exacerbated by advertisers unceasing exhortation to happiness drive speakers to a frenzy of easy blame confession and exculpation
1467650 to mock the hapless in the name of raising important social issues
1467651 will not impact tvas operations or net cash flow from operating activities
1467652 the restatements involve accounting estimates that have no impact on tvas cash position or its ability to meet obligations to creditors customers investors or other stakeholders

1467655 mom i can read it on my own later maybe it looks like it sucks mom
1467656 i dont care its one of the most famous best books ever written and youre going to listen to it
1467657 you cant make a kid sit and listen his mother read a book to him mom there has to be some law against that thats like some form of abuse i think
1467658 i dont care call the police tell them im abusing your ears by making you listen to tom sawyer but do it after i read the first few chapters
1467659 here this chapter two is one of the most famous things in all of american literature
1467660 wow ive read chapter two hundreds of times can i go now
1467661 fairly oddparents is just like this this was written in the 1800s this is the loooongstanding precedent
1467662 fairly oddparents had an episode where they popped tom sawyer out of the book and cosmo traded his wand to help paint the fence
1467663 and do you know why they popped tom sawyer onto farily oddparents because its one of the most famous and best books ever written
1467664 ok well thats enough for tonight you guys can go off and do what you want

1467679 in some respects the bush administration is simply following a familiar path by responding to real dangers with illegal and deplorable methods
1467680 israel displayed an excellent ear and fine false turn of phrase during the 15 or so months in the early 1990s when she sold hundreds of phony celebrity letters and a lot of filched real ones to about 30 different dealers now all these years later shes written a slender sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures if i were a librarian i wouldnt let lee israel through the door but id certainly make sure i had her latest book on the shelves if i were an editor id sign her up to write a biography of louise brooks and not just to keep her out of trouble
1467681 the effect of this book on me was to make me like ammon shea and briefly to hate english what a choking god awful mash it is surely french is better then i recovered and saw its greatness afresh the o e d shea notes is a catalog of the foibles of the human condition shea has walked the wildwood of our gnarled ancient speech and returned singing incomprehensible sounds in a language that turns out to be our own
1467682 doris lessing once declared that fiction makes a better job of the truth than straightforward reminiscence and while that might well be true of her celebrated and semi autobiographical martha quest novels its an observation that doesnt apply at all to her latest book alfred amp emily an intriguing work that is half fiction half memoir the sketchy insubstantial first half of the book imagines what her parents lives might have been like if world war i had never occurred the potent and harrowing second half recounts the real life story of her parents and the incalculable ways in which the war fractured their dreams and psyches and left them stranded in the bush in africa eking out a meager existence on a tiny farm in rhodesia
1467683 brenda wineapple brings a scholars diligence and a novelists imagination to her account of dickinson and higginsons relationship crafting a tour de force that should delight specialists and casual readers alike the books individual strands of inquiry higginsons life dickinsons poems the letters that passed between them and the historical political and artistic contexts of the age are interesting in and of themselves but when intertwined so as to inform and strengthen each other theyre fascinating
1467684 a good and happy child is so well done that part of me wishes i had missed it i like to sleep soundly at night
1467685 this sly and discombobulating flight of whimsy by david deans is in a sense a book length joke and nothing drains the humor from a good joke as effectively as vivisecting it has comenius hallucinated his transformation and if so where did he acquire his knowledge of kafka and rilke of orpheus and lady macbeth is bob a good guy after all is he even out of town let alone in mexico and where is miss scarlett anyway mr deans may or may not provide the answers to these queries but the readers irresistible desire to know is evidence that hes pulled off a splendid joke
1467686 despite its specific american flavors travel writing seems most like a contemporary french novel such as those by christian oster and gregoire bouillier a book in which an atmosphere of established and almost enviable dailiness underwrites sophisticated narrative conceits truth matters less than the telling and that makes for a cool easy kind of fiction its not hemingway or borges or even dashiell hammett but its nice
1467687 have i raved enough i feel as if im barrys publicist or agent maybe shell give me a cut of the 2 million but i did love this book it didnt matter if i was in a bad mood or tired or had other things to do i wanted to read this book i wanted to be living in these characters minds hanging out in salem or on yellow dog island does the novel deserve the hype i certainly dont begrudge it
1467688 the now forgotten us immigrants to the soviet union in the early thirties were communist sympathisers or more often desperate victims of the depression at first they were feted waves of repression however ensured that they and their descendants ended up either in russias prisons or as inmates of the gulag this is a powerful important and highly readable book the gulag is no novelty but tzouliadis brilliantly links high politics to the torment of innocents adding devastating detail
1467689 the process of government can be annoying in its obsessive repetition of its main theme in its lack of interest in empirical evidence and yet its one of those rare books which change the way you look at the world
1467690 it would be difficult to find any precedent in american history for the scale brutality and illegality of the torture and degradation inflicted on detainees over the last six years
1467691 it would be even harder to imagine a set of policies more likely to increase the dangers facing the united states and the world

1467728 how is the doctrine of mary as mediatrix of all grace because of her mediation for us in heaven explicitly or implicitly contained in scripture
1467729 we never said it was its not a defined dogma there were a bunch people in the late 50s who wanted that mediatrix business universal mediatrix of grace business defined as a dogma it was never done a sufficient number of theologians thought that that coud not be found even imlicity implicitly implicitly in scripture

1467736 in doing a not so serious thing fantasy wrestling that we take seriously weve been able to establish ourselves as a serious brand and weve worked hard to establish that brand with our tremendous audience and support from that audience this is the next logical step giving back to the legends that have supported us during our development and who continue to support us as we continue to grow
1467737 we could have a stable outcome in which all countries converge on consumption rates considerably below

1467745 fundamental source of conflict all the major religions of the world give a very high status to man all the world religions teach that there is only one ultimate reality which we call god all of the world religions make absolute claims to truth war unrest and disharmony are loathed by all the religions
1467746 human beings have to face certain common problems in the world and because people of different religions share certain common feelings ideas and sentiments therefore there are bound to be certain similarities
1467747 there will be no peace among the peoples of the world without peace among the world religions
1467748 religions are in many ways similar and yet they are so different there is much which unites them but also much which divides them this is indeed irritating all the world religions teach that there is only one ultimate reality which we call god if that is so there can logically be only one truth but if there is only one truth why are there so many religions
1467749 this claim to exclusivity and superiority in which ones own religion is regarded as a priority better than others easily slips into fanaticism
1467750 no aggressor would in future be allowed to go unpunished

1467756 saya sudah mengkaji dengan sangat teliti agama agama terdulu dan agama modern dewasa ini kesimpulannya adalah bahwa islam agama langit yang yang benar kitab suci ini mencakup kebutuhan materi dan immateri bagi manusia agama ini membentuk akhlak yang baik dan menjaga rohani agar tetap sehat
1467757 apa yang dipaparkan al quran tentang realitas dan fenomena alam yang sempurna menurut saya adalah di antara kelebihan dan keistimewaan kitab ini yang jelas semua temuan dan ilmu pengatahuan yang didokumentasikan dewasa ini tidak mampu menandingi al quran
1467758 kesejahteraan dan kepemimpinan menjauh dari umat islam dikarenakan mereka tidak mau mengikuti petunjuk al quran dan mengamalkan hukum dan undang undang nya padahal sebelumnya sejarah telah mencatat bahwa generasi awal islam meraih kejayaan kemenangan dan kebesaran mmusuh musuh islam tau rahasia ini sehingga mereka menyerang dari sisi ini ya kondisi kehidupan umat islam sekarang ini suram karena tidak pedulinya umat ini terhadap kitabnya bukan karena ada kekurangan dalam al quran atau islam secara umum yang obyektif adalah tidak benar menganggat sisi negatif dengan menghakimi ajaran islam yang suci
1467759 wahai manusia kajilah al quran secara mendalam sampai kalian menemukan hakekat kebenarannya karena setiap ilmu pengetahuan dan seni budaya yang pernah dicapai oleh bangsa arab pondasinya adalah al quran hendaknya setiap penduduk dunia dari beragam warna dan bahasa mau melihat secara obyektif kondisi dunia zaman awal mengkaji lembaran lembaran ilmu pengetahuan dan penemuan sebelum islam maka kalian akan tahu bahwa ilmu pengetahuan dan penemuan tidak pernah sampai pada penduduk bumi kecuali setelah ditemukan dan disebarluaskan oleh kaum muslimin yang mereka eksplorasi dari al quran ia laksana lautan pengetahuan yang mengalir di jutaan anak sungai al quran tetap hidup dan setiap orang mampu meneguk sejuknya sesuai dengan kesungguhan dan kemampuannya
1467760 kami yakin jika disodorkan al quran dan injil kepada seseorang yang tidak beragama pasti orang tersebut akan memilih yang pertama karena al quran mengetengahkan pemikiran yang cocok dengan akal sehat boleh jadi tidak ada undang undang yang lebih detail tentang masalah perceraian kecuali undang undang dan hukum yang telah di gariskan al quran tentang masalah ini
1467761 al quran adalah kitab mendunia yang memiliki keistimewaan sastra yang tinggi yang terjemahnya saja tidak bisa mewakili tingginya sastra aslinya karena lagunya berirama khusus keindahannya mengagumkan dan pengaruhnya yang luar bisa terhadap yang mendengarkan banyak kaum nashrani arab yang terpengaruh gaya bahasa dan sastranya begitu juga kaum orientalis banyak di antara mereka yang menerima al quran ketika dibacakan al quran kami orang orang nashrani terpengaruh laksana sihir yang menembus jiwa kami kami merasakan ungakapnnya yang indah hukumnya yang orisinil keistimewaan seperti ini yang menjadikan seseorang merasa terpuaskan dan bahwa al quran tidak mungkin ada yang mampu menandinginya
1467762 tidak akan mampu seseorang sepanjang empat belas abad yang lalu sejak diturunkannya al quran sampai sekarang ini yang mampu membuat seperti ayat al quran satu ayat sekalipun karena al quran bukan kitab yang dikhususkan untuk zaman tertentu bahkan al quran ini alami yang akan terus berlangusng sepanjang zaman meskipun dunia dan kehidupan ini berubah namun setiap manusia memungkinkan menjadikan al quran sebagai pedoman hidupnya mengapa al quran lebih unggul dan menjadi pedoman hidup manusia sepanjang masa karena al quran mencakup hal hal yang kecil maupun urusan yang besar tidak ada sesuatu yang tidak diatur oleh al quran saya yakin bahwa al quran mampu mempengaruhi orang barat dengan syarat al quran dibacakan dengan bahasa aslinya karena terjemahnya tidak mampu memberi pengaruh kejiwaan dan rohani berbeda dengan bacaan aslinya yang menggetarkan jiwa meluluhkan qalbu

1467766 on july 28 2008 in a floor debate i challenged majority leader reid directly to keep the senate in session during august for that purpose he declined responding that republicans would suffer more than democrats because more republican senate seats were in jeopardy i countered with the observation that it wasnt a matter of whether republicans or democrats would suffer the most but that the issue was the suffering of the american people from the high cost of oil and gasoline
1467767 for months the senate has been dysfunctional and gridlocked for reasons specified in my op ed article copy enclosed which is published in the philadelphia inquirer today i further suggest that you call upon senator reid to suspend his practice of filling the tree at least during the august session so that the senate can perform its traditional function and legislate

1467829 this is a stunning development for which we should all be grateful
1467830 that even as we keep working globally we need to do much more to fight aids at home and i intend to do so with my foundation

1467833 the challenges are huge but i have no doubt that we will live in a world without hiv some day

1467842 we found that there was no difference between the circumcised men and uncircumcised men that there is no increase in sexual dysfunction in circumcised men and in fact circumcised men did report greater penile sensitivity after circumcision
1467843 this is a call to action to call for male circumcision its been two years and still there is not enough money focus to scale up effort and more needs to be done
1467844 there is no national male circumcision campaign to promote it more education is needed

1467846 when the predominance of the disease within the gay community led to a homophobic backlash

1467867 in fact the nma owes its very existence in part to these inequities which forced african american physicians to found their own membership organization

1467897 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1467898 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1467899 typically when we have child labor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
1467900 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law

1467904 therefore i am grateful that this was brought to the attention of the proper authority and my hope would be that some sanctions would be taken because i do think that these young children were not treated with respect and they should not have been there in the first place

1467924 civil partnerships proper inheritance rights and equality in adoption rights from gay couples
1467925 theres no credible evidence that children of lesbian and gay parents grow up in any developmental way physical intellectual or social thats different from other children
1467926 and given that three million children of heterosexuals are growing up in this country in single parent households it is odd that lord tebbits attention isnt turned to them
1467927 where lesbian and gay parents are adopting theyre often bringing up severely disabled children
1467928 those selfless parents should be being lionised not demonised by lord tebbit
1467929 the concerns being expressed this evening are primarily about sodomy rather than about sexual orientation that is doing not being
1467930 is it not possible for such a person to hold the view that it is wrong for the state to compel him to refrain from arguing that sodomy is a social ill or to conscript him or his children into aiding and abetting it if that is the right expression
1467931 a childs life prospects are better if it grows up in a family with a father and a mother than if it lacks either of them in general these are indisputable facts

1467940 a number of commercial firms compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products

1468010 het is de situatie waarbij van iedere honderd mannen er dertig tot veertig in de leeftijd zitten van 15 tot 29 jaar die leeftijdscategorie wordt allerwegen beschouwd als de beste vechtleeftijd op individueel niveau staat de jeugdballon voor de situatie waarbij een vader minstens drie zonen heeft en omdat hij maar n van die drie zonen een maatschappelijke positie kan bezorgen moet de rest vechten om een plekje onder de zon zolang ze nog een jongetje zijn is dat geen probleem dan worden ze nog wel aardig gevonden maar zodra ze volwassen zijn worden ze geacht uit huis te vertrekken
1468011 in mindere mate zelfs als ze niet trouwen kunnen ze binnenshuis een positie bekleden misschien geen hoge maar wel een waardige een zoon wordt absoluut nooit de ongetrouwde kinderloze oom die nog ergens in huis woont uitgesloten hij moet weg en dus zal hij moeten knokken voor een maatschappelijke positie maar hij zal al snel ontdekken dat die voor hem niet bestaan en dan kiezen ze drie oplossingen de eerste is vertrekken de tweede optie is criminaliteit zuid afrika en brazili zijn daar voorbeelden van ze hebben dodencijfers die lijken op een land dat met zichzelf in oorlog is dat zijn bijna zonder uitzondering geweldsmisdaden die jonge mannen begaan tegen elkaar en de derde optie is oorlog
1468012 if we only make standard fare we cannot beat other studios there were already adult videos with lolitas or themes of incest so we wanted to make something new a relationship between wife and an old father in law has enough twist to create an atmosphere of mystery and captivate viewers hearts
1468013 i think that as a subject there is this something that only an older generation has and the young people do not possess it is because they lived that much more we should respect them and learn from them
1468014 its easier for them to relate to older men and daughters in law series so they tend to watch adult videos with older people in them
1468015 people of my age generally have shame so they are very hesitant to show their private parts
1468016 but i am proud of myself doing something they cannot
1468017 that doesnt mean that i can tell them about my old age pensioner job
1468018 adult videos with young actresses sell well only in the first three months after the release
1468019 on the other hand mature women films enjoy a steady long term popularity which after 10 years or so might lead to a best seller
1468020 i think that in the future we will see a steady increase in demand
1468021 enough we know the game now and it is enough
1468022 here is our mission vision and values statement work with these as you serve our customers
1468023 a clear and detailed specification for the task and composition of a pastoral forum
1468024 those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
1468025 at least i got them to all talk to each other
1468026 such interventions often imply that nothing within a province no provision made or pastoral care offered can be recognizably and adequately christian and this is a claim not lightly to be made by any christian community regarding any other without grave breach of charity
1468027 internal pastoral and liturgical care strengthened by arrangements like the suggested communion partners initiative in the usa and the proposed pastoral forum
1468028 the way we should go if we want to avoid further ecclesial confusion
1468029 yep the bible says it and judging by what we saw we can certainly see why

1468043 ill repeat my instructions for the benefit of our guests
1468044 if either of them makes any sudden moves shoot them
1468045 that selfish niitas reputation precedes mine blasphemy to the very least however the answer is no i am jessica chin quite different from the foolish woman you speak of
1468046 i work ed with niita though that is how you say an ordeal in progress
1468047 and you must be referring to your brethen surely you did not assume we were oblivious to the two contacts you sent into the city hmm unlike the foolish woman i can assure you i know exactly whats progressed within the few hours theyve been there
1468048 they are dead dr niita personally dispatched herself to do so it seems your contacts have riled her up quite a bit enough for her to bring the insane twin sister into the fray hmm
1468049 and youll never have a chance to tell anyone about the pleasure of our acquaintance im afraid
1468050 you people have held me up long enough im tired of this game so i believe that im going to have your nice young woman kill you

1468056 theres enough of my strain of my creation in those tanks to infect a billion people in less than twenty four hours ive managed to find the answer the answer to the pitiful selfish and self important breed that the human race has become when i give my gift to the wind the world will become free again it will be reborn a simple and beautiful place for every creature great and small surviving on instinct alone
1468057 and youre dead youre not going to be here when my miracle graces this earth i i deprive you of my gift both of you when the sun comes up tomorrow there will be peace and neither of you will ever know a second of it
1468058 put that gun in your ugly face and pull the trigger die

1468071 and thats the order in which were going to do it
1468072 while we are relieved that none of our members or chapters were at risk we grieve for the victims of the anthrax attacks and their families and on behalf of our members express our sympathy to all who have been personally touched by these tragic events
1468073 ive got healthy skepticism its good to be the skeptic the bottom line is we want to see this perpetrator brought to justice

1468102 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1468103 i think the market realizes that this kind of pressure may in fact lead to a change in policy
1468104 the beginning of a movement and the beginning of an industry
1468105 recent research has shown the higher the level of noise the more people drink
1468106 the issue for me is more about trying to change this culture where people go out and get bladdered and fall down in the street
1468107 we are not saying we are anti drink it is about responsible and safe drinking
1468108 8 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us 9 much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him 10 for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life 11 and not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement
1468109 1 amends or reparation made for an injury or wrong expiation 2 a reconciliation or an instance of reconciliation between god and humans b atonement christianity the reconciliation of god and humans brought about by the redemptive life and death of jesus
1468110 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life

1468113 approximately 1 500 years later on the 14th day of nisan the passover lamb of god jesus christ was sacrificed upon a wooden cross for the sins of all mankind when the day of the lord comes those who have covered themselves in the blood of the lamb by accepting christ will be kept safe while the world pays for their rebellion against god

1468116 we are having to make some very difficult choices in order to put the post office network on a more stable footing for the future
1468117 we appreciate that this is an upsetting time for the staff and customers of any post office branch that is proposed for closure
1468118 the general feeling is we were doing well enough to escape the first lot so whats changed since then
1468119 please do everything you can to defeat the senate version of hr 6304 the fisa amendments act of 2008 please use your power to filibuster
1468120 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1468121 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1468122 we continue to deliver iphones to direct fulfillment customers every day
1468123 i dont have any doubts that on the whole and i think this is a belief universally shared on the team that fallout is a better game but were also not oblivious to the fact that we have a lot of extra baggage that were carrying being the guys picking up this franchise that are re imagining this series from 10 years ago and theres something that comes along with that were very well aware of what were up against have no doubts in my mind that at its core and for everything that it provides that fallout 3 is a better game than oblivion was for sure
1468124 now it looks like that could be still be another couple of months off
1468125 theyre a continuation of our efforts in security but theyre also a reflection of a changing threat environment
1468126 customers are always asking whats the most important thing to get done when we release security updates
1468127 the new exploitability index helps with that problem were going to give predictions on how exploitable each issue is
1468128 its another piece of information another piece to the puzzle
1468129 i think its usefulness will depend on the implementation and how accurate the predictions are but it should help emphasize the need to look at exploitability as one of the factors in deciding what to patch
1468130 mapp will give the protection providers a head start and should shorten the time between our updates and their protection we recognize that its a race
1468131 i dont have to tell you that this takes some people at microsoft outside their comfort level
1468132 but the problems in security today are so large that no one vendor can deliver a solution by themselves were pushing the envelope here
1468133 well do the reverse engineering in many cases that will id where the vulnerability is
1468134 you have to give them credit that theyre putting effort into the security process
1468135 its not a silver bullet to the problem but more information is always better both of these are kind of interesting and show that microsoft is being more proactive in the security space
1468136 bikers are pretty much aware that when we enforce we enforce straight on so theyll actually just speed past our van sometimes knowing full well that we cant identify them
1468137 in the last few weeks ive caught about half a dozen motorcycles using this technology
1468138 in the past when the bike came past we had to read the number plate with our eyes as they went past which was a bit hit and miss

1468165 i believe that marriages that have been entered into subsequent to the may 15 supreme court opinion will be recognized by the california supreme court

1468184 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
1468185 those are women who we spent our lifetime helping run for office
1468186 a lot of us are not happy with these women for not supporting hillary because they came to us for help based in large part on their gender
1468187 would be outraged to know she was not given that right of first refusal
1468188 clinton is now seen as the reigning dean of the womens movement its sort of moses gets all the way to the mountain and doesnt get to the promised land and i think there would be people really angry about that
1468189 i already had a job so i didnt think i was interested in applying
1468190 i have a love for fitness and at a young age i knew wanted something more like owning a business im just glad i could do both
1468191 i think being proactive right now is better in the long run for a business
1468192 i think the work force is becoming a sellers market and businesses will have to adapt
1468193 we had several people mention how they had gone to fountain before and were looking for a new place to get toys particularly ones that had a more education focus to them
1468194 we felt it was time to try and answer that need
1468195 weve learned that in order to compete as a small specialty business its important to have a volume of products so you dont run out as well as have variety
1468196 were easy to find as soon as youve been here once but we still get calls every week from people asking for directions
1468197 the one advantage customers have found is that this is a very calming area where its easy to find parking
1468198 quite often the questions these days are financial and the main problem is not following through on the math
1468199 it seems simple to do but i can see how it gets overlooked
1468200 if youre focused on making the best cupcake you can a person might not be thinking about things like how triple net would impact expenses
1468201 if you dont have any money to start a business a bank is not going to give you a loan no matter how great the business plan is
1468202 from what im seeing these days if you have 1 and a great plan a bank might be willing to invest 3 but even thats tough right now
1468203 the joke is people only want to open coffee shops around here but were seeing business plans for manufacturing lawyer firms and dentist offices
1468204 once every three years a business owner should see if they should make a switch i always found it to be worthwhile
1468205 overall its been going great and were very happy about the response in the neighborhood
1468206 ive been happy to see how weve been able to turn that around
1468207 weve really focused on catering to that lastminute caller which represents almost 30 percent of this business
1468208 it gives us a chance to cater to local shoppers as well as the canadian market
1468209 for years afterward i couldnt drive by the office after it had failed it was that painful for me
1468210 it can become hard to remember that there are worse things than losing a business such as going to jail or losing friends and family from bad decisions
1468211 most small business people realize that but it can be forgotten if you are too wrapped up in the business and not looking at the bigger picture
1468212 if you explain yourself to people and why youve made a decision they may be disappointed or maybe not agree with you but they will appreciate the fact you were honest with them
1468213 find someone you can trust and dont hesitate to ask questions
1468214 i think it would lessen the value of being a moral person whats more important is just doing the right thing
1468215 were hoping this will be the type of place people can stop by to pick up fresh food for dinner or other meals filling in for the things they didnt get at the farmers market
1468216 its a chance to bring back more of the shopping that day for meals concept getting food that came from the farm a few hours ago
1468217 as soon as the sun comes out though well have a lot of great stuff including berries
1468218 they have been my daily companions and knowing them has enriched my life
1468219 running a restaurant is a challenging business so its the people you meet that make the difference
1468220 patricia seems to be one of those people who will be here getting to know the customer like i was
1468221 thats really the way you have success in restaurants this isnt one of those businesses where you just collect the money at the end of the day you have to be the driving force
1468222 we started off as a quick place to get coffee and pastries but the drive throughs took over that market
1468223 we became more about being a place where friends can meet over coffee and relax
1468224 you can get good food anywhere but as soon as someone has bad service they wont be back
1468225 its a lot of work to maintain that but im so glad i did it im leaving with a lot of great memories
1468226 weve already had several trader joes customers walk in and set up an appointment
1468227 ive always been impressed by the amount of traffic they trader joes create
1468228 there has definitely been a trend nationwide the last five years for families to shop at consignment stores its not just the affordability factor but its a form of recycling that people prefer
1468229 ive always liked this neighborhood and its great to see more people out and about
1468230 its going pretty well right now although we know people are anxious for us to get open
1468231 we have a lot of people peeking through the windows watching what were doing
1468232 we want to make sure we have the proper staffing and setup because first impressions will be important
1468233 i wanted to do something different that still involved serving people and this is it
1468234 i cant thank all the people whove supported me for 12 years at the restaurant so i hope they can come here to relax
1468235 all those people who have been looking show up early to get the items they have had their eye on
1468236 dvd kiosk rental seemed like a great deal in arizona and i was surprised i didnt see one when we moved back here
1468237 i talked to my dad who showed interest himself so we decided to do this together
1468238 i always had a couple of balls in the air because i felt it was important to have multiple income streams and services
1468239 to make it work though i cant overstate enough the importance of fun when doing these things
1468240 this is 10 million times easier than a day at the zoo picking up waste
1468241 with this business im outdoors and able to do something most people hate so i know im providing a good service

1468343 the right authority to determine her legal entity is the nrd based on her ic therefore the appellant must get approval from the nrd to change the muslim name to her chinese name which was rejected by the nrd

1468370 hey its the pizza hut and the party store stimulus act
1468371 greetings my friend we are all interested in the future for that is where you and i are going to spend the rest of our lives
1468372 transhumanism is the idea that its ok to transcend the limitations of the body and brain and take control of reproduction
1468373 and add to that the belief that its probably a good idea
1468374 within 30 years we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence shortly thereafter the human era will be ended
1468375 you might get things in the next 10 or 20 years that would have taken 200 years before
1468376 i guess my real motivation is the desire to not have a lot of clutter around me and just have one computer or one brain interface
1468377 the more tangible advantage of the efficiency is that you could have better emergency responses and better human experiences
1468378 eating kind of distracts me from whatever else im doing
1468379 im kind of weird that way im more concerned with my health than how things taste ive always cared about maximizing my happiness
1468380 it goes back to the enlightenment about 400 years or so
1468381 and when you go back to those original ideas you see a number of things emerging among them the notion that science and tech can be applied to human affairs and things can be engineered and improved upon
1468382 our paleolithic selves had certain limitations and invented technologies to allow us to get beyond them for us theres continuity between what happened then and what were talking about now
1468383 there are some guys who put a lot of faith in the code and the engineers and guys who work on boxes
1468384 others of us are more interested in the social dimension and global collaboration there are a lot of different baggages we bring to these things
1468385 we might come to a point in the immediate future where it will be impossible to imagine what goes beyond it
1468386 theres been more than half a century of research indicating that caloric restriction in animal models works
1468387 caloric restriction works it goes back to studies in the 1940s that show that if you feed laboratory animals less calories they live much longer and age better there is other data to support that
1468388 thats basically the production of molecules that can damage the body
1468389 theyre molecules that can oxidize proteins or dna all the major building blocks of cells and bodies the thought is that the more we eat and the longer we live the more we damage these cells and if you eat less then you create less damage
1468390 there are people who believe in this and are doing it
1468391 the problem is they dont appear particularly happy or healthy on the question of quality of life its very difficult most people would be miserable
1468392 the french eat all these fats breads cheeses and do lots of things they shouldnt do and they actually live longer and have less disease than we do in north america
1468393 and its been proposed that they live longer because they drink a lot of red wine and its not just the wine but the red pigment actually seems to have beneficial properties
1468394 there appears to be a connection between that compound and slowing down oxidation damage
1468395 in other words theres now for the first time the potential for having a drug that will mimic the effects of things that no one wants to do like caloric restriction or severe exercise itll be a drug well all happily pay a lot of money to pop down and the pharmaceutical industry will happily make a killing on it
1468396 i think we have a 50 percent chance of getting there in around 25 years so long as the early proof of concept work in mice is well enough funded for the next 10 years or so
1468397 as soon as we get that gerontologists the world over will be on television saying yes aubrey was right the repair and maintenance approach to postponing aging really is feasible after all
1468398 the sens concept is inspired by the realization that human metabolism is far too complex and interconnected to improve bio medically in the foreseeable future and that an alternative akin to repair and maintenance of man made machines is far more promising
1468399 the debate is largely framed by transhumanists who are looking for rationales for all the enhancement technologies
1468400 and its framed on the other side by people largely motivated by religious or conservative concerns those people are either fearful of this technology or see it as a rallying cry for conservative social positions
1468401 thats based on a lot of assumptions that we really dont know about the brain
1468402 there are some major thresholds and no one knows if were going to reach them or not
1468403 i love the can do spirit i love the idea that well try to tackle these problems but that doesnt mean that were going to tackle them in the near future
1468404 inquiring knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect

1468418 the combination of suse linux enterprise server and lotus foundations represents a significant step forward in the simplification of this environment it provides an affordable reliable easy to use software appliance for small and medium businesses and opens new opportunities for business partners to simplify the development and deployment of software applications for those same companies were excited to further extend our close partnership with ibm and be selected as the first company to deliver solutions for this important initiative the next wave of software delivery is here
1468419 i was there from the beginning when ibm lotus domino was being considered for a nitix offering and provided input on the necessary steps to deploy applications into an integrated domino server i never envisioned it to become such a simple process with wizard drive interfaces
1468420 domino isvs are excited about this because it opens a new market opportunity them to sell domino applications to small businesses
1468421 because this is a software appliance these applications can be deployed into environments that may not have on site domino administrators suddenly the sky is the limit for domino developers
1468422 mid market businesses typically have lean it organizations which can limit their ability to migrate their applications as their needs grow
1468423 ibms linux based software appliances provide a fully integrated solution from the operating system to the application and everything in between for our business partners to deploy in each customers environment the software appliances reduce the complexity of deploying new applications by minimizing the installation and configuration process business partners can move into higher value services more quickly helping grow their revenue
1468424 by working with ibm on a software appliance solution stradasoft can free up its technical consultants from sales and train its business consultants to do the job instead
1468425 the appliance solution reduces installation time for our customers from one to two days to only a few hours

1468429 ibm software and linux on desktop combined is not just a better price performance substitute for the microsoft offering but it provides a new platform for customers and business partners to add true value by creating tailor made solutions
1468430 the combined power of eclipse and lotus offered in a stable and secure linux environment at less then half the cost of the equivalent microsoft offering will create a new ecosystem for solution providers and developers and set new standards in value for the money for the customers
1468431 we are pleased with the uptake among customers including enterprises governments small businesses and partners adopting occs powered by red hats enterprise linux desktop
1468432 customers are demanding a microsoft less pc and we have responded with our reliable secure linux solution through our top channel partners worldwide building on the success weve seen in eastern europe and other markets
1468433 novell is excited to partner with ibm to drive desktop innovation and deliver the open collaboration client solution to enterprises worldwide
1468434 as the best engineered and most interoperable linux from the desktop to the data center suse linux enterprise is a strong fit for ibm the unique combination of ibms lotus software powered by suse linux enterprise desktop enables enterprises to strengthen security improve flexibility and dramatically lower costs compared to vista in addition deployment is made very easy with a seamless one click installation feature
1468435 we are excited about distributing lotus symphony from canonical online store

1468447 muscle and weight is very important in the star class
1468448 its quite a heavy boat and you have to be strong to sail it
1468449 very happy with how we are prepared and how the boat is going
1468450 there is a lot of swell in china and not a lot of breeze maybe two or three knots and a lot of tide so conditions are very different from anything any of us have really sailed in
1468451 we have spent a lot of time getting the boat set up the way we like it but it has been worth the effort
1468452 the fact that we are competing at the olympics will only set in when we see the thousands of people at the opening ceremony
1468453 having said that we have sailed against all the guys we are sailing against before and we know them all personally so we will not be meeting strangers out there
1468454 the sailing will definitely be up a level and tactics in sailing have changed
1468455 it is going to be very exciting although i imagine the nerves will be bad at the start

1468577 we certainly need an action plan whats the scripture without a vision my people will perish
1468578 ive always been a person who believes in processes and planning
1468579 i dont know how we can go somewhere if we dont know where were going to put it in simplistic terms im very concerned about us not prioritizing what we need to do and how we need to do it i really struggle with bringing things to the table that have not been prioritized or understanding what we want to do first second third and fourth
1468580 that we not do it but ive sat in these things all day and we plan and we plan and weve got 15 things going on and we get back and nothing gets done
1468581 i think we ought to sit down what are we going to do for the next two to four years i dont have to worry about 2015 i may not be here then
1468582 well begin in a month or two and they may have already started on the 2010 budget so weve got work a little beyond two years in terms or looking at resources and thinking about how were going to make these things happen
1468583 everywhere i go i see vision im sick of vision really im sick of the word dream whatever plan i dont mind a plan i just know how i work as an individual i see something that needs to be done i try to get it done i go to the next one im a one project guy one two three four five
1468584 i can see what youre saying there is you want to prioritize i think of heres the eda the pre emption lights and theyre coming out of me one at a time but im not trying to overload the staff im trying to do one and say bring it to council and lets do that but i can understand your concern about whats coming up
1468585 i dont have any problem with the council coming up with a priority list but i cant do its hard for me to do 10 projects 10 balls in the air i like to do one knock it out go to the next thats just the way i do things
1468586 and i understand and respect that frank but there are five of us here
1468587 i like the idea of the bucket list so that we can keep these issues before us and so we can have benchmarks and can make sure that were making progress on them
1468588 the energy crisis isnt going away any time soon so congress should get back to work do their job and offer real energy solutions to the american people
1468589 america can no longer afford to send over 700 billion annually of our nations wealth to hostile foreign countries when we have the ability and resources to develop our own domestic energy sources and create hundreds of thousands of jobs right here at home i firmly believe that this is not only an issue of the need to develop our own energy independence but its also an issue of american national security
1468590 if congress had already voted for more drilling and more oil production in this country gas prices would have never risen above 4 per gallon but now even in the face of millions of americans suffering financially across america due to soaring transportation food and housing costs speaker pelosi has put a blockade around any real energy legislation thanks to her running the house like her own personal pelosi politburo we are facing a moratorium on drilling and a moratorium on votes that is why im returning to washington to protest
1468591 we must end the age of oil in our time
1468592 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
1468593 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
1468594 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
1468595 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
1468596 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
1468597 he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
1468598 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
1468599 i like the rhythm in your booty you could really do your duty
1468600 the main danger with all this is if people read all over the world and on cnn that 11 people are confirmed dead the motivation for actually risking your life and going up there to rescue people stops
1468601 ive never seen missing people actually be declared dead on such a scale but ive seen people declared dead and coming back after 4 to 5 days even on k2
1468602 i think there were some tactical errors made but it wasnt the tactics that killed them
1468603 you can point and say they got to the summit at 8 oclock in the dark that was a mistake but it wasnt what killed them you can say those people on oxygen probably ran out of oxygen but thats not what killed them what killed them was the ice fall
1468604 we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they didnt trust it anymore
1468605 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem
1468606 i dont know whether this was a fight over principles this was a fight over power
1468607 the election commission clearly declared kibaki to be the winner and the loser refused to accept the result and refused to accept the internationally accepted method for resolving the dispute going to court
1468608 now that we have got this problem you will not leave you have to get in touch with our leaders
1468609 what mattered to us was that we wanted to stop the mayhem and we wanted people to talk
1468610 this is probably the biggest year weve ever had for sales tax holidays
1468611 at one time the tax system was used to raise revenue and right now its being used to implement this or that social policy or goal
1468612 with regard to sales tax holidays economists uniformly pan them and elected officials love them
1468613 theyre not hugely costly but the impact on the total amount of spending by consumers is virtually indiscernible no state should expect any boost to the economy from a sales tax holiday
1468614 this summer has not been a graceful one for retailers but will consumers let go of their purse strings for the tax holiday thats the 64 000 question
1468615 in the short term that means less money to spend but in the long term it could stimulate the economy
1468616 we all have access to sales that were much higher than 5 percent at other points of the year so i felt we still had our opportunity to buy these consumer items
1468617 consumers see it as a chance to stick it to the government and the total revenue impact is basically a wash

1468619 it will be a key driver to decide who wins

1468633 it is not difficult to imagine similar scenarios in the it branch or among engineers secretaries or nurses

1468760 this money enables us to make sure people not only survive but they can start to live lives that are as normal and dignified as possible education and protection are essential to this

1468878 two check ins and sometimes a missed connection for one trip from new orleans to phoenix not ideal
1468879 lower prices mean less pain at the pump but tougher times ahead for the economy
1468880 but as the governments fiscal stimulus program did earlier this year it lower oil prices could give consumers a little more change in their pockets either to spend salt away or pay down their debts

1468884 we dont believe the security or privacy of these would be members will be compromised in any way but out of an abundance of caution and in keeping with a policy of always leveling with our members we wanted to issue this warning regardless of which state law may or may not require it
1468885 oil prices today are getting hammered on more signs that point to demand destruction
1468886 it appears that the weak economic numbers coming out of the uk will put pressure on the eurozone to worry more about growth and less about inflation and perhaps cut interest rates
1468887 rising supplies from opec are making participants painfully aware that deteriorating economic activity is making less and less of a call on stockpiles
1468888 his manner the environment officers was aggressive and offensive throughout
1468889 he didnt even introduce himself with any basic courtesies i felt intimidated humiliated and threatened
1468890 i decided id had enough and shut the door on him i was just shutting the top bolt too when he started pushing against the door
1468891 i thought what sort of state of state do we live in where people are being persecuted and intimidated in this way for what they found an address label with some rubbish at a recycling point
1468892 when my car was vandalised a couple of years ago it took three phone calls and a week to get a policeman round to my house but here we have a policeman coming round to my house with a recycling officer within less than half an hour
1468893 we try and keep the recycle centres and places where people take their refuse tidy and we have signs that we want to keep it tidy
1468894 i personally find it annoying when i go to a recycling centre to find lots of cardboard bags and sacks all around
1468895 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1468896 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime
1468897 documents describing the creation of explosives as well as excerpts from the anarchists arsenal
1468898 siddiquis papers included descriptions of various landmarks in the united states including in new york city
1468899 may the blood of unintelligible be directly on your unintelligible possibly head or hands

1468901 in this troubled economy many people are struggling to pay their bills debt collectors are entitled to pursue payment of legitimate debts but they must do so fairly and in compliance with the law

1468903 ive always been interested and thought it would be a lot of fun
1468904 just try to look at what you have and just get the facts and not interpret anything
1468905 to us its more minor but to the person it happened to it is very important and they can be very upset this will make people feel better and we are being proactive
1468906 i think its going to allow us to deliver the same level of customer service which is pretty good kloss said
1468907 they can handle some calls and it will allow us full time cst to use our experience where its needed
1468908 it wasnt in the budget was it an emergency perhaps but what created the emergency
1468909 partly a sentiment index if things are not getting as bad at a slower rate it can feel like improvement
1468910 qualitatively it changes nothing about our assessment of the economy growth is at best weak and inflation pressures remain elevated

1468914 she was very witty clever and funny she was followed by her husband ben then matt damon the men gave serious political speeches on how the country needs change

1468917 one of them wanted winter camp and one of them wanted camp hawaii
1468918 weve been looking into scheduling when we can do that because weve been busy with touring but we would love to

1468920 in the event of a decision against iran this country will suffer the same outcome as iraq iran is not any stronger than iraq and wont have the means to resist a military attack on its own

1468934 the religion of the state of the islamic republic of afghanistan is the sacred religion of islam

1468943 the assumption that spending more of the taxpayers money will make things better has survived all kinds of evidence that it has made things worse
1468944 fully aware of the dangerous consequences attending on the admission of women
1468945 when the record discounts or ignores women the community is telling itself and its women something about womens potential and place in the community likewise when women studies discovers a past for women even a heroic past in some cases the whole community is reshaped therefore the stories that people tell the history they remember are crucial to empowering or disempowering whole segments of the community
1468946 nuns in india are very different from those of china
1468947 but an illusion is without any determinate innate characteristics so how could it be changed
1468948 all things are also without any determinate innate characteristics so how could you ask why dont you change your female sex
1468949 i do not know how i changed nor how i changed into a female form
1468950 sariputra if you can change into a female form then all women can also change just as you are not really a woman but appear to be female in form all women also only appear to be female in form but are not really women therefore the buddha said all are not really men or women
1468951 the female form and innate characteristics neither exist nor do not exist
1468952 on march 26 2008 amazon representative john clifford notified plaintiff that amazon would only continue to sell plaintiffs pod books through the direct amazon sales channel if plaintiff agreed to print its books through amazons printing service booksurge rather than lightning source
1468953 we are here to compete and we will focus on what we do best that is to swim fast whatever else other countries are doing is not of interest to us
1468954 i do not think this meet is just about us and the americans the french are strong the british finished fourth in the points at last years world championships and i think there will be several other countries that will win medals
1468955 i admired him for his internal honesty and his willingness to stand up very intensively for his own views
1468956 of course nothing is eternal but i hope every generation will have a person such as him
1468957 you get the impression that the younger generations know nothing about him
1468958 i may have read something by solzhenitsyn in school but i dont remember
1468959 i dont know him so why should i go and pay last respects to him
1468960 we have a recovery plan in place and have forecast a surplus in our annual plan for 2008 9
1468961 the full extent of which were not brought to the attention of the trust board or disclosed to monitor until june 2008
1468962 the trust experienced significant pressures in 2006 07 and in 2007 8
1468963 this included short term reduction in activity as primary care trusts reviewed commissioning preferences in the early part of the year and increased costs for externally provided services medical staffing and national pay restructuring
1468964 this is a challenging position for the trust and is one that we are confident of managing
1468965 well like to make a game thats fun to play and looks cool

1468969 the fed is caught between fears of inflation and financial market uncertainty
1468970 although we clearly face more challenging macro economic conditions in fiscal 09 were well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth
1468971 i want to save money for my family for my childs education and future
1468972 my parents are old now and need me to earn for the family
1468973 there is not just one india that we look at
1468974 theres this wonderful pyramid that is india there is the top and then there is the emerging middle class that is really growing
1468975 but really the people we are looking at for opportunities run all the way down the pyramid whether they are day labours drivers or people who work on the land as farmers
1468976 the investigators are well aware that their work is not exempt from imperfections
1468977 they worked with an enormous margin of error and they achieved very little in terms of conclusive results especially with regards to the fate of the unfortunate child
1468978 this is not unfortunately a police story a crime fit for the investigative mind of a sherlock holmes or a hercule poirot guided by the illusion that the forces of law and justice always restore order
1468979 no element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid sensible serious and honest conclusion about the circumstances of madeleines disappearance
1468980 including and most dramatically establishing whether she is alive or dead which seems more probable
1468981 it is obvious that neither of the defendants gerald or kate acted with intent
1468982 they could not predict that the resort where they had chosen to spend a few days holiday would leave the lives of any of their children in danger
1468983 it was located in a quiet place where the majority of residents are foreign citizens of the same nationality and without any known history of this type of crime
1468984 although they left their daughter alone with her siblings in the apartment sometimes for extended periods it is true that in any case they were keeping an eye on them
1468985 we must also recognise that the parents are already paying a heavy penalty the disappearance of madeleine for their carelessness in monitoring and protecting their children
1468986 it seems obvious to us that the crimes of exposure or abandonment can be eliminated
1468987 well like to make a game thats fun to play and looks cool
1468988 oye que te voy a registrar por si llevas armas o algo vale
1468989 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan
1468990 carrying what were seen as india influenced intelligence inputs had hardened the resolve of pakistans security establishment to keep supreme pakistans national security interest even if it meant straining ties with the us and nato
1468991 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
1468992 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
1468993 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006
1468994 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan
1468995 have long been intrigued by the presence of highly encrypted communications gear with mehsud this communication gear enables him to collect real time information on pakistani troop movements from an unidentified foreign source without being intercepted by pakistani intelligence
1468996 pakistani military leaders rubbished the american information and evidence on the kabul bombing but provided some rationale for keeping a window open with haqqani just as the british government had decided to open talks with some taliban leaders in southern afghanistan last year
1468997 al bashir and the icc the intense heated sudanese facebook debate summed up in two pictures that speak 2 000 words
1468998 they succeeded in iraq and they want to have their go in sudan now
1468999 the iccs decision is based on secular laws and not gods laws therefore its haram sinful to support the icc in any way
1469000 together against the icc lets unite for president omar victory
1469001 jews and christians have been trying to help the muslims have done nothing
1469002 youre looking at a regime change in khartoum dude or at least a change of the head of state
1469003 i love how many sudanese believe in the american israeli conspiracy but on a serious note what many sudanese diaspora and vocal anti bashir foreigners dont realize is that if bashir and co suddenly disappear or are removed by force a sizable power vacuum is going to be created and thats not a situation a fragmented country like sudan wants to be in can you imagine the anarchy imagine somalia on a larger scale
1469004 if al bashir were gone leaving office vertically or horizontally it doesnt really matter to me who would be in a position to take over in sudan
1469005 one year ago the u n security council stood unanimous and promised darfurians the strongest and largest protection force ever
1469006 today that force is just over a third deployed lacks even the most basic equipment and is unable to protect itself let alone civilians
1469007 like i said earlier many people in the arab world and in the arab diaspora doubt or deny that quntar is guilty in the allegations
1469008 however it helps strenghtening hezbollahs position in lebanon which i am unhappy with

1469040 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1469041 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1469042 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1469043 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1469044 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1469045 i am a believer in knowing what you are doing when you apply for a job if i were to seriously consider running on a national ticket i would essentially have to start now before having served a day in the senate now theres some people who might be comfortable doing that but im not one of those people

1469064 he said im not leaving youre going to have to make me leave so when he went outside they locked the door and that was a good thing for safety reasons
1469065 this does not constitute a priority one emergency for us to stop what were doing and to run to this individual youre talking about the fuel the officer who is handling one call to leave another call this did not constitute us stopping what were doing and going to this individual to render assistance

1469067 i would have to credit indiegogo for being there at a time when we needed them to forklift us
1469068 filmmakers are only a decade or so behind rock bands in the realization that they have to start developing a list or database for people who like their movies
1469069 the good news is that once youve built this audience they might help fund your next movie la indiegogo they might just buy the dvd they might come out to a theater they might tell their friends and help you market it i think it can be really powerful once you have this direct connection with the audience
1469070 you can have your own site you can have a myspace site you can have a facebook site you can have a youtube site and all of these different sites that youre using as a multi platform promotional campaign you can link to one place on indiegogo its like a one stop shop for everything about your project

1469122 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1469123 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1469124 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1469125 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1469126 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1469127 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1469128 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1469129 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1469130 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1469131 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1469132 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1469133 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1469134 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1469135 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1469136 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1469137 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now
1469138 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1469139 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked

1469165 id always played soccer and i guess my long term goal was to play for australia
1469166 i was thinking that if things went well maybe at 20 or 21 i might move to brisbane to see how far i could go
1469167 i wasnt really too interested in afl back then although i used to watch the brisbane lions on tv although that all changed when i started playing
1469168 we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1469169 further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1469170 perchlorate is becoming a serious threat to human health and water resources
1469171 when surprising results are found we want to review and assure our extensive pre launch contamination control processes covered this potential
1469172 were all very flabbergasted at the data we got back
1469173 we basically have found what appears to be the requirements to support life whether in the past present or future
1469174 we have elements that you might find in your backyard
1469175 some kinds of earth life would be happy to live in these soils
1469176 perchlorates will tell us quite a bit about the history of water
1469177 not just at the phoenix site but in other parts of mars
1469178 its a very effective agent for soaking up water like a silica gel packet
1469179 when its very wet it forms a sticky substance at very low temperature like antifreeze
1469180 there are microbes that live on the energy contained by this oxidant
1469181 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1469182 there were reports over the weekend that indicated that nasa had a major discovery that nasa was withholding from the public todays teleconference is going to set the record straight
1469183 we have substantial evidence that our soil samples has perchlorates
1469184 they are highly stable and do not destroy life under normal conditions in fact there are microbes that live on the energy contained by this oxidant in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1469185 we dont know what mixture of perchlorate salts we have in our solution sodium perchlorate ammonium perchlorate magnesium perchlorate lets take magnesium perchlorate its a very effective agent for soaking up water like silica gel packet when its very wet it forms a sticky substance at very low temperature like antifreeze weve only begun to think about what this might mean but they could keep a lot of graduate students busy for a long time
1469186 its a stable molecule and it doesnt preclude life on earth in fact it could be an energy source
1469187 there were some initial reports in the the scientific literature that the atacama was very mars like they couldnt find organics or culture microbes but as research continued we found organics and then when we looked closer we found microbes so it turned around microbes can exist quite happily in oxidizing conditions and the story could be the same for mars we dont know for sure
1469188 the other probes had different focuses than the meca wet chem which is looking for soluble salt and perchlorate is a very soluble salt
1469189 because perchlorates are chemically inert they move through the soil very quickly in the presence of water this ties back to mars perchlorates will tell us quite a bit about the history of water not just at the phoenix site but in other parts of mars
1469190 nasa is investigating whether the substance could have gotten there by contamination before launch
1469191 even the scientists admitted to having to hit the textbooks on how it works perhaps the most intriguing suggestion was that magnesium perchlorate can act as a sort of anti freeze in the presence of water

1469200 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
1469201 its a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
1469202 my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring the team is properly prepared and plays to its full potential starting on thursday
1469203 jeff merkleys proven leadership on global warming and clean energy will help to break the senate stalemate in washington
1469204 speaker merkleys plan to deal with global warming will simultaneously end americas addiction to oil protect the planet for future generations and bring clean energy jobs to oregon he knows that oregon families deserve real energy choices
1469205 as the speaker of the house jeff merkley has made oregon a leader in clean energy alternatives
1469206 his 96 lifetime environmental score in the legislature reflects his commitment to clean air clean water and oregons natural beauty oregon will miss him in the legislature but america deserves jeff merkleys leadership in the senate
1469207 with the exception of congressman walden gordon smith has the lowest environmental score of any member of the oregon delegation
1469208 in 2005 smith voted to kill a resolution that put the senate on record saying that global warming is real and that mandatory limits are necessary to slow stop and reverse the growth of global warming pollution roll call 149 amendment 866 22 june 2005
1469209 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career
1469210 being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
1469211 within the game worldwide he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone
1469212 hopefully his captaincy will be similar to his batting positive instinctive and entertaining
1469213 i must say and congratulate ipl for such a great marketing team they have and lets give credit to icl what a great cricketing icl matches we had one should learn something from their ipls marketing thing he said
1469214 nobody said to me what wrong we are doing nobody is giving me an answer kapil dev said
1469215 if mahendra singh dhoni comes and plays icl will he play for india or not if tomorrow sachin tendulkar plays in icl will he play for the country or not he asked
1469216 we are open to idea of their ipl joining us
1469217 the idea of twenty20 cricket at the olympics is definitely worth pursuing
1469218 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1469219 i had the time of my life at those games winning the gold medal was one of the highlights of my career
1469220 twenty20 is going through a honeymoon phase at the moment
1469221 but in the next few years i believe it will become a worldwide phenomenon
1469222 take it from someone who has won almost everything cricket has to offer the olympics is the absolute pinnacle in sport
1469223 the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience
1469224 i have 11 sports assigned to me and equestrianism is one of them
1469225 i met the team i was asking most of the questions it was not about me telling them how to ride a horse but really talking about how to handle pressure situations
1469226 we met yesterday and spoke about graham hes going to be available for selection hes done a lot of things right over the last couple of weeks
1469227 his attitude to training his fitness and the attitude hes gone back to port adelaide with has been sensational
1469228 so full credit to graham and hes committed to a long term plan now so were looking forward to the benefits of seeing graham play some great footy for us
1469229 graham had some guidelines of what we wanted to see and hes delivered that over the last couple of weeks
1469230 his preparations improved weve seen that we know he can do it and its just a matter of doing it on a longer basis
1469231 the stuff jason showed over the last couple of weeks is definitely about our culture
1469232 hahaha now hattrick will pay for what he did now i will ban hattrick
1469233 noi siamo pikkoli ma cresceremo allora virgola ce la faremo chiusa parentesi riporto 6 nn siamo pikkoli ma dateci del lei
1469234 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career
1469235 being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
1469236 within the game worldwide he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone
1469237 the one thing we dont want is for kevin to change he averages 50 plus in test and one day cricket and he is an unbelievable talent
1469238 the first innings against south africa in the first test at lords earlier this summer was the one for me
1469239 he is a bit nervous at first but gets his head down and blazes a hundred that is a measure of the man when you see things like that i am sure he will take to captaincy in the same way he will take it in his stride
1469240 it is a tough job it is not just about being on the field moving the field about and changing the bowlers around
1469241 the thing is trying to leave it on the cricket field
1469242 michael said it affected him at home and he took the work home and i did that as well
1469243 you also need help from the rest of the side
1469244 could steve carells creepy role in the office hurt his emmy hopes
1469245 an 18 year old who is talented at cricket and a football code can now look at the ipl champions twenty20 league the big bash tournament in whatever form it is in and an olympic gold medal as well as the pinnacle representing your country in test cricket and stay in the game its appealing for five reasons
1469246 often players have felt they havent had as big an input into administrative decisions so its a great time for the administrators and the players to get together and work towards it if everyone believes in it
1469247 the players ive spoken to believe in it and theyd love to be part of some sort of push to get in there and at least present our case
1469248 poor chris gorog back in 2002 hed just struck a deal to acquire the insolvent napsters assets including its name and iconic kitty logo for 5 million gorog renamed his company napster and launched a paid music subscription service insisting the brand alone would draw millions of customers
1469249 well that didnt happen today napster headquartered in los angeles has only 760 000 subscribers who pay about 13 a month to listen to its library of 6 million songs
1469250 napster continues to face tough competition from realnetworks rhapsody today rhapsody boasts 1 9 million subscribers including users of its steaming radio service
1469251 the company has never been profitable napster lost 16 million in its most recent fiscal year ending in march on what it described in a press release as record revenues of 127 5 million wall street has pretty much given up napsters stock price has fallen 69 to 1 44 in the 3 1 2 years since its re launch
1469252 now the situation is about to get more absurd the 55 year old gorog who declined comment is trying to fend off a proxy campaign bankrolled by kavan singh a 26 year old entrepreneur who owns among other enterprises a chain of cold stone creamery ice cream stores
1469253 singh and two other disgruntled investors all enthusiastic napster subscribers are vying for board seats at the companys sept 18 annual meeting
1469254 heres another reason why napster could be in the news it has a market cap of 67 million but as of may napster had 69 8 million in cash thats caused some of the companys largest shareholders to increase their holdings in hopes the company will be acquired
1469255 the most obvious potential buyer is realnetworks which declined to comment but perhaps realnetworks ceo rob glaser should wait until napsters shares fall a little more havent we all learned what happens when you invest too much in a famous name
1469256 today rhapsody boasts 1 9 million subscribers including users of its steaming radio service
1469257 and if readers of mdn dont like their comments go sing kumbayah somewhere
1469258 poor chris gorog back in 2002 hed just struck a deal to acquire the insolvent napsters assets including its name and iconic kitty logo for 5 million gorog renamed his company napster and launched a paid music subscription service insisting the brand alone would draw millions of customers
1469259 today rhapsody boasts 1 9 million subscribers including users of its steaming radio service
1469260 singh and two other disgruntled investors all enthusiastic napster subscribers
1469261 dont forget that before renaming the company napster gorog sold roxios profitable consumer software business like cd dvd authoring burning apps for 80 million to fund a money losing venture what a great business plan
1469262 certainly speaking to him at the end of the test match at edgbaston it was a huge relief
1469263 hes had a fantastic record but had the pressure for a long time i think he thinks its time to look after himself a little bit have a break with the family and then come back and try and show what a quality batter he still is and fight his way back into the team
1469264 hes come to his decision that enough was enough hes had a good run and led england through some great times culminating in that ashes victory in 2005
1469265 he feels the time is right to stand down and let another man have a go hes a really good player still what has been really impressive his how fit he has been
1469266 one of the first things i wanted to do when we were going to offer him the captaincy was to sit down with him and talk to him about where he was coming from and what were his views about where he wanted the side to go and whether they matched with mine
1469267 we sat down and talked for a good hour or so and by the end of it we both felt very confident that we were coming from the same place which was exciting so i drove away quite buoyant and excited about what the future might hold
1469268 what i like about kevin is hes got a view thats going to be important in his captaincy hes passionate hes committed about the way he goes about his cricket
1469269 i know nothing of this story nothing has been said to me nothing is true
1469270 it is important for this great country to open itself to the gospel
1469271 if verified the discovery of these new populations of gorilla are hugely significant for our work as conservationists but we must not be distracted from the very real and present danger these gorillas are in from man and ebola
1469272 there is a danger that we concentrate on the more famous species
1469273 what about the other species that weve identified as in danger there are so many that are on the brink of extinction
1469274 in malaysia sumatra and borneo the big problem is destruction of forests to make way for palm oil and biofuels ironically with biofuels something that is nominally associated with helping the environment can have harmful unintentional consequences
1469275 in 1980 the population density of macaques was as much as 300 individuals per square kilometer in 10 years this had decreased to between 60 to 20 individuals per square kilometer
1469276 imagine the human population of the world reduced to that of one small town thats what we are talking about here
1469277 the habitats in which they live are largely impenetrable and we constantly find new species
1469278 having said that this the western lowland gorillas remains a unique find i dont know if well ever find something on this scale again
1469279 i think the lesson for conservationists today is that yes the world is full of surprises theres a lot of uncharted territory there in central africa there may be other populations

1469290 the best investors recently increased holdings by 40 while the rest decreased their holdings by 19 the best investors began purchasing apwr in jan 2008 at 14 and a few would sell some in may 2008 at 22
1469291 the bet has really paid off for some as the stock has recently hit a 52 week high of 31 89 perhaps the best investors hope for a bit more luck as they have purchased more shares of apwr in the past two weeks
1469292 they have branded pharmaceuticals for neuroscience and actue care such as skelaxin avinza sonata thrombin jmi synercid bicillin intal altace levoxy and cytomel they also manufacture the epipen and sell rights for adenoscan and adenocard to other companies
1469293 the best investors increased their holdings by 22 recently while the rest decreased their holdings by 2 the best investors began purchasing kg in aug 03 at 15 and they would purchase more in apr 05 at 8
1469294 for those who timed the stock close to the bottom the bet paid off for some as they sold at 16 but for a few others they werent so lucky as the stock recently hit 9 again however perhaps the best investors are hoping for a rebound as they have purchased more shares of kg in the past two weeks

1469300 going towards the end of the year and going into 09 and beyond were going to see a lot of very large franchise games come from third parties
1469301 theyre going to be a bit of a surprise theyre going to be like wow thats coming to psp
1469302 she knows nothing theyve never had a conversation about that
1469303 yum brands operates 35 000 restaurants under the kfc taco bell and pizza hut brands
1469304 earnings per share increased 16 for the quarter and 28 year to date not to be overlooked either is the fact yum raised guidance again
1469305 this quarter fewer than 5 of companies in the s amp p 500 can boast this triple whammy beating earnings and revenue estimates and raising guidance
1469306 ironically while most of the other triple whammy stocks enjoyed hefty single and double digit run ups on the announcements yum sold off
1469307 and heres where i think most investors are missing the boat and once again focusing too heavily on the short term yes yums in a pinch food costs are rising and consumers are spending less
1469308 in other words margins are getting squeezed and the company like most others isnt about to raise prices for fear of destroying more demand but margins are only off about 1 across all divisions hardly an amount to panic about
1469309 moreover sales are still increasing at double digit rates so even if yums making a little less on each one pound burrito at taco bell or variety bucket at kfc net profits are still increasing
1469310 not to mention this margin contraction is a short term phenomenon weve already seen commodity prices pull back and this will continue the more demand lightens up bottom line sooner than later yum will get out of this pinch
1469311 even if the margin pressure persists a little longer than we expect it will do little to undermine the long term fundamentals working in the companys favor namely international expansion for six years running yums added at least a thousand new international locations
1469312 ceo david novak expects 2008 to be no different in fact worldwide he expects the company to open 1 600 new units thats 4 4 per day making yum the fastest growing retailer in the world
1469313 of course growth in china is propelling this massive expansion operating profits for yums china division alone jumped 38 in the most recent quarter and it will continue to do so into the foreseeable future
1469314 with only 2 726 china locations yums still in the first inning with the bases loaded and no outs of a tremendous growth story management estimates that china can conservatively support 20 000 locations thats the equivalent of 36 more years of growth at current rates
1469315 and when you tack on a massive 4 billion stock repurchase program a five year average return on equity of 60 a dividend thats quadrupled in four years a non cyclical industry world class leadership and new efforts to reignite same store sales in the united states i have little reservations recommending this stock
1469316 to be clear yum will not be the markets next rocket stock jumping 100 or 200 higher in a short period of time but we can count on it to conservatively deliver annual returns of 20 to 25 and in this market we shouldnt downplay such reliability so by all means keep buying
1469317 for more than a year now we have seen the adverse impact that a slower economy and dramatic decline in consumer confidence have had on our u s business this has resulted in a drop in comparable store sales due to a reduction in customer traffic the pressure on store unit economics has required us to take a serious look at our store portfolio
1469318 re igniting our emotional attachment with our customers by restoring the connection our customers have with you our coffee our brand and our stores unlike many other places that sell coffee starbucks built the equity of our brand through the starbucks experience it comes to life every day in the relationship our people have with our customers by focusing again on the starbucks experience we will create a renewed level of meaningful differentiation and separation in the market between us and others who are attempting to sell coffee
1469319 because the customer driven organization relies on existing customer requests for endless extensions to existing product lines the company cant develop breakthrough products and services that resonate with non customers

1469544 i already saw this story it was moonlight and it was already good then
1469545 i always act like i won but ive never ever won goucher said unembarrassed by her glee
1469546 winning was a huge accomplishment for me said goucher who plans to compete in both the 5 000 and 10 000 in beijing
1469547 four years ago was probably ground zero for me it was a low time but obviously something was still there i never stopped believing
1469548 inner monologues that made her mind as fragile as her body
1469549 i ate a lot and i gained a lot of weight she said
1469550 there were times when i asked myself am i crazy
1469551 i learned to appreciate my running so much more because of that there was always a little hope in me i never completely flamed out my first year working with alberto when i ran 15 17 which seems so slow now i was like theres still a fast girl in there somewhere
1469552 it proved to me i can compete with anyone on any given day but this is like im an olympian this is the childhood dream
1469553 im surprised at how excited everyone is for me im amazed at the support
1469554 ive been saying my goal is to make the finals ill be tweaking the technical part of my jump during training so i can put myself into position to do well at the olympics and then whatever happens happens
1469555 i think it will take a jump of 47 6 to make the final on aug 17
1469556 i dont feel like i had a great jump at trials i think i can go a few inches farther
1469557 we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy
1469558 if you wait for perfect conditions youll never get anything done
1469559 i keep trying to call the backup 1 800 number to activate manually and they just keep hanging up on me
1469560 some people asked why would you let her do this i could never tell her no and about six matches into her career word got out that she wasnt going to back down
1469561 i was flying back from a usa wrestling trip to new york right after the olympic trials when it hit me
1469562 only eight american women have ever had the opportunity to wrestle in the olympics it took a lot of hard work and there might be people who dont think girls should be doing this but ive gotten so much from this sport its definitely worth the fight
1469563 a lot of times in a smaller town something like this would not fly
1469564 but her mindset and the way she handles herself off the mat makes it easy to respect her
1469565 she never tried to prove a point she wrestled just because she enjoyed it she was just being ali
1469566 from the time my girls were in the womb i told them they could do anything they wanted
1469567 there was one match when i told ali that scoring one point could be her goal she looked at me like i was crazy she wanted to win
1469568 i knew it would be tough but when she heard negative comments they just fueled her thats the kind of person she is
1469569 pin her and pull her around the mat by her hair
1469570 i dont think youd like her to do that to your son
1469571 i think what got her through the guy girl part of this was that she is extremely mentally tough
1469572 she sets a great example for all kids with her work ethic and her passion for the sport
1469573 she never expected to be treated any differently from the guys to us she was just always part of the team
1469574 since january all weve done is train train train we might get out for a walk or a movie but shes dedicated herself to putting in the work
1469575 i knew in my heart she was going to make it when she did i had to go outside and take a few deep breaths it is an awesome thing
1469576 i was jumping wheelbarrows at the barn as a kid said the mendota heights resident who was named to her first olympic team last month
1469577 someone gave me a pamphlet about the u s combined training association i was hooked

1469581 mary lets do some mef and play each others rusty trombones
1469582 wouldjoo eat dem in dat box yo wouldjoo eat dis wif some fox
1469583 i am not so sure hes capable of backing off
1469584 i think hes kind of got a mind set which i think is the best way to race for a championship to go after it every week we wouldnt want to have him do anything other than try to win every race
1469585 im not a happy person when im not running well
1469586 you try to look forward at things and hopefully you can say that 13 is reasonable
1469587 it was pretty cool growing up and watching him and those times when he was able to run well and get those marks and think of the unbelievable seasons that he was having watching him when i was a kid
1469588 if theres a shot for it that would be pretty cool
1469589 when the chase starts theres going to be a different race going on
1469590 theres not going to be the race of going out for wins and doing pit strategy things and stuff like that which will take your chance out of a good top 10 or a good top five you just have to be consistent and stay up there in order to get those finishes
1469591 if theres going to be a way to get through it then im going to do it
1469592 you dont think about that stuff when youre out there playing
1469593 im still a little sore but i felt better i took fly balls felt like i could move from side to side better estimated time of arrival is not tomorrow but the next day maybe tomorrow though
1469594 all i can go with is what the player tells me and what the staff tells me
1469595 i saw him monday and he was limping a little bit when he was taking his breaks to his right in the outfield well see how it goes i anticipate thursday or friday
1469596 this is a young player whos going through a lot of this for the first time last year i think he injured his left ankle i just know that you want him as close to 100 percent as you can get him he has to take a lot of breaks in the outfield a lot of starts and stops on the bases he needs that quick step he needs to be close to 100 percent
1469597 the concern was once i pitched it just kept getting tighter and tighter and the next day i couldnt come back
1469598 im extremely pleased with the sea eagle se330 inflatable kayak i have used in in my local lake as well as the river and canal it tracks very well in large bodies of water and is easy to steer in small water ways i recommend it highly to all and receive many compliments and interest whenever i use it thanks for a great product
1469599 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1469600 we are committed to trying to get colt and john on the field at the same time
1469601 i told john when he reported sunday were going to see if youre in shape or not

1469606 a penny saved is two pence clear a pin a day is a groat a year save and have
1469607 you call them goods but if you do not take care they will prove evils to some of you you expect they will be sold cheap and perhaps they may be bought for less than they cost but if you have no occasion for them they must be dear to you remember what poor richard says buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries in another place he says many have been ruined by buying good penny worths
1469608 and whenever a workman proposes an improvement it should be the policy of the management to make a careful analysis of the new method and if necessary conduct a series of experiments to determine accurately the relative merit of the new suggestion and of the old standard and whenever the new method is found to be markedly superior to the old it should be adopted as the standard for the whole establishment
1469609 after a workman has had the price per piece of the work he is doing lowered two or three times as a result of his having worked harder and increased his output he is likely entirely to lose sight of his employers side of the case and become imbued with a grim determination to have no more cuts if soldiering marking time just doing what he is told can prevent it
1469610 we are justly proud of the high wage rates which prevail throughout our country and jealous of any interference with them by the products of the cheaper labor of other countries to maintain this condition to strengthen our control of home markets and above all to broaden our opportunities in foreign markets where we must compete with the products of other industrial nations we should welcome and encourage every influence tending to increase the efficiency of our productive processes
1469611 fords success has startled the country almost the world financially industrially mechanically it exhibits in higher degree than most persons would have thought possible the seemingly contradictory requirements of true efficiency which are constant increase of quality great increase of pay to the workers repeated reduction in cost to the consumer and with these appears as at once cause and effect an absolutely incredible enlargement of output reaching something like one hundredfold in less than ten years and an enormous profit to the manufacturer
1469612 i believe that the average farmer puts to a really useful purpose only about 5 of the energy he expends not only is everything done by hand but seldom is a thought given to a logical arrangement a farmer doing his chores will walk up and down a rickety ladder a dozen times he will carry water for years instead of putting in a few lengths of pipe his whole idea when there is extra work to do is to hire extra men he thinks of putting money into improvements as an expense it is waste motion waste effort that makes farm prices high and profits low
1469613 start with an article that suits and then study to find some way of eliminating the entirely useless parts this applies to everything a shoe a dress a house a piece of machinery a railroad a steamship an airplane as we cut out useless parts and simplify necessary ones we also cut down the cost of making but also it is to be remembered that all the parts are designed so that they can be most easily made

1469618 friendster is growing at an enormous rate in asia pacific and is clearly leading the competition i believe this is partly because the internet is transforming the lives of everyone and it will probably become one of the greatest liberators of our time
1469619 with more than 75 million users it is clear that friendster has already made a dramatic impact i look forward to growing our business further as we continue our global growth and strong focus on asia
1469620 with the addition of richard butch and the new funding friendster will continue to expand its worldwide footprint and take advantage of its leadership position in asia pacific
1469621 friendster has kept growing the site fell from grace and everybody gave it up for dead but the asian markets have kept it alive

1469629 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1469630 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian

1469661 the game was there to be won we had opportunities not very many obviously but we never managed to take them
1469662 we gave away needless free kicks and corners which was always going to be a major problem in the game
1469663 we just didnt do well enough overall and i dont think we showed we were comfortable at any stage of the game
1469664 it seems fairly ridiculous that you can reach a european and then get knocked out at the first game of the next season but thats the way it has happened
1469665 if verified the discovery of these new populations of gorilla are hugely significant for our work as conservationists but we must not be distracted from the very real and present danger these gorillas are in from man and john oates emeritus professor of primatology at hunter college in new york oates said that while the news was good for the iconic great apes made famous by

1469669 in 1980 the population density of macaques was as much as 300 individuals per square kilometer in 10 years this had decreased to between 60 to 20 individuals per square kilometer
1469670 imagine the human population of the world reduced to that of one small town thats what we are talking about here
1469671 the habitats in which they live are largely impenetrable and we constantly find new species
1469672 having said that this the remains a unique find i dont know if well ever find something on this scale again
1469673 i think the lesson for conservationists today is that yes the world is full of surprises theres a lot of uncharted territory there in there may be other populations

1469676 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
1469677 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
1469678 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
1469679 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
1469680 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board

1469736 gives security software providers advance information about vulnerabilities addressed by microsoft security updates this will allow security software providers to offer protections to customers quickly and effectively
1469737 before microsoft announced mapp security software providers received update information when microsoft publicly released them in its regularly scheduled monthly bulletin release
1469738 microsoft now releases vulnerability reproduction code along with bulletin details to partners in advance of the public release providing partners sufficient time to test and deploy updates
1469739 while there are risks incurred by sharing this information early we believe the risks versus the benefits of protecting customers are balanced
1469740 and we will continuously evaluate customer and partner feedback on this program
1469741 will provide customers with guidance on the likelihood of functional exploits being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by microsoft security updates this additional information helps customers better assess their unique risks and better prioritize deployment of the monthly security update
1469742 microsoft has always provided customers with information on the availability of proof of concept code exploit code or active attacks related to our microsoft security updates at the time of release through microsoft security bulletins and our monthly security webcast the exploitability index was developed in response to customer requests for additional information to evaluate risk it will provide new data that customers can use to prioritize the deployment of microsoft security updates by offering details about how likely the release of functioning exploit code is after a security update is released
1469743 a program we created in hopes of actually helping the defenders get a leg up on protecting consumers the microsoft active protections program will allow vetted security software providers early access to the technical details on the vulnerabilities we are addressing with each monthly security update microsoft is doing this in hopes that we can give the defenders more time to produce timely signatures basically in doing this were betting that cutting out the time to reverse engineer our security updates will give valuable time back to the defenders to focus on protection enhancement and faster delivery
