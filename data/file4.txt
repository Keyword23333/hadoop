40019 i told myself that maybe he was making some kind of weird meta statement about how much first dates resemble job interviews so i just kissed his cheek and we went inside
40020 i told him i had gone to this todd p show at death by audio and he asked me who todd p was and then oh my god this is so bananas he told me he had gone to some murray hill bar with his old teammates from the middlebury lacrosse team thats when i knew this was never going to work

40045 hmmm didnt st reagan once give a big speech in germany in front of a historic symbol of german power with 20 000 germans in attendance
40046 these ss troops were the villains as we know that conducted the persecutions and all but there are 2 000 graves there and most of those the average age is about 18 i think that theres nothing wrong with visiting that cemetery where those young men are victims of nazism also even though they were fighting in the german uniform drafted into service to carry out the hateful wishes of the nazis they were victims just as surely as the victims in the concentration camps
40047 if your candidate is going to stage enormous rallies in front of tens of thousands of chanting germans with monuments to prussian military might in the background in the middle of his presidential campaign it isnt the gops fault if the footage comes out looking a little like hitler at nuremberg
40048 but you cant blame them for doing it cause its true
40049 wheres the outrage at perlstein for invoking triumph and obama in the same breath in the first place or is that okay because he lays this ravingly insane charge at the feet of republicans
40050 after all as moe no doubt sincerely believes republicans worhsip hitler why therefore would they want to identify obama with their hero
40051 i must admit the responses in the comments tend to confirm my suspicion that an obama presidency is going to be a long hard slog what with his worshipers patrolling the nets and the airwaves for any sign of racism or even worse in their minds lese majeste or sacrilege among the nations pundits satirists and comedians
40052 i must admit the responses in the comments tend to confirm my suspicion that an obama presidency is going to be a long hard slog what with his worshipers patrolling the nets and the airwaves for any sign of racism
40053 heres a tip for liberals if your candidate is going to stage enormous rallies in front of tens of thousands of chanting germans with monuments to prussian military might in the background in the middle of his presidential campaign it isnt the gops fault if the footage comes out looking a little like hitler at nuremberg
40054 it isnt the gops fault if the footage comes out looking a little like hitler at nuremberg
40055 i dont like obamas energy policy it doesnt address the needs of a growing economy
40056 but it is the gop who used the footage in an ad attacking obamas popularity and if youre conceding that the images are redolent of a nazi rally youre admitting that perlsteins right
40057 i actually wonder if the republicans had a crew on the scene to capture just the right angles for instance the identical camera placement shooting the speaker over the shoulder at stage right
40058 heres a tip for liberals if your candidate is going to stage enormous rallies in front of tens of thousands of chanting germans with monuments to prussian military might in the background in the middle of his presidential campaign it isnt the gops fault if the footage comes out looking a little like hitler at nuremberg
40059 i dont like obamas energy policy it doesnt address the needs of a growing economy
40060 so if im reading this correctly all you ross bashers agree with ricky perlstein that the rnc is trying to suggest that obama is out to rape your white daughters
40061 the obama supporters are a thin skinned lot like obama himself no humor allowed even the most absurd defenses of obamas behavior and choices are verboten to humor

40082 government is not reason it is not eloquent it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master

40101 good color and image quality good shutter response and more features than you can shake a stick at combine with typical iso noise performance to produce a camera that a full auto user can take up with confidence
40102 the image quality from this camera is terrific thats the main thing id like to point out but id still love to see a choice of shooting raw mode i loved the giant sized lcd finder that pivots out from the back of the camera and even with its quirks i liked the electronic view finder too
40103 overall the sony h50 is an average performer with good but not excellent image quality the build and screen are quite good but the interface and optical and sensor performance are not as good as they could be
40104 the fujifilm finepix z20fd is small and fun and offers good capability for its tiny size it picks up a lot of fine detail and both color and exposure performance are generally good noise handling isnt great at the highest sensitivity settings but results are fine at the normal isos

40110 i think tasmania could play an integral role in our national competition and theyve got a rich history of people they are very decent people they have served us very well with their relationship with hawthorn theyve invested very heavily in york park
40111 because there is no capacity among officials in ramallah to hold a dialogue due to the us and european veto
40112 openly interfering in issues affecting the essence of the internal palestinian position
40113 with a commander in his lions den and among his soldiers
40114 the supreme commander of the jihad and liberation front the pan arab secretary general of the baath arab socialist party and secretary of the iraq region
40115 al douri is believed to play an important role in financing
40116 though little is known about how directly he leads fighters on the ground
40117 one key aspect of the plot was to portray the demonstrating mobs against musaddiq which was a mercenary mob it had no ideology the mob was paid for by american dollars as supporters of the iranian communist party tudeh as in every other british and us military intervention until the collapse of the ussr the communist threat scenario was deployed as the official story the real threat of nationalism and dirtier aims like protecting oil profits were downplayed or removed from the picture presented to the public
40118 revolutionary organisation a brave and innovative leadership an armed revolutionary jihadist organisation it represents a fearless army and glorious armed forces
40119 i am in good health and at the height of the jihad spirit
40120 our resistance and battle with the us occupier is not new
40121 it started during the early years of the baath partys formation to expanded and deepen after the glorious tammuz july revolution of 1968 prior to 2003 the imperialist enemy used local forces from iraq and the arab nation sometimes other times it used regional powers to fight us on its behalf when its local and regional instruments failed to stop the pan arab renaissance march of iraq the us enemy directly entered the field of struggle and combat amassed great powers and led the invasion and occupation by itself
40122 the first chapter was the official showdown when the regular formations of the brave armed forces stood up to the us invasion then the launch of the popular confrontation against the invasion which intertwined with this chapter the popular official and military integration occurred immediately and the peoples war of liberation started during the first week of the invasion as was planned by the leadership and according to its strategy
40123 glorious women of iraq participated in the first formations of the popular resistance
40124 the first of which was the heroic operation carried out by two women in baghdad on the third day of the occupation another operation was carried out by a glorious iraqi woman in al nassiriyah south of iraq
40125 is sustaining the resistance and continuing the battle until the liberation of iraq
40126 so far the number of al baath martyrs in this battle amounts to 120 000
40127 fate and the responsibility of al baath as much as it is the responsibility of the great people of iraq and its jihadist national pan arab and islamic powers and the free people of our arab nation and humanity as a whole
40128 has destroyed the alliance of evil the parties of which are escaping one after another only us president george w bush remains blundering in his debacle
40129 as the saying goes you cannot reach at the negotiating table farther than your artillery can reach
40130 friends and foes are very well aware of our strategy programme of resistance and liberation which was made public via the media the baath party doesnt negotiate with anybody at all if they dont recognise this strategy beforehand and will negotiate neither with america nor with intermediaries or friends except on this basis if the enemy recognises this strategy we will sit with them directly negotiate with them and help them exit our country without losing face and will facilitate their exit prior to this recognition there are no negotiations with the occupying enemy
40131 the baath party will meet with whoever it decides to meet except with the zionist entity israel and the government of collaborators in the green zone we will be happy when the enemy is convinced of its defeat accepts our strategy sits with us to negotiate a programme for its implementation
40132 any negotiations with the invaders without it represents a desertion and treason and is refused by all national pan arab and islamic factions of the resistance
40133 appear quickly behind in front and on the sides of the enemy as dictated by the nature of the place time climate of the operation and the type and nature of the target then hit quickly and disappear quickly before the enemy has time to react
40134 in planning implementing and selecting the target take care to secure a kill in the enemy
40135 your weapon is your life so take care to keep it always ready and away from the eyes of the enemy and its spies
40136 protect the security of information as a red line or a holy matter
40137 the enemy is blind without spies so exert all efforts to disclose and liquidate them
40138 noting that the enemy is hunting you at all times so keep discreet disguised and vigilant
40139 inflict the biggest losses in the ranks of the enemy and decrease to the minimum your own losses
40140 make your hands heavy on the enemy during their rest hours
40141 concentrate on the enemys bases camps and headquarters day and night
40142 take your time to deal with extreme accuracy with traitors and spies to avoid hurting innocents
40143 expand the circle of monitoring following up and hunting the enemy so it doesnt surprise us
40144 sustain your traditional ties with your relatives neighbours neighbourhood and friends and make these ties deeper and more intimate but dont make any of them feel you have a mission they dont understand
40145 help them to overcome the details of daily life hardships which are so many nowadays
40146 fight for the sake of god the enemies of god until the tyrant invaders are defeated until the clear cut victory the liberation of the homeland and raising the flag of there is no god but the god and bringing back the flag of god is the greatest to fly in iraq skies
40147 we consider that there is a very real danger that the jury became confused and that the prosecution have rightly conceded that this conviction is unsafe
40148 the result is that some of the 21 documents we relied on
40149 ms malik was not prosecuted for her poetry she was prosecuted for possessing documents that could provide practical assistance to terrorists
40150 the jury was required to consider not only documents which
40151 we consider that there was scope for the jury to have become confused
40152 the yemeni initiative brings to mind the cairo declaration of march 2005 and the programme and the national conciliation document of june 2006
40153 hamas refused to talk to certain plo factions concerning the more recent yemeni initiative hamas also declined to fully accept the yemeni initiative and insisted instead on reducing it to bilateral discussions between fatah and hamas
40154 the dissolution of a bipolar world and the break up of the soviet union led to the eradication of the forces of the left progressive and democratic forces in the middle east
40155 it is about time that we in the arab world and beyond understand more fully this reality
40156 the goal is to solve the current state of palestinian division through a comprehensive national dialogue that preserves unity
40157 the arab summit was a sad scene it was a reflection of the arab realities
40158 the lebanese crisis is a microcosm of what is going on in the wider arab world
40159 the rupture between hamas and fatah is yet another example of the splits and spats within the arab world
40160 there is a need for solidarity between arab countries in order for us to resolve the recurrent calamities
40161 the arab crises continue to fester we cannot find solutions to these problems the resolutions are meaningless we the palestinian people are especially heartbroken by this trend because it is we who will be most affected we more than any other arab people bear the brunt of arab disunity
40162 there is a new optimism in the air in many asian countries in latin america and africa south of the sahara it is about time that we in the arab world catch up with them
40163 under no conditions should we minimize these developments which could have such tragic ends
40164 national resistance is the only option for iraqis for expelling the occupation and its agents
40165 the founder of the amariya baghdad awakening says the americans have cut him loose and the iraqi government is pursuing him
40166 this is not the way i should have been treated it is hurtful to see myself being treated this way in a country i love would protect and where ive done everything i can to engage with and be a good citizen
40167 its a very very worrying trend that needs to be opposed this mindset that views everything with extreme suspicion that installs some sort of play it safe mentality which is the very opposite of intellectual endeavour
40168 no intellectual progress takes place without a sense of curiosity without a sense of going beyond what we know already beyond the established facts and notions and truths thats how scientific and intellectual revolutions have been achieved
40169 someone could be forgiven in this current climate for panicking at this type of document but i would have appreciated had i been given five minutes simply to answer the questions relevant to the document once the procedure was launched it was quickly out of the universitys hands
40170 people are more suspicious of colleagues and students people are scared even to look at the link for the training manual in the nottingham case
40171 what worries me is this self censorship and gradual erosion of our academic freedom and before we know it we will be self censoring and will not be able to change it
40172 hicham was a very prominent member of student political society that says something about the potential implications of being politically active on campus in a time when a culture of fear merges with draconian terror legislation
40173 its a question of intellectual freedom not just academic freedom what does this say about peoples right to inform themselves about issues of public concern
40174 once again the insistence of the western states and the us in particular in provoking the feelings of the arabs and muslims and continuing to adopt wrong policies which led to the current state of bloody chaos in the middle east blair whom president georges bush wanted to reward for blindly following his administration completely lost his credibility and is considered the most hated person by arabs and muslims after president bush
40175 theres nothing to say to al qaida and theyve got nothing to say to us at the moment but at some stage youre going to have to come to a political solution as well as a security solution and that means you need the ability to talk
40176 the sad truth is that fahrenheit 9 11 is a bad movie but not for the reasons it is being attacked in the dominant culture its at times a racist movie and the analysis that underlies the films main political points is either dangerously incomplete or virtually incoherent
40177 since the end of wwii there has been bipartisan support for us attempts to dominate the politics of the middle east republican and democratic administrations alike have pursued illegal and immoral policies using overt and covert violence this didnt start with george w bush and wont end when hes out of office moores movie failed to offer any coherent analysis of the historical and political context for bushs failed wars and hence did little to help viewers deepen their understanding
40178 when the humanitarian perspective becomes a cover for humanizing the invader in iraq or palestine independently of politics it changes into an arrogant orientalist mechanism of reducing the arab cause to a form of shallow humanitarian advocacy at best and political misguidance based on conflation of henchman and victim at worst undeniably the movies message is tricky it is in an effort to exonerate the marines in iraq and the non ideological resistance present the residents as aimless barn animals ready for slaughter and to indict major politicians in the west and ideologists in the east ultimately it is a liberal message and stems from lack of comprehension of the ongoing battle between the occupation and the resistance on iraqs soil
40179 it encourages the viewer to engage with our shared humanity a humanity too often denied to these victims
40180 he kosminsky replied that it was to make people ask more questions about internal and foreign policy about spooks as well as suicide bombers indeed it was to boldly ask the question whether the effects of personal trauma in this case nasimas best friend who is detained without trial and then subjected to a control order coupled with societal hostility and a sense of political impotence can lead someone to the path of violent extremism and if it can are we able to understand
40181 i think the film allows the audience to rethink and re humanise the resistance faction of the iraqi political scene and shows them to be people whose aspirations are not so dissimilar from our own denying a view of iraqis as actors in their own history then perpetuates the notion that we westerners are the only ones civilized and sophisticated enough to provide a solution instead of facing the reality that we are actually the major problem in iraq unfortunately most western filmmakers or journalists who have tackled iraq simply havent been sufficiently self aware to look at themselves and the subject in this way
40182 at least four tomahawk cruise missiles fired from a navy ship or submarine off the somali coast had slammed into a small compound of single story buildings in dusa marreb
40183 american military official in washington who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the operation
40184 the u s says al shabab is part of the al qaeda network although correspondents say it is impossible to accurately establish those links

40189 for graham to walk into the club it was overwhelming for the players its just terrific to see graham back
40190 we know hes got an enormous amount of work in his recovery but its just fantastic to see him about the club
40191 is that a naive statement i dont think it is it is the reality of what
40192 if somebody can show me any terrorism campaign where it has been policed out id be happy to read about it because i cant think of one
40193 if you look at some of the biggest risks my people have taken it is talking to people who historically they would not have dreamed of talking to were we going to actually police our way out of the troubles no are we actually going to police our way out of the current threat no
40194 did i think in 1977 when i joined the met i would end up talking to gerry adams in 2004 and bear in mind the campaign was in london absolutely unthinkable
40195 well thats the logic of i dont think thats unthinkable the question will be one of timing
40196 it got to a point where those combatants realised certainly on the republican side it wasnt ever going to work so theres a certain pragmatism in there the question does bin laden see it that way probably not if you dont ask you dont know
40197 a cornered animal lashes out and these people are cornered they are not wanted by their community theyve got nowhere to go
40198 if you dont like the heat dont get in the kitchen
40199 i think that people that put themselves up have sufficient confidence in their ability and sufficient confidence in their vision for policing not to be too intimidated by the more ridiculous assertions of some of the press if you take the press personally youre dead
40200 do the public seriously want amateurs playing in this world
40201 i was lucky because god allowed that i be released
40202 im very happy to be in sudan but im very sad because of the situation of our brothers who remain in guantanamo conditions in guantanamo are very very bad and they get worse by the day
40203 our human condition our human dignity was violated and the
40204 in guantanamo rats are treated with more humanity but we have
40205 and they will not give them the rights that they give animals

40209 wants to flush as many men out of guantanamo as quickly as possible as guantanamo has become such an international badge of shame
40210 once the supreme court said the men could have lawyers the pressure increased on the us and condemnation isolated the us administration guantanamo was a pr disaster
40211 ive met many prisoners gotten to appreciate their suffering we
40212 ive been to guantanamo and the human dimension of guantanamo is a story yet to be told
40213 we are concerned about the way the americans dealt with sami and we are concerned about the way they could deal with others as well
40214 sami will continue with al jazeera he will continue as a
40215 we congratulate his family and all those who knew sami and loved sami and worked for this moment
40216 there is no doubt that many sexual atrocities were committed by the attacking jews many young arab girls were raped and later slaughtered old women were also molested
40217 barra irresistibile forse in onore a john curtis estes p come al solito non a tutti piaciuta
40218 this does not deter us from continuing our holy war against allahs enemy we will be on the right way that is why we are targeted
40219 we are capable of holding the areas we capture but we always want fewer losses we want no harm to come to the civilian population until people become independent the fighting will not stop

40222 addouri is believed to play an important role in financing
40223 though little is known about how directly he leads fighters on the ground
40224 one key aspect of the plot was to portray the demonstrating mobs against musaddiq which was a mercenary mob it had no ideology the mob was paid for by american dollars as supporters of the iranian communist party tudeh as in every other british and us military intervention until the collapse of the ussr the communist threat scenario was deployed as the official story the real threat of nationalism and dirtier aims like protecting oil profits were downplayed or removed from the picture presented to the public
40225 revolutionary organization a brave and innovative leadership an armed revolutionary jihadist organization it represents a fearless army and glorious armed forces
40226 i am in good health and at the height of the jihad spirit
40227 today i believe i am immigrating to god and his prophet
40228 left the world myself and its fortunes behind my back
40229 our resistance and battle with the u s occupier is not new
40230 it started during the early years of al baath formation to expand and deepen after the glorious tammuz july revolution of 1968 prior to 2003 the imperialist enemy used local forces from iraq and the arab nation sometimes other times it used regional powers to fight us on its behalf when its local and regional instruments failed to stop the pan arab renaissance march of iraq the u s enemy directly entered the field of struggle and combat amassed great powers and led the invasion and occupation by itself
40231 the first chapter was the official showdown when the regular formations of the brave armed forces stood up to the u s invasion then the launch of the popular confrontation against the invasion which inter wined with this chapter the popular official and military integration occurred immediately and the peoples war of liberation started during the first week of the invasion as was planned by the leadership and according to its strategy
40232 glorious women of iraq participated in the first formations of the popular resistance
40233 martyrdom operations the first of which was the heroic operation carried out by two women in baghdad on the third day of the occupation another operation was carried out by a glorious iraqi woman in al nassiriyah south of iraq
40234 third chapter is sustaining the resistance and continuing the battle until the liberation of iraq
40235 so far the number of al baath martyrs in this battle amounts to one hundred and twenty thousand
40236 fate and the responsibility of al baath as much as it is the responsibility of the great people of iraq and its jihadist national pan arab and islamic powers and the free people of our arab nation and humanity as a whole
40237 has destroyed the alliance of evil the parties of which are escaping one after another only u s president george w bush remains blundering in his debacle
40238 as the saying goes you cannot reach at the negotiating table farther than your artillery can reach
40239 al baath doesnt negotiate with anybody at all if they dont recognize this strategy beforehand and will negotiate neither with america nor with intermediaries or friends except on this basis if the enemy recognized this strategy we will sit with them directly negotiate with them and help them exit our country without loosing face and will facilitate their exit prior to this recognition there are no negotiations with the occupying enemy
40240 al baath will meet with whoever it decides to meet except with the zionist entity israel and the government of collaborators in the green zone we will be happy when the enemy is convinced of its defeat accepts our strategy sits with us to negotiate a program for its implementation
40241 any negotiations with the invaders without it represents a desertion and treason and is refused by all national pan arab and islamic factions of the resistance
40242 appear quickly behind in front and on the sides of the enemy as dictated by the nature of the place time climate of the operation and the type and nature of the target then hit quickly and disappear quickly before the enemy could have time to react
40243 in planning implementing and selecting of the target take care to hit a kill in the enemy
40244 your weapon is your life so take care to keep it always ready and away from the eyes of the enemy and its spies
40245 protect the security of information as a red line or a holy matter
40246 the enemy is blind without spies so exert all efforts to disclose and liquidate them
40247 noting that the enemy is hunting you at all times so keep discreet disguised and vigilant
40248 inflict the biggest losses in the ranks of the enemy and decrease to the minimum your own losses
40249 make your hands heavy at the enemy during their rest hours
40250 concentrate on the enemys bases camps and headquarters day and night
40251 take your time to deal with high extreme accuracy with the traitors and spies to avoid hurting innocents
40252 expand the circle of monitoring following up and hunting the enemy so it doesnt surprise us
40253 sustain your traditional ties with your relatives neighbors neighborhood and friends and make these ties deeper and more intimate but dont make any of them feel you have a mission they dont understand
40254 help them to overcome the details of daily life hardships which are so many nowadays
40255 fight for the sake of god the enemies of god until the tyrant invaders are defeated until the clear cut victory the liberation of the homeland and raising the flag of there is no god but the god and bringing back the flag of god is the greatest to fly in iraq skies
40256 al baath arab socialist party is the party of iraq and the arab nation it did not lay arms or stop fighting even for an hour during day and night and its jihadist march did not stop any time it wasnt surprised by what happened but increased its determination not to be exhausted to relentlessly fight the invaders their stooges and spies whatever the sacrifices are and regardless of how long it would take until full victory and the liberation of iraq
40257 a heroic and decisive role in the march of the resistance in addition to their jihadist fighting role through their own formations under the flag of the general command of the armed forces they are in accordance with the guidance of the party al baath leadership and the general command of the armed forces dispersed into other jihad factions where they act as field commanders planners technicians makers and developers of most of the various weapons of the resistance they represent the soul of the resistance and the secret of its innovations accurate performance and victories
40258 the resistance depended on the rules and principles of peoples wars and the guerrilla war after developing its fighting methods and tactics and was innovative in its logistic and special operations more important it has adapted the iraqi environment to serve the peoples war through practice it has developed
40259 all the land is ours and all the time is ours
40260 we have made and innovated new ways and methods unprecedented in the peoples wars of liberation or even in the intelligence sciences i cannot go into more details for security reasons this is what kept the resistance
40261 the party al baath is more than half a century old in iraq the organization of al baath today is stronger many times than it was before the occupation i will not elaborate for reasons al baath will speak out on time
40262 thousands joined the party mostly young people aged between 16 and 25 tens of thousands of other iraqis joined the resistance factions led by al baath
40263 in the end the national pan arab and islamic front emerged al baath is one of its basic pillars
40264 our resistance not only has no incubator outside the borders of its country but what is worse and more bitter is that 99 percent of the influential world powers are either directly involved with the enemy against it or sympathize with the enemy the one percent which sympathizes with the resistance turned its back to it fearing its enemies but god provided for it and made it in no need for them the people of iraq have provided their money and offspring it is an inexhaustible source
40265 the occupying enemy and its regional and local partners have launched a genocide against the baathists their families supporters and sympathizers the collaborators constitution which was prepared by the cia includes a nazi racist article stipulating the liquidation of al baath as an organization thought and persons
40266 they targeted by physical liquidation destruction and displacement the society of the party to the sixth neighbor
40267 one of the most important and dangerous debaathization methods after assassinations and physical liquidation of baathists is the attempt to completely censor the role of al baath on the field as a resisting party and an armed resistance and to smear it image and role
40268 had al baath not been the initiator of resistance since the first day of the invasion and occupation and had it not acted as if the battle is its own and the cause is its own cause the world could not have seen the emergence of the strongest national resistance immediately following the invasion
40269 the other jihad factions emerged after the resistance was deeply rooted in confronting the occupier and undermining its strategy some of them were formed and started to act three years after the occupation
40270 wide and strong base of jihad today is the resistance of al baath and the national pan arab and islamic forces with those members of the higher command of jihad and liberation in the forefront who cover the whole area of iraq
40271 dont you see how the invaders collaborators traitors spies renegades despite their differences on many other things have agreed to censor its role and action and instead inflated the claim that it the resistance is terrorism
40272 i have documented over the past five years on cds thousands of operations against the enemy while the enemy is highlighting the role of other groups some of which was directly formed or via intermediaries by the occupation itself and some other were formed by foreign powers hostile to iraq who kill the people on id
40273 no truce with those and well resist whatever entity is established under occupation and in its service first among them the traitors government in the green zone
40274 jihad and liberation front for armed factions 33 armed resistance factions according to him on the field in september 2007 both fronts are open to all anti occupation armed and political forces
40275 al baath deeply and principally believes in the creation of a pluralistic national democratic system in which power is democratically rotated on the basis of ballot boxes through free transparent and fair elections
40276 we are confident that our kurdish people will not get their national and cultural rights except within the unity of a free liberated independent and prosperous iraq al baath party will remain committed to the historical march 1970 statement and the 1974 law of autonomy as the basis for dealing with the national cultural and political rights of our kurdish people in iraq
40277 the birth of both parties will contribute to strengthening and expanding the kurdish national movement against the occupation and its stooges
40278 taken in by the stereotypical image of islam he portray
40279 we believe in it all of it comes from our lord
40280 this means that it will be a criminal offence to belong to fundraise and encourage support for the military wing of the organisation
40281 i consider it a natural decision to be issued by a founding bloc of the zionist entity
40282 every time a decision is issued against resistance movements we consider this a medal of honour
40283 hezbollahs military wing is providing active support to militants in iraq who are responsible for attacks both on coalition forces and on iraqi civilians including providing training in the use of deadly roadside bombs
40284 hezbollahs military wing also provides support to palestinian terrorist groups in the occupied palestinian territories such as palestinian islamic jihad it is because of this support for terrorism in iraq and occupied palestinian territories that the government has taken this action
40285 the suggestion is the iranians are using hezbollah as sub contractors in iraq
40286 unacceptable and offensive to allah it is in fact one of the

40345 everyone was disappointed with the outcome of berlin raceway last weekend because we thought we really had a chance to end up in victory lane but it wasnt meant to be we just want to thank boatwerks waterfront restaurant for coming onboard and hope we can make the finish up to them in another race
40346 i have a good feeling about this weekend hopefully i am right we had a good strong car here in the spring but got sidelined with engine failure i think well have a better motor this weekend and hopefully we can put our season back on track with a good run saturday afternoon
40347 really is unfortunate i feel this is one of the best races of the year and for there to be zero television coverage will hurt everyone across the board thankfully arca is stepping in and doing the best they can with the radio broadcast but still has the same ill effects for the viewers who cant log on well be back to television coverage next weekend at nashville and that will be a bright spot for everyone
40348 man i had a blast it was extremely beneficial to me and i know that the experience will pay off when we go to new jersey motorsports park in september im looking forward to doing the other school before hammering down for the real thing a week later
40349 we had a very good car at berlin and just continued to have crappy luck hopefully that was our last bad race of the season we have some really good race tracks coming up and we look to make some noise there
40350 pocono is a very demanding track patrick has had some ups and downs there but we are confident we can bounce back from our performance there in june and have a good afternoon there will be some stiff competition there but we are ready for anything that is presented to us look for our camouflage no 60 dodge charger up front

40361 the top fuel dragsters get top billing so i went that route
40362 but from a business standpoint doing things like meeting with sponsors and fans driving one car was a decision i had to make
40363 you actually only have both hands on the steering wheel for about 1 5 seconds
40364 driving the dragster is much more about finesse youre doing around 275 to 285 miles per hour about halfway down and by the time you cross the finish line youre around 320 to 330
40365 theres a tremendous amount of speed and a lot of g force and theres no gears to shift all you have to do is drive

40379 the red sox did the same with guys like nomar garciaparra and pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy
40380 i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here

40393 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
40394 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
40395 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
40396 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something

40462 suatu kali saya berdoa ya allah jadikan saya isteri yang selalu terlihat cantik di mata suami
40463 ya memang bagus pak herman tetapi esok harinya wajah saya mulai ditumbuhi jerawat yang saya tidak tahu darimana datangnya banyak beberapa hari kemudian malah memenuhi seluruh wajah saya jadi kebingungan akhirnya mau tidak mau saya harus menjalani perawatan kecantikan wajah ke sebuah salon kecantikan suatu hal yang tidak pernah saya lakukan saya harus datang ke tempat itu untuk membersihkan jerawat di muka saya berkali kali berhari hari hasilnya tentu saja mengejutkan saya wajah saya menjadi lebih bersih dari semula lebih cantik

40468 apakah tuhan memberikan apa yang engkau harap dengan mengantarkannya dalam bungkusan yang indah
40469 tuhan tidak mengantarkan apa yang engkau minta dalam sebuah bungkusan yang menarik lagi indah bahkan ia mengantarkannya dalam bungkusan yang jelek ruwet carut marut dan kelihatannya sukar untuk dibuka pertanyaannya adalah mengapa
40470 itu tidak lain karena ia ingin melihat bagaimana engkau membuka bungkusan itu dengan penuh kesabaran telaten bersusah payah lapis demi lapis sedikit demi sedikit terus terus dan terus tak pernah berhenti apalagi berpaling hingga pada akhirnya bungkus terakhir terbuka dan engkau mendapatkan sesuatu yang engkau harapkan ada di dalamnya
40471 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god
40472 all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made
40473 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him
40474 in him we live and move and have our being
40475 men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil john 3 19 note 2 corinthians 4 6 genesis 1 3 henry morris
40476 and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved
40477 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise the became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their bodies between themselves
40478 and god said let there by light and there was light
40479 for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ

40481 but it seems to me theyre not off the mark at all and compared to the hate speech so easily and routinely heard on clearchannel programs the columnists comments are pretty mild
40482 not everyone who thinks the way jim adkisson did will open fire on a group of people

40502 dr simon j carmels book is not only a great historical resource but also it illustrates many personal struggles and triumphs as well these men and women all shared two very strong common interests they are or were all deaf and they all have or had a love for the art of magic i learned much after reading each story for instance i never knew okito was deaf and that was the reason he created a silent act to music i applaud dr carmel for all the inspiration and years of effort in creating this important work
40503 i tell you the truth this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others they all gave out of their wealth but she out of her poverty put in everything all she had to live on
40504 we are excited about the launch of the ex z75 zoom the new high quality high performance edition to exilim line

40508 during the first four weeks of pregnancy taking a folic acid supplement 400 micrograms per day can help prevent neural tube defects in the foetus such as
40509 so therefore in the world of journalists red wine prevents breast cancer in people
40510 each additional 10g ethanol day was associated with risk higher by 10
40511 the association between alcohol and breast cancer may be causal
40512 the journalists suggest red wine could prevent breast cancer in people
40513 if the casual reader knows no better and assumes that an article in their favourite daily newspaper will accurately reflect the science then how are they to blame if the article is in fact completely inaccurate
40514 do you not think in this case the journalist should take responsibility for what they have written
40515 this is not a case of readers assuming that red wine could prevent cancer means red wine will prevent cancer it is a case of a journalist misleading their readership by writing a story they should damn well know is wrong because they wrote about a study that showed their story to be wrong
40516 im sure i cant be the only one whose decisions are being influenced like this
40517 people read newspapers despite everything we think we know their contents seep in we believe them to be true and we act upon them
40518 theres no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of native americans as well as other persons of color in this country weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for
40519 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
40520 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
40521 the biggest problem that we have in terms of race relations i think is dealing with the legacy of past discrimination which has resulted in extreme disparities in terms of poverty in terms of wealth and in terms of income our inner cities are a legacy of what happened in the past and the question is less assigning blame or rooting out active racism because thats not the reason that those inner cities are in such bad shape but rather figuring out are we willing to make the investments to deal with that past history so we can move forward to a brighter future and that involves investing in early childhood education fixing the schools in those communities being willing to work in terms of job retraining and those are serious investments
40522 is serious investments code for reparations and how expensive and devastating would obamas income redistribution policy be
40523 fundamental injustice cruelty brutality and inhumanity of slavery and jim crow
40524 does barack obama believe its time for america to apologize to al qaida
40525 the push has begun among obamas fellow liberals for reparations to osama bin ladens al qaida warriors
40526 in wonderfully liberal style that is beyond parody rutten uses a book review to endorse the idea of paying money to osamas fighters who in the eyes of liberals have been denied their right of habeas corpus at guantanamo
40527 the liberals on the court with the mind boggling addition of reagan appointee anthony kennedy held that contrary to bush administration and congressional policy not to mention all of american history the prisoners of war or detainees picked up off the battlefields in this case afghanistan and iraq are in fact entitled to the same constitutional rights as american citizens
40528 lobbying not simply for habeas corpus rights for al qaida but reparations as well
40529 in other words if you have been captured on the field of battle fighting the u s military on behalf of the global jihad and as a result are now on an extended stay at gitmo liberals feel the appropriate policy of the united states government is to 1 apologize for capturing you and 2 pay you some cold american cash to ease your pain and humiliation
40530 we still gave them a day in court and that taught the entire world about who we are but also the basic principles of rule of law
40531 if americas only problem was with a sum total of about 1 800 german soldiers why all that disturbing fuss known as world war ii
40532 stashed in 511 internment camps sprinkled all around the good old usa from north carolina to iowa to california
40533 not a single one of these men were given their habeas corpus rights they were not tried not one they were held as prisoners forced to do whatever labor their american captors thought suitable until america had won the war
40534 will obama have the courage to follow the arguments to their logical conclusions if the idea is to have american taxpayers fork over damages to osamas men why not hitlers where are the trial lawyers who have been flocking to guantanamo the size of the damage pot in a suit against the u s government for the treatment of nazis would one suspects be considerable
40535 crowddna are a perfect client for us they want a very tailored and reactive service for their busy online projects to be able deliver the sort of results their clients demand

40537 im not that concerned about having every detail of his life exposed to me i think kids have to be kids and have some freedom
40538 i think parents have a right to and they should be checking on who their kids are talking to and what theyre saying and what kind of pictures theyre sending
40539 part of the reason for the resolution is its very hard for people in managed care residences like assisted living facilities to get out and go to register to vote
40540 we should be making every effort to make it as easy as possible for them to vote
40541 we dont just willy nilly say today would be a good day to go the library and register people you have to do it in conjunction with a sponsored event
40542 voter registration is a popular topic nationally because in most states if you dont register way ahead of time you cant vote casting the vote is what is important registration without voting is of little value

40548 in 1908 the civic league of st louis conducted a study of a slum neighborhood known as carr square one area contained as many as 1900 residents per acre the average living space was 16 9 square feet per person there was an average of one bathtub and four toilets for 2479 people the average rent was 1 a week human waste and garbage accumulated in the few open spaces and in these ill ventilated foul smelling shacks and cellars were found saloons bakeries groceterias and laundries

40551 make no mistake about it the latino community holds this election in its hands
40552 some of the closest contests this november are going to be in states like florida colorado nevada and new mexico states with large latino populations
40553 if you have any doubt about whether you can make a difference just remember how back in 2004 40 000 registered latino voters in new mexico didnt turn out on election day
40554 lost that state by fewer than 6 000 votes 6 000 votes
40555 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
40556 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
40557 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
40558 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
40559 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
40560 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
40561 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
40562 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
40563 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
40564 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
40565 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
40566 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
40567 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
40568 im receiving the benefits the system is broken and unfortunately my children and grandchildren according to the trustees of the social security system will not have the same benefits the present retirees have

40573 think im exaggerating wait until i show you the monster that kills you by becoming your pants and tricking you into putting them on
40574 he was moving through life and maybe not real appreciative of things
40575 when this happened it totally spun him in a 180 its the best thing that ever happened to him im not saying its a good thing but it happened for a reason
40576 this is what wyoming stands for thats why weve got the overwhelming majority in the state legislature people believe in those republican principles and thats why we elect the people that we do
40577 i understand why the republicans want to continue thinking that this is a republican state and republicans are just going to win because thats the way its always been
40578 but we have outstanding candidates this year up and down the ballot

40629 we decided in 1994 that the time was right for a national day for kids
40630 we went to congress and they recognized it what we wanted to do is not create a day that was just an empty celebration we wanted to create something that had meaning
40631 weve been working with kids for more than a century so many kids have come to us in crisis for one reason or another but the common denominator is that lots of parents were not spending meaningful time with their kids we thought it was time to bring this to national attention and what a better way than create a day that encourages parents to spend meaningful time with their children
40632 the worlds first university to produce plant based vaccines and biopharmaceuticals

40636 pasteurization makes it sterile but does not ruin the good stuff
40637 dayton childrens hospital volunteered to be a drop off site for donors they even raised the money for their own freezer
40638 early on many people expressed disbelief about my decision to donate our milk concerned that pumping would be incredibly emotionally painful for me
40639 donating our milk helped me to prove that aiden was not an accident that it wasnt a mistake he was conceived and born it allowed him to live on and help so many other babies who were fortunate enough to survive but were in need of our help
40640 it was the last direct link to my pregnancy experience i saw it somehow as an extension of my son as long as i was still pumping then aiden was in some way still living on
40641 pumping our breast milk for donation actually ended up being very emotionally healing for me i cant imagine not having the opportunity to do that i was doing good in aidens name
40642 its a joy its so touching to have so many people help these little babies
40643 i thought some good things happened and some things we have to correct but i felt for the most part for our young guys it was a good opportunity to see a different colored jersey and a different player
40644 i thought both teams did a good job of keeping their composure and treating it like a professional practice we got something out of it and talking to minnesota coach brad childress he felt he got something out of it
40645 couple of nicks donnie edwards with a hamstring kolby smith with a groin branden albert with an ankle
40646 no no a hamstring is a hamstring and that could linger on the ankle hell be fine nothing bad
40647 i thought for the most part once we got going both teams were very competitive they were both trying to be physical its hard to tell just looking at plays until you watch the tape watch everybody there will be some things that will make you shake your head and say why did we do that
40648 but youth will be served and theyre going to make some errors
40649 thought we threw the ball halfway decent too on seven on seven
40650 it was our guys that needed to practice against another team theyve got some veteran guys and thats a long ride those guys are veteran players so i could see what they did
40651 yeah he ran good he ran hard he got hit some but hes been getting hit some in practice too he wanted that he wanted to get hit and wanted to find a tempo
40652 yeah he laid a good one on him i didnt blow the whistle fast enough and the poor guy got it
40653 yeah but minnesota did some things early on nine on seven and they were very good against the run
40654 we got something out of it we just needed to practice against another team thats good for us we had a lot of guys on the field tonight that had never been in action against another team in a professional uniform jamaal charles was so excited he couldnt keep his feet he wants to hit the hole so fast hes tripping over his own feet this was good work for us
40655 well see some things on the tape and say why did we do that
40656 youth is going to be served and they are going to make some errors

40659 she brainstormed with a couple of influential people and everyone gave her a thumbs up for the idea for now she wants to begin the school in india and over time in other countries
40660 in fact bebo even got saif to start practising power yoga after all she attributes her hot bod to it

40680 ive heard the whole week is extremely long youve got dinners every night not little dinners but huge massive dinners i know as players thats the last thing we want to do
40681 i assured him that my comments had nothing to do with my desire to make the team
40682 i think he was understanding of what i was trying to say i wasnt misquoted but it was kind of the wrong context he understands how hard i want to make the team
40683 how would he know hes had to hear it from probably everybody whos ever played on both teams
40684 im sure we talked about it last year at the presidents cup
40685 if thats all you hear sometimes perception becomes reality but thats a mistake on our part if thats what were letting become reality
40686 if thats what i have to do to be on the team ill be in a black tie every night
40687 both teams do the same thing it doesnt matter if you run a marathon every night
40688 whether both teams are doing nothing or both teams are doing a lot i dont think it has any effect on the outcome

40696 you can take your diploma walk off this stage and chase only after the big house and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should
40697 fulfilling your immediate wants and needs betrays a poverty of ambition

40702 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
40703 people of all ages stations and skills will be asked to serve
40704 the future of our nation depends on the soldier at fort carson
40705 but it also depends on the teacher in east l a the nurse in appalachia the after school worker in new orleans

40714 islam isnt in america to be equal to any other faiths but to become dominant the koran the muslim book of scripture should be the highest authority in america and islam the only accepted religion on earth
40715 we are not fighting so that you will offer us something we are fighting to eliminate you
40716 first chase out the invaders from our territory in palestine in iraq and everywhere in islamic land
40717 second instal sharia islamic law on the entire earth and spread islamic justice there the attacks will not cease until after the victory of islam and the setting up of sharia

40730 jaja diese verkehrss nder mein b si ist letzthin auch von so einem raser berfahren worden
40731 das ist ja allerhand mit rasen beginnt es aber jetzt noch mit einer gef lschten tausendernote bezahlen zu wollen warten sie hier ich ruf die polizei
40732 all of that is due to the above normal precipitation we had in the last year
40733 it just seemed like the right thing to do were always looking to be stewards to the land
40734 theres a lot of things we are doing that are environmentally friendly
40735 weve been working a little bit at a time on our checklist
40736 its not a lot of major things its a lot of little things put together
40737 any course can save money and still have the aesthetic quality that is necessary its certainly a benefit for everyone
40738 instead of having the opportunity of removing what might have been there they have to treat the whole pile as if its all asbestos
40739 theyve done some draft permit conditions but nothing thats really ready for the general review yet
40740 shes under my bed i got some cheese cause i know she likes it but damn i am not getting to sleep till late
40741 change your hearts and lives because the kingdom of heaven is coming soon
40742 this is a voice of a man who calls out in the desert prepare the way for the lord make the road straight for him
40743 her body felt like itd been beaten with a hose this must be what it felt like to get old it wasnt that your body fell apart from living so long it was that you had to take so many stompings from life that youd be happy when the time came to close your eyes and never open them again
40744 weve now touched it and tasted it and id like to say that it tastes very fine
40745 there were a lot of champagne corks popping in the downlink room last night

40748 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well
40749 if you wouldnt mind may i ask what the reason for this cancellation is
40750 street lights go off when i pass by seems to happen all the time never thought to never thought to question why
40751 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
40752 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service
40753 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
40754 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
40755 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
40756 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
40757 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
40758 the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
40759 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
40760 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
40761 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
40762 left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed
40763 whats at stake here goes to the very core of the values of the military and the nation itself
40764 when our sons and daughters put their lives on the line to defend the rest of us the last thing they should fear is being attacked by one of our own
40765 mama dont get mad but when im mad at you and daddy i sometimes stick my tongue out at your back
40766 rub it on feel the warmth blow on it feel the heat
40767 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
40768 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around
40769 you really hope to see them not turn so much of a profit
40770 given todays strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the united states is a profitable strategy that will help our country decrease its dependence on foreign oil
40771 its not down but its marginally up in the low single digits our debit card spending on the other hand has continued to grow and is very robust
40772 we also do believe that the housing prices and the restrictions in credit for consumers have an impact on consumers utilizing their cards
40773 were not in the business of being arbitrageurs on transactions closing
40774 beer is living proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy
40775 lubow recalled last month laughing as she told the legendary story of her initial days at microsoft
40776 running errands taking care of the office bringing bill lunch he never ate lunch so i as a mother decided that was not good and i offered to bring him hamburgers every day that was his steady diet
40777 she paid attention to stuff that the rest of us geeks just werent that inclined to pay attention to
40778 nobody could have thought it was going to get this big
40779 im thanking everybody for having been such a wonderful part of my life
40780 its difficult yet im grateful that im able to do this because some people just drop dead on the golf course and dont have time to say goodbye or thank you

40812 over the years dish network has maintained a very competitive high definition offering in the marketplace providing customers with a premium hd product including the best technology signal and experience at the best value that no other pay tv provider can come close to matching our latest system upgrade coupled with the introduction of turbohd further strengthens our position as the leader in digital television and high definition television
40813 we know that once consumers start watching their favorite tv shows in high definition their viewing habits change and their preference switches to all hd programming only dish network gives them that option all for an industry low price of 24 99 per month
40814 if there is an economic slowdown no one bothered to tell the mobile device buying public
40815 in particular consumers in emerging markets in asia the middle east africa and south america shrugged off inflation fears to sign up as mobile phone users these healthy gains in net subscriber additions are stimulating replacement and upgrade sales in developed markets handset purchases tended to be flat but those consumers who did purchase dug deeper and paid out more for coveted higher end handsets and smart phones
40816 there is admittedly turmoil in the global economy but the mass markets fascination with getting the latest and greatest handset shows no sign of abating
40817 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
40818 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony reception towards these devices has been warm and as we head into the holiday quarter demand for these and other devices will no doubt increase
40819 smartphones are still seeing growth rates hovering around 40 0 year over year while the rest of the industry is growing at roughly 10 0
40820 however grouping the rest of the handsets into one category is doing the industry no justice the rise of the feature phone has created a battle at the high end of the market with the main difference between smartphone and feature phone being the high level operating system we expect the competition at the high end will help drive growth within the market and help move volume to higher end devices

40876 the recent clashes between the security forces and the taliban in swat revealed the real nature of the so called peace deal between the nwfp government and the taliban
40877 it is as a result of this deal that peace in peshawar is now in danger
40878 but despite this the nwfp government is not taking a serious view of the situation in the province
40879 no one in chief minister hotis government and in his ruling awami national party anp knows how to deal with the situation in the nwfp
40880 in the event of a military operation there will not be peace even in peshawar which has become a refuge for people who fled from the clashes in swat and malakand as well as in parachinar and miranshah in the tribal districts
40881 no one in chief minister ameer haider khan hotis government and in his ruling awami national party anp knows how to deal with the situation in the nwfp except federally nominated governor owais ghani
40882 chief minister ameer haider khan hoti certainly failed to discuss the nwfps rights and especially the issue of establishing peace with president pervez musharraf and with prime minister yousuf raza gilani the ruling anp was angry about interior security advisor rahman maliks statement about the peace deal which it characterized as a federal interference in the affairs of the province with the peace of the province and the lives of its people at stake the nwfp governments childish complaints are tantamount to inviting disaster

40889 everybody got off the bus me and a trucker that stopped and the greyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still alive or we could help or something like that
40890 and when we all got up we saw that the guy was cutting off the guys head when he saw us he came back to the front of the bus told the driver to shut the door he pressed the button and the door shut but it didnt shut in time and the guy was able to get his knife out and take a swipe at us
40891 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
40892 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
40893 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy

40968 se trata de un conflicto por dinero y poder ni siquiera hay una discusi n ideol gica todos ellos entienden la tierra como una mercanc a y pelean por ver qui n se queda con la mayor parte las cuatro entidades son totalmente opuestas a nuestra ideolog a con un trasfondo hist rico que a n no est saldado donde hubo usurpaci n y desaparici n de una gran parte de nuestro pueblo no nos olvidamos de ese crimen

40974 el gobierno provincial alienta cuatro polos productivos la industria del az car y el tabaco el turismo y la miner a todas ellas atentan contra nuestros territorios y nuestra forma de vida
40975 repudiamos las pol ticas de exclusi n y saqueo de los territorios en que vivimos pol ticas promovidas por los grupos econ micos que tienen como c mplices a los gobiernos de turno

41530 because of your work senator obama asked hillary to be his keynote speaker at the democratic national convention
41531 regretfully this means that senator hillary clinton is no longer under consideration as senator obamas running mate
41532 all indications we have from people close to senator clinton and senator obama are that hillary is not on the short list
41533 it means that some 98 000 pages of evidence which the state confiscated in raids on mr zumas homes and also those of his legal adviser at the time two of his legal advisers can be used as evidence against him in the corruption trial which is scheduled to get underway next week
41534 it flows out of the conviction in 2005 of his former financial adviser schabir sheik and it revolves around money that was said to have been solicited by zuma in order that he would intervene on behalf of a company bidding for parts of south africas arms deal
41535 on these particular matters yes but he will next week seek to have the entire case thrown out of court when his trial is due to begin in kwazulu natal province in pietermartizburg there are also other applications pending one in mauritius another in the united kingdom where he is seeking to have the release of documents to the national prosecuting authority blocked

41546 free speech is a right reserved only for those we agree with
41547 you know i dont pay attention to john mccains ads although i do notice he doesnt seem to have anything to say very positive about himself he seems to only be talking about me you need to ask john mccain what hes for and not just what hes against

41552 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
41553 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
41554 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
41555 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me

41562 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
41563 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city

41568 the ioc would like to stress that no deal with the chinese authorities to censor the internet has ever in any way been entered into

41570 you would all appreciate that you cant hide and that when there is an issue even ive learnt that youve got to front up and face up to it
41571 so i would have thought it could have been dealt a little bit earlier or at least you should have had access to people earlier than i sense is the case
41572 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them

41661 estoy de acuerdo con ello y me decepciona que el senador obama haya dicho las cosas que afirm
41662 lo que barack obama aludi fue a que no lleg aqu donde est despu s de pasar d cadas en washington
41663 aqu s lo se refiere a que es nuevo en el escenario pol tico no tiene que ver con la raza

41690 during saddams time we were not allowed to conduct such festivals
41691 the only festivals were religious since the liberation of iraq the security situation was not safe enough to conduct any festivals the 4th bct soldiers have made our area safe and this is the reason we were able to hold this festival

41694 it was an honor to be invited to attend the play and the people were able to see the strong bond between cf and the people of seddah

41696 probably the most exciting thing for me is i compare today to our partnership with the ia in 2006 and its night and day
41697 the future is the ia taking up training all on its own its already begun
41698 we make sure the iraqis get the necessary training and advice so that they may operate their own military properly
41699 its a good sign to see them taking control of their own country
41700 the good news story is that at the end of the day there was no fighting in amarah and if the goi can secure that city then the population will resist extremist members from coming back they will look down upon violence as well as the fact that the isf is in control
41701 everything is an improvement from a year ago attacks are down and the people are turning in more caches
41702 giving control back to the iraqi people was the key
41703 the threat of ieds has gone down so much since i last deployed to iraq it used to be a pretty regular thing to get hit
41704 we go out each night and sweep different areas but are not turning up very much at all anymore
41705 i would characterize the enemy in our area as being neutralized we still see occasional aqi violence in the area and were very watchful to ensure we dont allow a resurgence of aqi activity
41706 most people believe that aqi has fled al anbar at least for the time being and its our responsibility to make sure that they cant reestablish themselves back in our area

41871 obama seems to have been more concerned with how the visit would affect him than how it would affect the soldiers recovering from wounds received in the service of their country
41872 last week senator obama skipped a visit with wounded u s troops at landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital i served as director of trauma surgery at that hospital for nearly four years and saw the effect that a visit from a celebrity like senator obama could have on morale during that time i do not recall a single member of congress canceling a visit with the troops despite being just a few hours away but senator obama seems to have been more concerned with how the visit would affect him than how it would affect the soldiers recovering from wounds received in the service of their country

41881 estoy de acuerdo con ello y me decepciona que el senador obama haya dicho las cosas que afirm

41894 its difficult to say how good a job we have done
41895 in germany we definitely didnt have the speed that we were hoping for but then there were many other people who didnt either we will see this weekend you can always think that from the testing that we found something and at least we should understand better what our position is but racing is a different place and hopefully we will do better here in budapest we will just keep pushing and at some point it will start going better again for us in jerez we tried to more or less understand if we have done something wrong taken a wrong direction we tried many many things and we at least know where we had a problem and i think we have a clearer picture than before
41896 of course you always look at what your teammate is doing and then in the end you need to do what you think is the best way and what is best for you sometimes the data from the two cars can be very close sometimes they are further away from each other and i would say that this year they would probably be closer than they were last year but it really depends from race to race and it keeps changing
41897 i never said anything like i would retire at the end of next year
41898 i only said that i have a contract until the end of next year and then somebody made up that i will stop at the end of this year or the end of next year but i never said that like i said there are a lot of other things in life but at the moment im enjoying this job and i have a great time doing it and i have a great time with the team of course it would be good if we could do a little bit better right now but thats racing and for sure we will get where we want to be

41927 its been a real tough last 48 hours coming to this decision in my heart
41928 what simply happened is the situation just didnt feel right
41929 i told him im sorry for that but i also looked bowlen in the eye and said i gave you everything i could in terms of trying to do that
41930 i would like to start out by saying im going to pull a brett favre on you
41931 i want to thank mike president and chief executive officer pat bowlen and the broncos organization
41932 i would just like to thank everybody for the great years here i wish this team all the best i really like the feel of this team and thats what made this an extra hard decision this team has a great chemistry to it and i think they are going to do very well i wish them i wish mike i wish everybody the best
41933 no its not just based on playing time i dont know exactly what that will be ill talk to a team i think i have a pretty good gauge of a situation that would be right ill consider my family ill consider everything if one presents itself it feels good and it feels like something where i would put forth the commitment then i will do it because i only know one way of doing it and thats full speed ahead so im going to make sure its right but well see well start that process
41934 i havent had a lot of conversations with the guys in the locker room it all kind of happened suddenly i left yesterday i had an opportunity to go out with about six of the guys hopefully they came back to the meetings on time and in good shape we had a nice time just kind of celebrating our time together and wishing them the best of luck i wanted to explain to them what had gone down ill have an opportunity in the coming days to talk to my teammates
41935 first of all i dont regret the fact that i spent my whole offseason working for this i put my whole heart into it it was a different situation for me i had somewhat come at peace with even the role of the playing time and thats a hard thing for me to do im a prideful guy and it was hard for me to let go of that but i at some point had a level of comfort and peace with that but it went even beyond that as i was telling my wife linda the one thing ive always done is when i stepped in between those lines is ive always enjoyed myself in the locker room ive always enjoyed myself when ive stepped in between the lines and the last couple days at the practice field i wasnt doing that and thats when i knew that something had to change
41936 i came to grips with not being a full time player i had reached some level of peace but it probably was that it just wasnt sitting right like i said i just knew that you know why prolong the situation i felt like for the teams best interest and for my best interest it was time to make a change
41937 i tried to take an approach coming into camp this year where i was just going to enjoy every opportunity to get on that field and every second i think it was different in that for the last 14 15 years being a starter in this league the expectations for the organization are that i would play at a pro bowl level and help carry a team this year i think i was treated very fairly but there really were no expectations so it was a different scenario for me i think i handled it well i prepared myself got to an incredible fitness level and i was ready to play but like i said it just ultimately wasnt the right situation
41938 i spoke to john after our last ota day and after our last ota day john came up to me and said mike if the season started today where do you see me
41939 i sat down with john and i said hey you would be our first team safety but you wouldnt be in our nickel package
41940 then after tuesdays practice he came up to me and he said hey mike i need about 24 hours to think about what i want to do he said right now not playing nickel and not playing dime i am kind of losing concentration with what you are doing even with your base defense therefore its kind of tough for me i said hey take as much time as you want he came back to me and said i am the kind of guy that really had to be involved ive been a pro bowl player and a consummate pro and i kind of dont like the role that i am in now and it is very tough on me i said john you have given everything to this organization that a guy could give and if you think it is not going to work out here on an every down basis and you would like to look at other opportunities i am not going to stand in your way you have given me too much and you have been too much of a pro i dont think that i have ever been with more of a pro then with a guy like john lynch he is the type of guy you look at in the future and say hey this guy could be the president of the united states he is that type of guy i felt like i owed it to him to let him look at his options whether its football or retirement whatever he wants to do he has given everything that he could give in the four years that he has been here when a guy is not happy it doesnt feel right and i want to give him his opportunity to do what he thinks is right for his future
41941 to be honest with you when i talked with him after ota days you could see how important it was i talked to john and told him the reason he is so successful is because he has that mindset he wants to be out there every down but if he is not he would be such a great teacher toward the young guys but wouldnt be happy missing first and second down what has made john a hall of fame player is that he has that type of mindset he wants to play every down and i cant blame him and im not going to say that he cant i had to give him an honest evaluation of where we were and what we thought as a staff one thing you never do to a veteran player is never lie to them you tell them exactly where they stand so he can see his role if he accepts that you can do some good things and if he doesnt then the best you can do sometimes is part ways if you are honest with each other than you have a chance for good things to happen and i wish him well
41942 you never find players like john lynch from a leadership standpoint they are one in a million like i said he has everything you look for in a person and in a player it is tough but we have some excellent players that are out there right now that are competing like i said to john its hard for me to say that you are not going to be the starter in our nickel package i said i have to be honest right now you would not be he believes that there are other opportunities out there for him if he gets one i will be rooting for john as long as he is not in the afc west if it is i will be rooting for him as a person just not in the games we play him
41943 i think that john is probably the most well rounded person i have been with
41944 well like i said thats the reason why he is a hall of fame player the reason why he has been to nine pro bowls the reason why he has won a super bowl the reason why he was the leader in tampa and a four year captain here he is a true pro but you have to be honest with him to and you have to tell him how we see his role what has made john the type of player he is is that he believes that he is the type of player that is going to go out there and do it and i am not going to question it that is where we are at right now
41945 what i have to do is tell him what i see his role is i told him that is where i see you now i said at the end of training camp you could be first team safety and on the first team nickel or you can be a second team safety and a second team nickel i said i dont know the only way we are going to know is how you practice on a day to day basis and as you get older we are all evaluated that way and that is what i have to do with these players with these players you come in the locker room every day i dont care if you are a first round draft choice a pro bowl player i dont care what you have done we are going to go out there and compete every day and the best people are going to play when you have a guy like john who is year in and year out when you lose a guy like that it is tough i shared that little bit of conversation that i shared with you with our players last night any time they lose a guy like john they deserved to know exactly the conversation i had with him a month or month and a half before one thing about john lynch whatever he does he is going to be the best at it
41946 john is such a pro that you really dont know i knew john would never be happy not playing every down and that is what has made john john some players accept the role that if they are not starters then they can work with the young guys and build up there game and some guys are so competitive they want to be out there every down if not they would rather retire and i respect that or they want to go on another team where they can start do that john is going to check out his options and the great thing about it is that he is healthy and he has worked his rear end off you have a guy that takes care of himself as i said i wish him well
41947 any time you are not on the first unit you dont get a lot of reps its like the second and third players dont get a lot of reps you are evaluated every day with you base packages as well as your nickel packages john shared with me he said hey i have lost some of my concentration even in our base packages i have made some mistakes that i never make just because i was thinking of the disappointment of not playing all the time i understand his thought process and i respect it and that is one of the reasons why we released him
41948 rod has been gone for awhile he got hurt and i think everybody knows his injury and when it occurred even though retirement was just a short time ago rod hasnt been with us his presence hasnt been out on the field i think john said it best if youre not out there playing its hard to lead rod smith even though he was a consummate pro its hard to be a leader when you are not out there guys have to step up and take leadership roles we have a young football team and some older vets it will be interesting to see who will step up and take the leadership role
41949 whatshername and that guy have agreed to give those people that house for a ridiculously low sum of money thanks

41958 the strong performance of our utility group reflects the implementation of base rate changes in the indiana service territories beginning in the second half of 2007 and the continued ramp up of operating costs that result from increased maintenance and reliability costs contemplated in the base rate cases
41959 the decline in performance of our nonutility group is primarily due to lower cash to nymex and summer winter price spreads in the wholesale natural gas markets which have reduced proliance energy llcs opportunities for optimization of storage and transportation resources while earnings from our nonutility group have not met our expectations we believe this portfolio including our coal and infrastructure businesses coupled with our strong utility platform provide the opportunity for long term earnings growth

42054 we acquired eddie drummond a kick return specialist who spent most of his time in detroit and was with kansas city last year
42055 we needed a guy in that capacity to add to the competition when we lost kevin marion a couple of days back
42056 drummond is a return man who has some special teams background in other areas being a gunner covering kickoffs hes shown hes capable of doing that over the course of his career
42057 it looks like its going to require some surgery he is out
42058 we gave them the morning off but more than just giving them the morning off we provided some therapeutic options were getting to that point in training camp where we need to do a nice job of taking care of ourselves whether its therapy aquatic training weight training massages we provided a myriad of things for those guys this morning they took advantage of it it was productive for us we got some guys who had missed some time some day to day guys who got back out there this afternoon that was a good thing it was a good spirited practice but were still coming together as a football team i like where we are
42059 travis kirschke will be back tomorrow we just gave him a day today a little preventative if you will he was starting to feel a little repercussions in his back we gave him the day off and hell be back tomorrow anthony smith attempted to go started practice but wasnt able to finish with his groin he might be more than day to day at this point bryant mcfadden came back successfully as did james farrior mike humpal went out with a slight hamstring that might be heat related well see where he is hopefully hes day to day everybody else is status quo
42060 the old wide receiver in me when you see guys struggling to pick up the blur of the ball thats one of the first things you look at
42061 we did there was a minor issue there and hopefully its a winning edge for him by no means are we going to lean on it hes got to go out and catch footballs
42062 theres a little focus on bruce right now because he went to a quarter school ucla and he missed quite a bit of time during the offseason because of that
42063 he wasnt able to participate due to rules hes got to hurry up to catch up hes in the process of doing that which might require an extra rep or two hes in great shape and hes going to need it because he has some ground to make up
42064 an ounce of prevention is better than tons of cure
42065 they should be doing the right thing they know better than that

42068 service users held some misinformed views of the powers of social workers to remove their children from them an overarching fear experienced by the majority of those reported to the system
42069 in a number of cases negative perceptions were modified once service users engaged with the services however a number of interviewees were very dissatisfied with the way that mistaken or malicious reports about them were handled
42070 while the hse noted references in dr buckleys report from service users describing social workers as lacking in empathy we would equally note and recognise her reference to reports of social workers considered to be understanding kind and calm
42071 it is therefore noteworthy that four out of 10 of the respondents in the research sought out contact with these services and many had positive things to report about the services they subsequently received
42072 it is important to realise that children first while not on a statutory basis still brings with it very clear responsibilities for those who become aware of child protection issues and these responsibilities are those we would reasonably expect everyone in society to live up to in relation to caring for children
42073 actively engaged in a process of standardisation across the country
42074 the establishment of the hse as a single national health service provided us with the opportunity to achieve this
42075 todays publications have confirmed that our child protection services are chaotic uncoordinated and grossly inadequate

42100 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her
42101 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
42102 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard

42132 i think it exemplifies mlbs dedication to miami and i think its a great step for us
42133 we have to sell baseball at the grassroots level and our fan base has to grow significantly by the time we get into the new facility and the more people who are exposed to baseball i think it helps us sell the game to people and helps people become a fan of baseball
42134 i was confident that we had a really good chance just because the efforts and the quality of our proposal both financially and with the detail we attended to it
42135 i feel like we responded very favorably to all the expectations

42155 the letter itself is basically a threat to bring legal action so the only cost involved is paying a lawyer to draft it its therefore very easy for a large organisation to impose their will over someone whom they know is unlikely to be able to afford legal representation it can make little difference how strong their case actually is

42162 it is an abnormal hike which has never been witnessed in the past the airlines have formed a cartel and there is no monitoring by the government
42163 there is also no regulatory body for the civil aviation sector like trai in telecom the government should call the airlines and take necessary steps to prevent burdening of the people

42182 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
42183 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
42184 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
42185 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
42186 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
42187 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
42188 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
42189 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues
42190 they ask us about the economy they want to talk about our plans for keeping the country safe and thats the campaign were running

42195 it was only the following day he dismembered the girls body he took various photos of the chopped up body with his cellphones camera including photos like those of the taliban where the decapitated head is placed on top of the body it said
42196 weve seen a run of softer data and we also started seeing the reserve bank make noises about the fact they were happy with the current policy settings
42197 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
42198 we still think petrol prices have been the biggest issue weakening retail trade

42207 i had an 18 footer for par that broke six feet the last two feet it went sideways almost stopped then trickled in
42208 that was big because even though it was early in the round it really kept my momentum going
42209 i maybe hit it a little better in canada and it was one more birdie and no bogeys
42210 i came back from there and i was still playing well no top 10s but still good showings the last few weeks have been a little shaky the swing got a little out of kilter but i got it back on track and felt good going in to today all in all i did everything i was supposed to im not used to holing 25 foot putts so when i make those its an extra bonus for me
42211 it was nice to go bogey free i havent done that in a while
42212 it may be an advantage to have played early as the wind is picking up and some footprints on the greens could make it tricky later today
42213 i hit a solid tee shot but it bounced left and i was lucky to be in bounds
42214 i got a good break and turned it into a par almost made birdie you sure dont want to give one back on that hole particularly when you have a good round going
42215 im feeling pretty confident with the putter this week which is huge out here
42216 i wasnt too happy with the way i hit it today but putting makes up for a lot i guess im putting well because im hitting it closer
42217 overall inflation remains robust even though a price increase in utilities accounted for almost half of the total monthly increase
42218 if this is the case the peak in yearly inflation that looks to have formed should be confirmed
42219 the monetary policy deliberations from the rba board next tuesday will be a tug of war between these recessionary indicators and the still high rate of inflation as shown in the inflation gauge for july

42225 on jan 7 th 2007 i as part of a closed team i was blindly tasked with the target which is the title of the headline above at the time the authorities involved were still mainly looking over land for the missing plane overall the group did really well on this target with coherent and matching data throughout three of the remote viewers describing a vehicle crash event the last paragraph of my session summary is as follows overall i would say the target involves intense erratic natural motion which affects a manmade structure s and life the motion comes in waves and builds to a point then slowly dissipates the natural motion feels like water the key part of the target indicate underneath so i feel there may have been an event whereby the structure or life went under the water due to a natural event that was a surprise event this target happened in the past my very first impression from the moment i closed my eyes and tried to home in on the target was of flying over water which is clearly recorded in the first line of the session i think youll see from the data and from the sketches that i was clearly on target and this is a good start to the year

42236 we already knew the economy was weak and now you have both a negative growth number coupled with job losses
42237 its not as good as wed like it to be but i want to remind you a few months ago there were predictions and that the economy would shrink this quarter not grow
42238 clearly the tax rebates did give some oomph to the economy
42239 in an environment where the global economy is clearly slowing youre not being able to get that export growth in future quarters

42242 the unemployment rate is giving you a misleading impression of some of the adjustments that are taking place
42243 hours cut is a big deal people still have a job but they are losing income
42244 the change in working hours is the canary in the coal mine
42245 first you see hours get short and eventually more people will get laid off

42273 i think they are absolutely beaten and the reason i dont think they can come back is because of the iraqi security forces

42330 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
42331 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
42332 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
42333 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
42334 in that sense hes going to have to move something he hasnt characteristically done in his entire career

42388 estas opiniones contribuir n en la decisi n que tomar n los diputados al votar las iniciativas relativas a la reforma energ tica que actualmente se debate en el congreso
42389 respetuosamente le pido a felipe calder n flexibilizar su posici n y abrir la puerta para que con la opini n de expertos se construya una reforma energ tica en contra de la privatizaci n de pemex
42390 se apeg a los principios de certeza y transparencia para garantizar la libre expresi n de la ciudadan a

42397 todas las denuncias 230 fueran an nimas algunos nos mandaron por correo electr nico tenemos el mail de las personas hemos sido muy cuidadosos de las diferentes fotograf as y audios y si ellos nos permiten revelar su identidad incluida esta persona lo haremos si no la de todos lo dem s con mucho gusto las daremos a conocer
42398 para ver qu fue lo que lo motiv a participar 35 veces me imagino que era tambi n para demostrar que era una consulta ama ada y descuidada
42399 es muy claro los mismos responsables de la elecci n interna del prd son responsables de la consulta equivale al mismo cochinero de la ciudad de m xico
42400 se evidenci que hasta votaron en 35 ocasiones manuel camacho declar que para participar dos veces la persona se tendr a que cortar el dedo pero este sujeto aparece con los diez dedos sin ning n dedo cortado y vot 35 veces es una demostraci n de que esta consulta fue ama ada y que como l pudieron haber muchos otros que votaron varias veces
42401 certeza plena de que el rgano electoral trabaje siempre apegado a la ley respetando los principios fundamentales de la democracia y pugnando siempre por la equidad entre los actores
42402 la elecci n de 2009 se ve vulnerable porque tambi n intervino el iedf
42403 son recursos de los capitalinos los que se usaron en el gasto excesivo que se dio en esta consulta partidista y le estamos pidiendo al jefe de gobierno que presente el gasto total y nos detalle cu nto se gast en la difusi n de la consulta en medios de comunicaci n as como en la papeler a que se utiliz para los carteles y volantes
42404 nos preguntamos de d nde salieron todos esos recursos y hasta hoy quedan muchas dudas que resolver
42405 ser enga ados con supuestas consultas que buscan generar movilizaciones en el pa s
42406 no se vender ni un solo tornillo est n manipulando a los ciudadanos con esas ideas
42407 habr seis millones por a o ya no habr n m s empleos en estados unidos sino en m xico
42408 estoy segura que saldr n adelante tenemos que dejar a un lado las diferencias partidistas para pensar que es lo que le conviene a m xico
42409 d gase lo que se diga ha sido uno de los ejercicios de participaci n ciudadana m s exitosa en la historia de la ciudad de m xico

42412 para el prd es un insumo que sin duda va a ser importante
42413 no logr el prop sito de descarrilar desprestigiar o contravenir el proceso que se construye para alcanzar los acuerdos
42414 los ingredientes los cocineros y hasta el horno y de hecho la nica que falta es la del prd
42415 la conformaci n de una posici n cada vez m s numerosa en favor de sentarse a la mesa presentar propuestas y discutir
42416 de colgarle medallitas a calder n al pan o al pri
42417 siendo consencuentes con lo que se ala la consulta ratificando que no vamos a privatizar pemex pero s vamos a reformar la paraestatal
42418 cuando nosotros hemos construido una ruta de entendimiento con los pri stas
42419 el fap fue el que logr el debate en el senado y vamos por m s
42420 cierto es que hemos tenido diferencias dentro del sol azteca pero el petr leo nos ha unido aqu y en toda la rep blica los integrantes del frente amplio progresista prd pt y convergencia con todo y sus dos grandes bloques hemos trabajado juntos
42421 vean lo que est haciendo guadalupe acosta en representaci n del prd lo que hace navarrete como coordinador del prd en el congreso lo que hacen los compa eros de convergencia en pocas palabras fue el fap el que logr el debate en el senado y lograremos m s con esta consulta
42422 de este porcentaje 91 por ciento dijo no a la reforma petrolera y 9 por ciento vot por el s
42423 pero en favor de los intereses econ micos y contra los m s necesitados a los que no quiere dar siquiera la oportunidad de manifestarse en una consulta popular
42424 para entregar pemex a las empresas extranjeras los enemigos del pueblo el pan grandes empresarios jerarcas cat licos y membretes ultraderechistas se unieron en contra de la la consulta
42425 el grupo ultraderechista yo influyo fundado hace unos a os por fernando s nchez argumedo y rosa mar tha abascal de arton hija de carlos abascal trat de desacreditar la consulta popular sobre la privatizaci n de pemex con argumentos legaloides y autoritarios

42428 ferozmente a marcelo ebrard alegando que la consulta popular sobre la reforma energ tica es una maniobra del gobierno del distrito federal para distraer la atenci n sobre el caso de la discoteca news divine
42429 una parte de la jerarqu a cat lica al apoyar las iniciativas privatizadoras del gobierno federal
42430 adopt esa posici n y atacaba directamente a la oposici n y hac a propaganda en favor del gobierno de calder n en lo referente a pemex
42431 una decisi n soberana de un pa s en la defensa de los intereses nacionales siempre tendr el respeto del gobierno espa ol y siempre defenderemos a su vez los derechos econ micos de las empresas espa olas si hay una inversi n de 2 mil millones de euros hay que respetar esos derechos y creo que eso nadie lo discute
42432 en relaci n al referendo que se ha hecho sobre la reforma energ tica lo nico que voy a decir es que no voy a faltar al respeto a las decisiones soberanas de un pa s repercutan como repercutan en las relaciones bilaterales si un pa s o un gobierno toma una decisi n en el ejercicio de su soberan a como es una nacionalizaci n como ocurri en bolivia lo nico que va a hacer el gobierno espa ol si hay inversiones espa olas es defender los derechos econ micos de las empresas que ya invirtieron eso es lo que har el gobierno espa ol porque tenemos que respetar las decisiones soberanas
42433 no s si el referendo es o no vinculante pero el presidente felipe calder n fue muy claro dijo que se aprobar a la reforma conforme a la legislaci n nacional y si no se puede no se puede vino a decir aqu
42434 eso yo recuerdo haberlo o do en una conversaci n con el presidente zapatero por tanto no voy a hablar si me parece mejor o no introducir criterios de privatizaci n para lograr una mayor eficiencia y eficacia eso estar a de m s por mi parte lo que s puedo decir es que nosotros llevamos a cabo varios procesos de privatizaci n de algunos sectores p blicos para lograr hacerlos m s eficientes pero eso fue en la coyuntura y en la decisi n soberana de espa a durante el gobierno de felipe gonz lez
42435 la situaci n de desaceleraci n econ mica o de crisis que se vive a escala internacional en espa a no lo vamos a solucionar porque compremos parte de nuestro petr leo a precio m s bajo
42436 el acuerdo que todav a hay que concretar con venezuela pretende m s garantizar el suministro de petr leo que obtenerlo a precio m s bajo as es que no se trata de paliar la crisis sino de un intercambio que es beneficioso para ambos pa ses la propuesta vino del presidente ch vez porque era un acuerdo que tambi n hab a hecho con portugal y nosotros desde luego la acogimos con mucha satisfacci n
42437 con 68 por ciento de los votos computados en nueve entidades sin considerar al distrito federal se tuvo una votaci n de 721 mil 827 sufragios que sumados a los obtenidos en la capital del pa s rebasan el mill n y medio de votos
42438 esas cifras son ya indicativas del sentido de la consulta
42439 francamente es muy bueno estamos muy satisfechos si sumamos las cifras del distrito federal con las obtenidas en esas nueve entidades ya rebasamos el mill n y medio de participaci n que hab a definido como el punto de xito
42440 los resultados insisti son muy buenos porque a n falta de computarse 30 por ciento de la votaci n en los estados referidos y ya rebasamos el mill n y medio de asistentes
42441 hay personas que s lo contestaron una tambi n hay informes de que se tienen 16 mil 256 votos nulos
42442 el resultado obtenido es bastante bueno para una consulta que no cont con una estructura gubernamental es el ejercicio ciudadano m s exitoso que ha habido por mucho en el pa s y en la ciudad
42443 sta realizada el domingo donde s hubo controles y un ejemplo de ello fue que habitantes del estado de m xico quer an votar aqu en el distrito federal y no lo pudieron hacer porque as se estableci la norma
42444 establecimos que si lleg bamos en la primera fase de la consulta a un mill n y medio de votos lo bamos a considerar un xito sab amos que era muy dif cil y m ximo teniendo una campa a en contra como la que tuvimos
42445 hay boletas con errores y por ello se tienen 16 mil 256 votos nulos pese a ello nadie ha hecho una consulta tan exitosa en el pa s como sta
42446 si el gobierno hubiera sabido que ganar a la consulta desde luego que habr a participado incluso el jefe del ejecutivo tiene la atribuci n en el art culo 26 constitucional para convocar a una consulta popular cuando una decisi n va a afectar de manera significativa el plan nacional de desarrollo o los programas sectoriales
42447 es indicativa por d nde anda la voluntad del pueblo mexicano eso es muy importante ya adem s si bien es cierto que no es vinculatoria para el congreso s debe serlo para los legisladores del frente amplio progresista para ellos s es obligatorio que se vayan por ese camino que indic la consulta
42448 felipe calder n pudo haber convocado a la consulta y no lo hizo
42449 un patr n de irregularidades que lleven a concluir que existi un acto deliberado de equis actor por violentar la pulcritud del ejercicio ciudadano
42450 ya lo quisi ramos en alguno de los procesos que organiza el instituto federal electoral
42451 una jornada con un patr n de normalidad en el desarrollo de la consulta aunque afluencia ciudadana desigual la instalaci n de las mesas se realiz de manera normal aunque con retrasos en algunas zonas y hubo funcionarios sin la debida capacitaci n y conocimiento sobre el proceso
42452 hasta el momento los reportes de inducci n del voto mentada de madre cerraz n y violaci n al proceso son incidentes que no reflejan un patr n y una voluntad determinadas es decir hay elecciones en las que claramente existe un patr n de irregularidades que lleva a concluir que hay un acto deliberado de equis actor de violentar la pulcritud del procedimiento
42453 este ejercicio fue de una total democracia que se realiz en la paz m s absoluta y los ciudadanos aprendieron a darle importancia a sus leyes y a la toma de decisiones
42454 me da mucho gusto que esta consulta se haya realizado es muy importante para m que nac en un poca en la que las mujeres no ten amos libertad de decir ni pensar como hoy lo hacemos me duele la propuesta de calder n porque me parece que es de miras muy estrechas y necesitamos un proyecto de naci n sobre todo en el tema energ tico porque es demasiado valioso para malbaratarlo m xico tiene muchos talentos j venes los cuales pueden resolver problemas con miras al futuro y a las necesidades de esta naci n
42455 fue un orgullo que me invitaran a esta consulta porque considero que fue un gran paso de la democracia mexicana el hecho de que los ciudadanos se acercaran a las urnas libremente por primera vez a un ejercicio como ste es un gran logro durante la jornada sobresali la organizaci n de las casillas y la capacitaci n de las personas lo nico que lamento es que en coyoac n no hubo la respuesta que esper bamos para ese acto pol tico de primera importancia de manera preliminar nos han informado que las diferencias entre el s y el no son contundentes el m ximo para el s fue de 17 por ciento y eso nos revela que la votaci n por el no fue arrolladora
42456 mejor en las calles donde estamos acostumbrados a lidiar con ellos
42457 eso es mejor que verlos ejerciendo el poder donde representan una verdadera amenaza para los intereses creados
42458 es verdaderamente un ejemplo porque es fundamental e indispensable que a la hora de tomar decisiones de la pol tica de un recurso como es el petr leo para m xico que tiene una historia importante en el plano de preservar sus recursos naturales sea la decisi n popular la que determine el destino de la explotaci n del petr leo en m xico
42459 buena y rica experiencia porque hemos visto con toda tranquilidad y normalidad la participaci n sin ninguna agresividad sin ning n control policial hemos visto que los patriotas en diferentes mesas se suman y est n participando normalmente
42460 los efectos de este ejercicio democr tico ser n justamente los que merece la enorme participaci n de la poblaci n en esta ciudad y en el resto de la rep blica
42461 actualmente la explotaci n transporte distribuci n almacenamiento y refinaci n de los hidrocarburos son actividades exclusivas del gobierno est usted de acuerdo o no est de acuerdo que en esas actividades puedan ahora participar empresas privadas
42462 en general est usted de acuerdo o no est de acuerdo con que se aprueben las iniciativas relativas a la reforma energ tica que se debaten actualmente en el congreso de la uni n
42463 a trav s de referendos hemos logrado en los a os del neoliberalismo defender las empresas petrolera telef nica de electricidad y de agua para que sigan en manos del estado y beneficiar a la sociedad
42464 es un s ntoma de que las derechas en todo el mundo no apuestan por la participaci n de los ciudadanos hacen foros y hablan de la democracia pero en el momento de respetarla y llevarla adelante le dan la espalda
42465 es realmente algo muy peligroso para la democracia cuando los representantes del pueblo no respetan la opini n del pueblo y pasa que los ciudadanos les d n la espalda y no los reelija
42466 como latinoamericano lo que siempre valor fue que en la d cada de los 30 el gobierno mexicano hubiera recuperado para el pueblo la producci n petrolera y me parece que ser a un retroceso que aquello que se recuper ahora tenga que revertirse en funci n de los intereses del sector privado
42467 tenemos que defendernos de la voracidad de las multinacionales y de los sectores privados locales de querer quitar al pueblo los recursos que tendr an que beneficiar a toda la sociedad
42468 creo que s habr una respuesta clara en t rminos de movilizaci n y reclamo cada vez m s fuerte
42469 pienso que lo mismo debe ser en m xico y en todos los pa ses que tenemos petr leo tratar de recuperarlo para que as se mejore la educaci n la salud y las condiciones de vida de la gente
42470 el pueblo se levante y en alg n momento haga justicia
42471 excelente iniciativa digna de ser imitada por muchas fuerzas pol ticas de am rica latina
42472 si la consulta aun no siendo vinculatoria arroja un resultado abrumador por parte de la ciudadan a para mantener su industria petrolera como hasta ahora y es considerada leg tima pues obligatoriamente quienes toman las decisiones deber n tenerla en consideraci n
42473 el crimen del gobierno al intentar privatizar el patrimonio de los mexicanos es m s grave cuando se ve que en el mundo la tendencia es aumentar la participaci n del estado en la industria del petr leo no disminuirla
42474 es un gran triunfo para la ciudad de m xico es un gran triunfo para el pa s es un gran triunfo para el prd y es un gran triunfo para la democracia celebramos la participaci n ciudadana y agradecemos infinitamente a los habitantes de esta ciudad por haber participado en el refer ndum m s importante en la historia de esta ciudad sin duda las generaciones venideras nos lo agradecer n
42475 vencimos a los que hasta el ltimo momento trataron de convencer a la poblaci n con enga os a votar por el s a la reforma energ tica
42476 es decir todo lo que han podido hacer para desprestigiar la consulta lo han hecho
42477 como ciudadano vine a dar mi voto por el s a la reforma solo ejerc mis derechos
42478 era un compa ero que habl para decirme la casilla que me toc est exactamente a mil 300 metros de mi casa

42480 why need i even speak of it since it is imperishably held in the memory of all men
42481 georges foot turns inward and it is the right foot he walks quite on the side of his foot
42482 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
42483 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
42484 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
42485 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
42486 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
42487 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
42488 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
42489 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
42490 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
42491 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor

42493 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
42494 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
42495 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
42496 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
42497 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
42498 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
42499 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

42512 now new yorkers can drive across the border to a neighboring state and get a marriage license that will be recognized as fully legal and valid here at home
42513 this is a clarion call for the rest of the nation on the dangers of this radical social experiment and also the essential need for a federal marriage amendment to clearly define marriage as the union of one man and one woman
42514 same sex marriage is a social experiment and it certainly will have an impact on the culture particularly the children where we already see that in massachusetts children are being educated on the efficacy of same sex marriage and the irrelevance of fatherhood and motherhood

42624 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
42625 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
42626 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
42627 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
42628 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
42629 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
42630 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
42631 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
42632 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
42633 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
42634 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
42635 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
42636 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
42637 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
42638 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
42639 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
42640 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
42641 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
42642 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
42643 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
42644 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
42645 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
42646 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
42647 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
42648 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
42649 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
42650 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
42651 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
42652 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
42653 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
42654 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
42655 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
42656 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
42657 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
42658 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
42659 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
42660 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
42661 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
42662 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
42663 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
42664 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
42665 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
42666 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
42667 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
42668 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
42669 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
42670 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
42671 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
42672 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
42673 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
42674 a press not restricted or controlled by government censorship regarding politics or ideology
42675 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
42676 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
42677 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
42678 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
42679 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
42680 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
42681 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
42682 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
42683 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
42684 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
42685 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
42686 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
42687 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
42688 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
42689 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
42690 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
42691 who are open to doing something on the production side
42692 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
42693 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
42694 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

42697 the fact that we are not being told the real reasons for the disruption and expect reductions to be increased by more than 50 percent for the month of august shows the lack of transparency in the way the system works

42730 de enige verdienste van dit soort programmas is dat ze illustreren hoe regionaal de wielersport nog altijd is in het atletiek zijn zwarte atleten wereldvedetten maar gekleurde renners worden alleen opgevoerd als circusobject of om wat gratuite publiciteit mee te pikken rond diezelfde tijd lijfde de kleine wielerploeg rdm flanders een keniaan in duncan seko de manager van dat team kwam er rond voor uit dat hij hem alleen een contract had gegeven omdat het een zwarte was vriendelijk fotogeniek en dus goed voor de publiciteit of die man al dan niet over sportieve kwaliteiten beschikte was van geen tel nadat alle nederlandse en vlaamse kranten bij seko waren langs geweest voor een man bijt hond verhaal werd seko terug naar kenia gestuurd

42735 the goal to cleanse the anp is started here at the regional training center
42736 by cleanse i mean to make sure the people the anp are recruiting and training are good trustworthy people this is the start of that progression
42737 being responsible for the screening training them correctly and then sending them back out into the community so the people can trust them and believe in them is a huge step
42738 i think the biometrics screening process works as a deterrent
42739 if these men know that the system will identify anyone who has committed any crimes it will deter the criminals from trying to enter the force
42740 their previous pay by list system in which one person collects and distributes money for the group wasnt ideal by the time the money reached the students it wasnt the full amount they were owed
42741 now 17 of the 34 provinces in afghanistan have electronic funds transfer and its effective because it cuts down on the corruption of money changing hands
42742 this time we tried to hold them responsible for the process
42743 this not only standardizes the force but brings it up to a certain standard it gives them a greater capability to defend themselves as well as a better image
42744 we are a team and we are working together and helping to improve the police together
42745 our country is different because some people linked with the enemy try to join the police this system will find the bad people and keep them from our force the people of afghanistan will understand that

42786 my attitude to our friends in china is very simple they should have nothing to fear by open digital links with the rest of the world during this important international celebration of sport
42787 he clearly at some stage has been under the impression and you showed me the bit of paper saying there would be restrictions

42791 others in the ioc say there are no restrictions so well see im finding it a little confusing
42792 i made an opinion about what i feel is a leagues decision about players going to england
42793 the form of danny buderus and michael crocker warrants their selection in this squad and if they continue on that form theyll warrant selection in regards to the world cup
42794 when you look at the players that theyve picked theyre very proven at this level
42795 theyre players that have been in good form for their clubs as well
42796 mitchell goes along with young wallace its very difficult but its a squad that theyve picked and were very happy with
42797 we will choose the final team of 24 on october 6 after the nrl grand final
42798 the final team can include players not featured in the squad announced today which serves to put players on notice that the cup is just around the corner and selectors are closely monitoring form
42799 the announcement is a reminder to those named that selectors are looking at them very seriously
42800 to those who are disappointed at not being named there is still some work to be done but they are by no means out of contention

42816 pretty one you may remember from such films as la confidential i think that seeing these actors in these roles adds to the visual absurdity of the film along with the colorful outlandish costumes
42817 its so funny youll laugh so hard your lashes will curl all by themselves
42818 it is a fact that this country has made significant gains over the past four years and as a government and a people we cannot allow lawlessness and crime to erode the tangible benefits and the quality of life that our country now enjoys
42819 the truth is unpalatable to some people but the recent killing of dr mullany and the brutal attack on her husband are threats to our very survival as they directly threaten our main industry tourism

42843 yes my snot is neon no i cant breathe no im not pregnant
42844 ok pick up your antibiotics in an hour at kaiser
42845 cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
42846 the fire is the same the drive is the same
42847 it is very difficult we know it is very difficult to stay on top one of the quotes i have seen is once you get to the top of the mountain you look and see that there are other mountains that have to be climbed there are higher ones so that is the position that we take i have been in this a long time and i have been one of the other 31 for a long time and i have studied just as everyone does the team that wins it and in this case it is the two teams and others that were in the playoffs that are being studied hard but we know how that works having been there only further fires the idea of accepting the challenge and it is a great one
42848 just as the 17th week of the season last year bridged us over into the playoffs what training camp means to us is the opportunity to bridge forward into the new season and to put ourselves through the training camp grind if you will to pay the price to be in position to go forth into the new season realizing that no two years are ever the same and no two teams are ever the same with that being said we are excited and we are looking forward to getting the players here to having the conditioning run to getting on the field and to talking about the continuation of the improvement of our team recognizing the areas that we do need to improve in and there are many and trying to go ahead and raise the attitude the level the performance of our team consistent with winning the super bowl last february
42849 i know all the numbers and that will be the first lecture
42850 i know in particular what happened here i am just speculating on some of the other teams but we have looked at them we have studied the numbers and we do know some of the facts that we will use
42851 i think so and i think that is fine i think that is good i think that is healthy for us we will find a way somehow in our humble way to utilize all of that
42852 perception is not necessarily reality and i think you have to give us a chance to have our training camp and see where we go
42853 i think we do have a number of players that have played if you just take our young players alone and the experience factor that they had i think that the level of play and the way in which they have upgraded their individual talents and the way we can utilize them is going to put us in a good position right off the bat
42854 i dont think so because i think what my position will be and what i think the team will be ready to accept is the fact that the reason we won was because of team
42855 team over self was why we won the unselfishness that was demonstrated throughout the year the believing in one another the supporting of one another the idea that so many people contributed and that our team one of the things that i was most proud of and i have told you this was that we were not a team that ever really looked backwards we constantly looked forward and that was in the good times and the bad i think that attitude will permeate the position that we find ourselves in this year and i think that with the quality of the individuals that we have the character of our team that they certainly are going to realize that the attitude about believing in one another about supporting one another about the idea of taking the names off the back of the jerseys that is what served us best last year
42856 i am kind of very much aware of those types of things but i dont think that there will be anything that will reflect on the fact that we are super bowl champions
42857 i think you are going to have the normal training camp ups and downs some days are not going to be as good as others and we will try to remind them that we are the world champions and the expectation level is much higher than that i think that is the way we will approach it i think there are a lot of those kinds of words and phrases that people want to throw out there you know defending and all of that stuff and i just say that if you go back to square one successful teams out think out prepare out practice and out play the opponents and that is exactly where the nuts and bolts of getting started again lies it lies in our preparation and if the hearts and minds are in the right spot we can overcome any obstacle and that is where we will start right out again no one ever gave us or anybody else anything and we dont expect it we are not asking for anything and we expect that the only road to the quality football team that we want to be is through this hard work that occurs right now now i will say this we hope that the idea of playing into february providing us with the extra practices and the extra games and those kind of things is going to help us right off the bat with the level of our play in training camp here
42858 i think that i would use the quote that michael used at his retirement press conference when he said that he chose to retire and move on believing that there were others ready to move into his position not only from a playing standpoint but from a standpoint of team leadership
42859 we wish jeremy shockey nothing but the best jeremy shockey is an excellent football player he is an individual who loved the game loved to play the game was a good physical blocker as i said and a guy when he caught the ball and had it in his hands could make things happen
42860 david tyree who had offseason knee surgery would be the guy right off the bat that i would indicate would not practice
42861 but really until we see all the other guys the guys who had the late surgeries the sam madisons the danny clarks we are going to have to wait until we see how those guys come in now we do know because obviously we have worked those guys out and we have ideas about limiting their one a day type thing at least until they prove they can go
42862 i really dont and we will just have to see where his progress is and what the doctors say about that
42863 but i think quickly they will be able to move on
42864 i am fully expecting that mathias will challenge the training people about going only once a day
42865 we have been kind of researching this for quite a while assistant general manager kevin abrams has looked into this for quite some time we worked him out the other day he is in outstanding shape and he is very hungry very anxious to play i think there is some pride involved there is definitely some motivation there
42866 i had to decide which card to play i am a fan i know who you are but brush shoulders with your type regularly so will just ignore you or im brown foreign and dont know you
42867 we define everything that is on the phone you dont want your phone to be like a pc the last thing you want is to have loaded three apps on your phone and then you go to make a call and it doesnt work anymore these are more like ipods than they are like computers
42868 these are devices that need to work and you cant do that if you load any software on them that doesnt mean theres not going to be software to buy that you can load on them coming from us it doesnt mean we have to write it all but it means it has to be more of a controlled environment

42908 monta as de significado en cada palabra de las escrituras
42909 si la biblia tiene m s de un significado no tiene significado alguno
42910 sostengo que las palabras de la biblia se han dado con la intenci n de que tengan un sentido definido y que nuestro objeto principal debe ser el descubrir ese sentido y luego adherirnos r gidamente a l decir que las palabras tienen cierto significado meramente porque son susceptibles de ser estrujadas para hac rselo tener es una manera deshonesta y peligrosa de manejar las escrituras
42911 este plan de interpretaci n abandona y hace a un lado las leyes comunes que rigen al lenguaje exceptuando la biblia a estas personas les es imposible hallar doble sentido en ning n libro tratado ep stola discurso o narraci n jam s escritos publicados o dirigidos por hombre alguno a sus semejantes a menos que lo hiciera como una diversi n con la intenci n de enga ar existen s en todos los idiomas charadas enigmas acertijos frases de doble sentido etc tambi n han abundado los or culos paganos susceptibles de dos interpretaciones pero ni aun entre stos jam s ha habido el designio de que hubiese en realidad m s de un sentido de la ambig edad de lenguaje puede echarse mano y se la ha echado adrede con objeto de mistificar al lector u oyente o con el fin de ocultar la ignorancia del agorero o para conservar su cr dito en medio de posibles contingencias pero esto es enteramente extra o a los asuntos en que se trata de buena fe y donde hasta la sospecha de doble sentido est fuera de lugar ni es posible sin ofensa a la dignidad y santidad de las escrituras suponer que los escritores inspirados sean comparados a autores de acertijos y enigmas o a ambiguos or culos paganos

42949 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
42950 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
42951 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions

42955 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
42956 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
42957 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
42958 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
42959 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
42960 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
42961 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
42962 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
42963 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
42964 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
42965 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
42966 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
42967 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
42968 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
42969 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
42970 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
42971 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
42972 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
42973 in 10 to 12 years we will reach the tipping point

42977 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
42978 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
42979 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
42980 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
42981 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
42982 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
42983 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
42984 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
42985 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
42986 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there

42988 in america you are not playing the race card when you acknowledge a very visible fact trollneequa commented on
42989 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
42990 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
42991 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
42992 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
42993 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
42994 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
42995 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
42996 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
42997 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
42998 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
42999 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
43000 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
43001 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
43002 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
43003 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
43004 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
43005 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
43006 you know life shouldnt be hard its all about connecting and finding a reason for it
43007 how many times has she gotten me involved in things even when ive said no im not doing it
43008 its just something about jaki she has a way of talking people into doing things without them even realizing it
43009 you cant help but get sucked in shes so approachable
43010 my business is my life and im ok with that
43011 i think she would love to have a significant other an equal whos really the key person in her life
43012 she needs someone to share it with because shes accumulated so much and i dont just mean wealth
43013 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
43014 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
43015 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted

43024 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
43025 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
43026 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
43027 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
43028 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
43029 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
43030 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
43031 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
43032 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
43033 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
43034 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
43035 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
43036 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
43037 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
43038 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
43039 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
43040 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
43041 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
43042 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
43043 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
43044 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
43045 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
43046 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
43047 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
43048 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
43049 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
43050 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
43051 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
43052 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
43053 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
43054 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
43055 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
43056 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
43057 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
43058 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
43059 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
43060 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
43061 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
43062 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
43063 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
43064 if the vice president says its do able i believe
43065 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
43066 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
43067 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
43068 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
43069 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
43070 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
43071 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
43072 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
43073 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
43074 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
43075 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
43076 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
43077 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
43078 hes the only naked man that will ever be in my bedroom
43079 an oil man reacting to the largest transfer of wealth in history
43080 mr gores focus is primarily on solar wind and geothermal energy his belief is that a dramatic wholesale transition to these abundant and renewable sources of energy is not just doable but essential
43081 for years rep jay inslee d wash has been frustrated with congress inability to devise a clean energy policy so he decided to do something about it without markups or bills or committees he decided to write a book center for american progress inslee depicts an economic shift necessary to ease america into a clean energy revolution in the book which was released by island press on oct 1 2007
43082 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
43083 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
43084 how the women of the media sell unhappiness and liberalism to the women of america
43085 there is not much that evangelicals have in common with the policies promoted by barack obama
43086 despite his best efforts to court people of faith voters understand the difference between lip service and public service and john mccains record is much more in line with the values of the evangelical community
43087 one thing that it clearly is indicative of this poll is that this nation cares about the christian values and ethics of a candidate for national office and it makes enough difference that the news media reports on it
43088 people of faith have always been involved in the political process they have a patriotic and scriptural obligation to do so it is to be ignored at the candidates peril
43089 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
43090 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
43091 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side

43097 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
43098 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
43099 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
43100 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
43101 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
43102 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
43103 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
43104 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
43105 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
43106 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
43107 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
43108 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
43109 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
43110 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
43111 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
43112 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
43113 climate change is the greatest environmental crisis that humanity has ever faced but it is not the only serious challenge confronting us there is a simultaneous source problem known as peak oil arising from the depletion of the fuels we are burning particularly petroleum the solution to both climate change and peak oil is to develop renewable sources of energy to use less energy to use energy differently and to make this shift as rapidly as possible
43114 al gores ambitious goal provides a national focus and call to action now whats needed is a clear sighted plan for achieving it one that recognizes the complex issues of energy depletion the vulnerability of the supply chain and the limits of technology we are taking up gores call and presenting a powerful framework to realize this vision a vision that would revitalize america and make it genuinely sustainable
43115 al gores generational challenge to repower america which places energy at the forefront of the national agenda should be the top issue debated by all candidates this fall
43116 energy touches almost every critical issue facing our country including the economy security and the environment gores courageous and rational plan to move to 100 renewable energy sources in 10 years has my full support our 10 point plan provides the stepping stones to achieve this target
43117 we thank al gore for articulating the most urgent action needed to safeguard americas environmental economic and societal future and that of the entire world our mission is to get society off of fossil fuels fast and we embrace the need to move to 100 renewable energy with this plan
43118 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
43119 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
43120 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
43121 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
43122 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
43123 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
43124 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
43125 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
43126 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
43127 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
43128 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
43129 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
43130 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
43131 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
43132 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
43133 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
43134 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
43135 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
43136 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
43137 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
43138 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
43139 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
43140 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
43141 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
43142 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
43143 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
43144 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
43145 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
43146 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
43147 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
43148 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
43149 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
43150 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
43151 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
43152 two canaries in the coal mine the first one is in the arctic of course the arctic ocean has a floating ice cap greenland on its side there i say canary in the coal mine because the arctic is one part of the world that is experiencing faster impact from global warming this is the largest ice shelf in the arctic the ward hunt ice shelf it just cracked in half a year ago the scientists were astonished
43153 current coastal temperatures are about 1 c below their 1940 values
43154 at the summit of the greenland ice sheet the summer average temperature has decreased at the rate of 2 2 c per decade since the beginning of the measurements in 1987
43155 colors indicate ice sheet elevation change rate in cm year from satellite altimeter data 1992 2003 the spatially averaged increase is 5 4 0 2 cm year
43156 shut off would imply repeal of the law of conservation of angular momentum widely disseminated and grossly oversimplified pictures showing the ocean as a conveyor belt have misled people into thinking ocean circulation is driven by a sinking motion at high latitudes
43157 our dangerous overreliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
43158 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
43159 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
43160 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
43161 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
43162 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
43163 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
43164 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
43165 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
43166 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
43167 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
43168 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
43169 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
43170 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
43171 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
43172 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
43173 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
43174 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
43175 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
43176 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
43177 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
43178 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
43179 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
43180 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
43181 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
43182 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
43183 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
43184 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
43185 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
43186 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
43187 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
43188 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
43189 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
43190 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
43191 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
43192 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
43193 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
43194 when our children assess what we and our generation did here in this world as they look backward they will ask one of two questions theyll look back and either they will ask what were you thinking didnt you see the glaciers melting didnt you see the deserts growing and the droughts worsening and the crops drying up didnt you see the sea level rising didnt you see the floods didnt you pay attention to what was going on didnt you care what were you thinking
43195 one which i would much prefer them to ask i want them to look back on this time and ask how did you find the moral courage to successfully address the crisis that so many said was impossible to address and when they ask that question i want you to tell them that you saw it as a privilege
43196 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
43197 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
43198 to those who say the challenge is not politically viable i suggest they go before the american people and try to defend the status quo then bear witness to the peoples appetite for change
43199 some of our greatest accomplishments as a nation have resulted from commitments to reach a goal that fell well beyond the next election the marshall plan social security the interstate highway system
43200 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
43201 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
43202 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
43203 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
43204 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
43205 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
43206 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now

43281 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
43282 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
43283 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
43284 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
43285 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
43286 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
43287 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
43288 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

43296 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
43297 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
43298 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
43299 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
43300 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
43301 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
43302 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
43303 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
43304 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
43305 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
43306 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
43307 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
43308 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
43309 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
43310 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
43311 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
43312 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
43313 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
43314 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
43315 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
43316 por que n o trazer pra florian polis o congresso da wttc
43317 p ra a eu tou aqui cheguei antes me respeita
43318 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
43319 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
43320 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
43321 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
43322 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
43323 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
43324 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
43325 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
43326 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
43327 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
43328 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
43329 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
43330 as the election sunk into disaster many republicans had fun recalling the words democrats tossed around during previous gop run elections my favorite quote from the past came courtesy of treacy who took one final slam at sadler as her term ended in january
43331 im sure whatever white does in her first election wont in any way match the years of mistakes republicans have made
43332 on i 485 i was driving home and saw a lightning strike and i said to myself that looks right in my neighorhood
43333 luckily its all material things my wifes ok my dogs ok
43334 moments ah but there is some kernels of truth to the story
43335 that was a riot especially when someone piped up saying he really did need a cobol compiler for the amiga
43336 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
43337 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
43338 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
43339 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
43340 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
43341 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
43342 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
43343 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
43344 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
43345 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
43346 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
43347 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
43348 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
43349 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
43350 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
43351 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
43352 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
43353 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
43354 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
43355 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
43356 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
43357 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
43358 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
43359 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

43412 for almost two thirds of todays retirees social security is their majority source of income and for millions over 65 health insurance would not be affordable without medicare yet all too often pre retirees know less about their social security and medicare benefits than any other piece of their retirement plan its critical that baby boomers do their homework

43417 plastics packaging waste in particular is a very visible part of the waste stream and its also growing
43418 ironically as we become more successful at recycling generally whats left in the bin tends to be just the plastic so more and more people are looking in their bins and saying theres just bits of plastic here why cant i recycle them
43419 a lot of packaging is designed to lengthen the shelf life of the products that are being sold so if you take it out of the packaging theres a good chance that it will actually not last as long

43449 today i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
43450 this is not an action i take lightly but we do not have a budget and as governor i have a responsibility to make sure our state has enough money to pay its bills
43451 im all right except i will continue my therapy because of arthritic pain muscles around the operated area which is normal
43452 i dont want to be presumptuous but i have not lost touch with my friends in the cabinet i have not seen a bunch of workers in government who are working so hard so driven by a president who works even harder than anyone of them so maybe i should do what i can to be of help to them and the president if they need my help
43453 i vehemently deny that he ever asked me what it would take to inhibit myself from the case nor gave any reply in a manner that he stated in the affidavit i never asked for money
43454 he told me that he was sent by manolo lopez who was with him in the car because it was a matter of life and death for them and so they wanted the case to be ensured
43455 and so he pleaded for me to accept what he called a win win situation of p10 million
43456 as initial reaction to the affidavit of francis de borja i find it not only ridiculous but also incredible he has absolutely twisted the facts to suit a wicked end
43457 i had been appalled from the beginning by the way the gsis and the government were going after meralco
43458 ay francis you have no idea of the pressures i am undergoing from the government
43459 he in effect had just given me his motive for wanting to remain as acting chairman of the division
43460 i concluded that this was probably the reason why he was hanging on so desperately to the acting chairmanship of the division if he would give up the said acting chairmanship he would lose his chance for a supreme court seat and the promise of monetary consideration
43461 ermita doesnt seem to know the scope and intent of eo 156 perhaps if his boss knows what is happening a mere subordinate openly disputing her eo she should revoke ermitas post
43462 ay francis you have no idea of the pressures i am undergoing from the government
43463 walang sinasabi sa akin yun pala gusto niyang bumalik why did he not say anything to me parang trinaidor ako
43464 why does he want to come back siguro meron silang gustong gawin dito
43465 what would it take for you to resist the governments offer
43466 we appeal to everyone to respect the subjudice nature of the case and to refrain from public discussion of the merits of the case
43467 nobody asked him to identify the person who supposedly offered him bribe money he also did not offer to disclose the identity of the emissary
43468 he in effect had just given me his motive for wanting to remain as acting chairman of the division i concluded that this was probably the reason why he was hanging on so desperately to the acting chairmanship of the division
43469 recourse through the court of appeals en banc is not an option for gsis to impugn or over the meralco decision
43470 misrepresents themselves and their polls through biased questions and or faulty survey methodology
43471 we are looking to a professional organization such as mores to ensure that the public is not manipulated by such unethical polling practices i would also hope that you will do what you can to call attention to instances where polling organizations fall short of the high professional standards to which your organization and your members subscribe
43472 july 2008 nationwide survey on presidential performance and trust rating

43479 remind the people of tvuuc of the long integrity and of their sense of mission as a congregation and that has always been carried forward in a certain face of violence
43480 sponsored rather quietly the first interracial day camp in the city
43481 the congregation when i was there had all the front windows of the building shot out one sunday night we had just started hosting the metropolitan community church mcc in our space providing them with a place to worship and the shooting took place while teenagers of our church were meeting in the building fortunately downstairs
43482 a group of hooligans arrived and threw formaldehyde into the building
43483 in the 1970s when the violence took place the best thing i knew was to be quiet we would not have gotten sympathy for hosting a gay congregation
43484 for nearly sixty years one distinguishing characteristic of this congregation is that they have retained an integrity of mission regardless of the occasional outbursts of violence in the area they are distinguished by having a very strong sense of why they exist coming out of their history and their own sense of self
43485 some simple ritual to perform that all the people take part in which reclaims this as sacred space

43489 free speech is a right reserved only for those we agree with
43490 you know i dont pay attention to john mccains ads although i do notice he doesnt seem to have anything to say very positive about himself he seems to only be talking about me you need to ask john mccain what hes for and not just what hes against
43491 at this pace the state could be slipping into a severe water crisis if the drought continues
43492 we want to send a strong message that we need to redouble our efforts to conserve
43493 people need to stress their landscaping if we all cut back reserves can be extended
43494 we manage our fiscal business relatively well with a structurally balanced budget
43495 its not complex its simple dont spend more than you make we manage to work within our income
43496 i just want to help schools and serve the community
43497 working with the parent teacher association has taught me the direct value of persevering for an equal education for every child
43498 the pta is the springboard of my passion for education
43499 i hope to see a new student representative at the board meetings soon
43500 mark inspired me to run because he found so much pleasure in public service and he feels hes making a difference
43501 education is all about the relationship between students and teachers so staffing positions must be protected despite budget shortages
43502 its important to have school board members who have children that currently attend local schools
43503 thats usually the first area that is cut but with more collaboration with the community perhaps grants could be obtained to maintain the programs
43504 weve provided leadership and support for teachers so they can get their work done test scores throughout the district have gone up
43505 there are so many things that can be done between the city and schools to reduce costs and enhance operations
43506 our ministry as the ncc isnt possible without the work of local churches
43507 the witness of these congregations day in and day out give an illustration of the faith communitys ability to live in a sustainable way with gods creation
43508 one of the most atrisk cities for the effects of global warming is new orleans and one of the biggest contributors is energy usage
43509 when one person starts something like this then the next thing you know you have a whole group of people
43510 as our reputation for creation care grows so has our congregation which now attracts members from a 20 mile radius
43511 we look forward to the day when we can give jars of honey to visitors
43512 the coaches expect me to take the no 1 role in the backfield
43513 to me its also a role of leadership where before it was more about proving yourself as a younger player its a totally different approach when you lead by example
43514 our quarterbacks can see the whole field at all times
43515 if im worth my salt and the rest of the leaders on this team are worth their salt scott will be up for the heisman in two years that would be awesome and great for colorado football
43516 we have a lot of receivers back we lost three starters on the offensive front and we need to get better
43517 his throws are right on the money it helps when the quarterback and receivers are on the same page
43518 he had surgery to put a pin in his foot the healing process is going as planned hopefully he will be at full speed early on in camp
43519 were definitely going to be counting on him a lot
43520 hes going to have a bigger on his back than hes had in past seasons with mazza being gone but we still expect a huge year
43521 he can be a first team wideout in our league and that game should give him the confidence he needs to do it

43565 through our review of pediatric adverse events we found a 1 55 risk of adverse events occurring in 100 treatments of acupuncture that coincides with the low risk detailed in the studies mentioned previously according to the researchers the actual risk to an individual patient is hard to determine because certain patients such as an immunosuppressed patient can be predisposed to an increased risk acupuncturist s qualifications differ and practices vary in certain parts of the world nevertheless it seems acupuncture is a safe complementary alternative medicine modality for pediatric patients on the basis of the data we reviewed on efficacy from all the conditions reviewed the most extensive research has looked into acupuncture s role in managing postoperative and chemotherapy induced nausea vomiting postoperatively there is far more evidence of acupuncture s efficacy for pediatrics than for children treated with chemotherapy acupuncture seems to be most effective in preventing postoperative induced nausea in children for adults research shows that acupuncture can inhibit chemotherapy related acute vomiting but conclusions about its effects in pediatrics cannot be made on the basis of the available published clinical trials data to date pain has yielded the most convincing results on acupuncture efficacy musculoskeletal and cancer related pain commonly affects children and adults but unfortunately mostly adult studies have been conducted thus far because the manifestations of pain can be different in children than in adults data cannot be extrapolated from adult research systematic reviews have shown that existing data often lack adequate control groups and sample sizes we could not find any well conducted randomized controlled studies that looked at pediatrics and acupuncture exclusively admit the researchers also research so far cannot conclude the usefulness of acupuncture on seasonal allergic rhinitis children afflicted with nocturnal enuresis asthma other neurologic conditions gastrointestinal disorders and addiction acupuncture has been used therapeutically in china for thousands of years and is growing in

work by blocking the action of a certain enzyme chemical in the liver which is needed to make cholesterol statins which control the first step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol have been shown to in rodents both in vitro and in vivo the effect is associated with an increased expression of the bone morphogenetic protein 2 bmp 2 gene in bone cells one of the most critical components of building healing and remodeling bone in humans is a process called osteoinduction bone morphogenetic proteins bmps found in human blood and bones are a group of growth factors and cytokines known for their ability to induce the formation of bone and cartilage bmps have been used to stimulate the production of bone in animals and humans with great success fda has approved the use of bmps for anterior spinal fusion in the lumbar spine and many other clinical trials have found these proteins to be effective in generating bone in other areas of the spine the spine research community is encouraged by bmps and hopes they may someday be the standard for fusion procedures reducing postsurgical pain and improve the effectiveness of spinal surgeries present study done at the university of hong kong rabbits with bone defects created to their parietal bones were grafted with collagen matrix mixed with red yeast rice extract in the control animal two defects were grafted with collagen matrix alone in the control group cells were cultured for three durations 24 hours 48 hours and 72 hours without any intervention in the red yeast rice group cells were cultured for the same durations with various concentrations of red yeast rice extract total protein mitochondrial activity and bone cell formation were measured as a result the test animal showed more formation of new bone in the defects than the control animal the bone formation in bone defects on the animals and increased bone cell formation in vitro the researchers explained that red yeast rice contains monacolins which are a family of hmg coa reductase inhibitors moreover monacolin k is equivalent to the statin known as mevinolin or lovastatin it is the function of the red yeast rice include sterols sitosterol campesterol

research by scientists at england s university of cambridge and ucla suggests their findings appear june 6 in the peer reviewed journal science serotonin has long been associated with social behavior and low levels of anxiety but its precise involvement in impulsive aggression has been controversial though many scientists have hypothesized a link between serotonin and impulsivity this is one of the first studies to show a causal link between the two the findings highlight why some of us may become combative or aggressive when we have not eaten the essential amino acid necessary for the body to create serotonin levels naturally decline when we don t eat the research also provides insight into clinical disorders characterized by low serotonin levels such as depression and obsessive compulsive disorder and may help explain some of the social difficulties associated with these disorders ucla scientists reported in april that the human brain responds to being treated fairly the same way it responds to winning money and eating chocolate being treated fairly turns on the brain s reward circuitry in the new science study they and their cambridge colleagues report that people with low serotonin levels were found to be more sensitive to being treated unfairly the science study involved 20 subjects 14 of them female with an average age of 25 as in the april study published in the journal psychological science participants were presented with fair and insulting offers for dividing sums of money if they declined neither they nor the person making the offer would receive anything some of the offers were fair such as receiving 5 brisith pounds out of 10 or out of 12 while others were unfair such as receiving 5 pounds out of 23 in this study however after initially responding to the offers participants were given a drink that significantly reduced their serotonin levels they were then presented with the offers again serotonin levels were reduced they rejected 82 of the unfair offers when their serotonin levels were normal they rejected only 67 of the unfair offers thus people with low serotonin levels were more likely to reject unfair offers the same person may experience the same thing as fair and unfair on different days based on how the neurochemistry of the brain is functioning said study co author matthew d lieberman ucla associate professor of psychology and a founder of social cognitive neuroscience when we feel something is unfair that may have to do with how our brain causes us to experience the world our subjects are not aware their serotonin levels are affecting the way they experience the world this suggests we should be more forgiving of other people s perspectives a sense of fair play is not a purely rational process he added it seems not to be the case that like a math formula if something is fair it s fair for all time in all situations chinese medicine news 66 150 96 121 chinese medicine news by chinese medicine news is

service at mskcc dr pfister presented the findings at the annual meeting of the american society for clinical oncology neck dissection is a common procedure for treatment of head and neck cancer there are different types of neck dissection which vary based on which structures are removed and the anticipated side effects one type the radical neck dissection involves complete removal of lymph nodes from one side of the neck the muscle that helps turn the head a major vein and a nerve that is critical to full range of motion for the arm and shoulder pain and shoulder mobility problems are common after such surgery adversely affecting quality of life as well as employability for certain occupations said dr pfister nerve sparing and other modified radical techniques that preserve certain structures without compromising disease control reduce the incidence of these problems but do not eliminate them entirely dr pfister adds unfortunately available conventional methods of treatment for pain and dysfunction following neck surgery often have limited benefits leaving much room for improvement seventy patients participated in the study and were randomized to receive either acupuncture or usual care which includes recommendations of physical therapy exercises and the use of anti inflammatory drugs for all of the patients at least three months had elapsed since their surgery and radiation treatments the treatment group received four sessions of acupuncture over the course of approximately four weeks both groups were evaluated using the constant murley scale a composite measure of pain and mobility improved in 39 of the patients receiving acupuncture compared to a 7 improvement in the group that received usual care an added benefit of acupuncture was significant reduction of reported xerostomia or extreme dry mouth this distressing problem common among cancer patients following radiotherapy in the head and neck is addressed with only limited success by mainstream means acupuncture does not work for everyone but it can be extraordinarily helpful for many said dr cassileth it does not treat illness but acupuncture can control a number of distressing symptoms such as shortness of breath acupuncture offered good analgesic effects for patients of late acupuncture at 3 5 of the most severe tender points and a medication group treated with oral administration according to the who three step administration principle i e the patients with mild pain took morphine the results showed that both methods could effectively control acupuncture group

risk by up to 45 according to a review of major scientific data experts recommend dosage of 500mg a day for healthy persons and 1 g for patients with coronary artery diseases cardiovascular benefit docosahexaenoic acid dha and eicosapentaenoic acid epa are found in fish oils the best source for dha and epa are fatty coldwater fish such as herring mackerel salmon and tuna fish oil supplements or algae supplements also can provide omega 3 fatty acids are considered essential fatty acids they are essential to human health but cannot be manufactured by the body for this reason omega 3 fatty acids can be found in fish such as salmon tuna and halibut other marine life such as algae and krill certain plants including purslane and nut oils omega 3 fatty acids play a crucial role in brain function as well as normal growth and development the american heart association recommends eating fish particularly fatty fish such as mackerel lake trout herring sardines albacore tuna and salmon at least 2 times a week there are three major types of omega 3 fatty acids that are ingested in foods and used by the body alpha linolenic acid ala eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha once eaten the body converts ala to epa and dha the two types of omega 3 fatty acids more readily used by the body extensive research indicates that omega 3 fatty acids reduce inflammation and help prevent risk factors associated with chronic diseases such as arthritis these essential fatty acids are highly concentrated in the brain and appear to be particularly important for cognitive brain memory and performance and behavioural function in fact infants who do not get enough omega 3 fatty acids from their mothers during pregnancy are at risk for developing vision and nerve problems symptoms of fatty acid deficiency include extreme tiredness fatigue poor memory dry skin depression and poor circulation thousands of research studies have documented how the oils known as cardiovascular system particularly among people diagnosed with coronary artery disease the incredible volume of research on this topic creates difficulty for many physicians and patients to stay current with findings and recommendations related to these oils cardiovascular health focusing on who benefits most from their protective effects recommended guidelines for administration and dosing and possible adverse effects associated with their use author james okeefe m d a cardiologist from the mid america heart institute in kansas city mo cites the results of several large trials that demonstrated the positive benefits associated with omega 3 fatty acids either from oily fish or fish oil capsules omega 3 fatty acids comes from three large controlled trials of 32 000 participants randomized to receive fatty acid supplements containing dha and epa or to act as controls
43566 these trials showed reductions in cardiovascular events of 19 to 45 overall these findings suggest that intake of dietary sources or fish oil supplements should be increased especially in those with or at risk for coronary artery disease

43581 suddenly there was this raucous incredibly loud noise it was unbelievable the noise that was being produced we really had no idea where it was coming from originally until it settled down afterwards and we realized there had been a rock slide
43582 we actually did not hear those windows break thats how loud the noise was until we pulled over and were able to examine the vehicle afterwards
43583 it was as close as it could be without dying basically
43584 it was really a matter of seconds a few seconds later and the rocks would have been piled on top of us
43585 it seems like this really is mother nature saying im the boss here and youre trying to build in a tricky area and there are risks to it
43586 the rock is reasonably good quality but it rises very steeply from the sea and it is cut by a special type of joint cracks which happen to incline out of the slope so blocks can slide over them and that has been a problem ever since the construction of the highway
43587 if you ran the olympics 500 times one of those times the highway would be cut with a rock fall
43588 im concerned because its really the lifeline it really affects our lives and our businesses

43595 they were very brave they reacted swiftly calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
43596 stop the bus somebodys getting stabbed everyone get the hell off
43597 they returned to the back of the bus to find that the person who was stabbing the person in the neck had now sawed off the head of the victim
43598 he cut the victims head off and then walked up to the door holding it and just looked at them crazy like and then dropped the head and walked back to the body and started cutting it some more

43604 based on our estimates by the companies paying these fines they will not be making any profits out of the illicit activities they had in the past
43605 the result weve seen today brings to a close a significant chapter in contraband tobacco history
43606 the message sent today is that no company is above the law
43607 we realize we are going to take a hit to our reputation because of this
43608 we acknowledge we violated this section of the excise act
43609 imperial is paying 600 million and benson and hedges is paying 550 million when you add up the criminal and civil fines

43701 resolvemos que dichos predios son bienes patrimoniales susceptibles de apropiaci n particular
43702 el departamento de justicia en su funci n ministerial har una evaluaci n de la determinaci n judicial pero lo m s importante en este momento es que los extremos con inter s en esta controversia reconozcan que han sido escuchados
43703 esto no significa que el caso haya concluido la opini n se refiere a que los terrenos no son de dominio p blico pero deja la puerta abierta a posibles violaciones de ley hacia eso la evidencia entregada a justicia
43704 la muy acertada decisi n del tribunal basada en el derecho devuelve la credibilidad a los procesos de permisos
43705 no creo que sea motivo de celebraci n creo que es motivo de reflexi n aqu lo nico que ha pasado es que se ha confirmado que injustamente hemos manchado no el proyecto sino la imagen de puerto rico como un lugar certero para venir a hacer una inversi n confiable

43707 avalar la novel teor a esgrimida por el estado en este caso colocar a en una precaria situaci n a miles de hogares localizados en algunas de las zonas m s caracter sticas de la zona metropolitana no podemos actuar en abstracci n de esa realidad
43708 los permisos administrativos no confieren titularidad y mucho menos pueden convalidar un acto nulo de enajenaci n de bienes de dominio p blico
43709 los fundamentos discutidos me han convencido que estos son bienes de dominio p blico y no son susceptibles de tr fico jur dico
43710 el tribunal decidi conforme a derecho confirma lo que otro tribunal hab a dicho y es bien importante que constitucionalmente hablando se expres la autoridad a la que el pueblo deleg decidir decisiones como estas
43711 todos debemos continuar respaldando a nuestro sistema judicial y no debemos montar estructuras alternas o seudojudiciales para que decidan conforme a los gustos personales

43715 you need to ask john mccain what hes for not just what hes against
43716 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
43717 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
43718 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
43719 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
43720 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
43721 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
43722 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
43723 the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
43724 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
43725 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
43726 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault

43732 he mofaz urged the americans to set firm conditions such as a refusal to allow the iranians to enrich uranium on their turf and to be clear that the deadline must be preserved the iranians are simply looking for cracks to exploit

43734 we also reaffirmed our strong mutual determination to counter irans support for terrorism
43735 its very personal with a father and son theme loosely based on his own life
43736 the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
43737 once weve had a chance to do that well consider whether the decision should be appealed
43738 i have long pointed out that this administrations claims of executive privilege and immunity which white house officials have used to justify refusing to even show up when served with congressional subpoenas are wrong
43739 todays landmark ruling is a ringing reaffirmation of the fundamental principle of checks and balances and the basic american idea that no person is above the law

43775 we came away with wonderful ideas and books to guide us in this ministry

43777 the service provides the opportunity for the congregation to celebrate the gifts and contributions of older adults and it is loved by the entire congregation
43778 we survey them once a year and ask what types of programs and speakers are of interest
43779 i have a catholic friend who has no relatives in town no way to drive and no way to pay
43780 but they always pick her up and include her in all the outings and meals free of charge i think its great that they reach out to others outside of the church its food for the body and the soul
43781 we always provide a meal with our programs and activities and we carry lunches to those who cant make it

44361 found nearly all of the same problems and deficiencies that had been reported one year previously
44362 theyre certainly very dramatic and they certainly are documents that we will have to spend a lot of time looking at
44363 the reality is that kbrs actions were not the cause of any of these terrible accidents
44364 i think that the army has some responsibility in this
44365 well if they have some who would have the rest
44366 just conceivably who else could have it if the army just has some responsibility would kbr have some then
44367 but despite these warnings few actions were taken by pentagon leadership or kbr officials
44368 a genuine danger to our men and women serving in iraq
44369 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
44370 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
44371 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
44372 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
44373 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
44374 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
44375 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
44376 the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
44377 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
44378 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
44379 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
44380 left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed
44381 whats at stake here goes to the very core of the values of the military and the nation itself
44382 i just cant make any money unless i violate international law
44383 we would undermine the u s mission here because they are so reliant on contractors
44384 i dont think we should worry about a market collapse so to speak theres simply too much money to be made
44385 from a relief and reconstruction perspective one of the most critical issues under discussion is contractor immunity
44386 existing agreements provide u s contractors in iraq with blanket immunity from prosecution under iraqi law but the government of iraq is seeking to modify if not eliminate that immunity such action would acutely affect the status of private security contractors in iraq
44387 appropriated more than 50 billion in taxpayer dollars for iraqs reconstruction
44388 i am confident the iraqi government and the u s government for whom we work will come to some sort of an agreement that will represent both of their interests
44389 were standing by for direction from our u s government clients
44390 clearly if you cant use american security contractors then you will have to use other contractors
44391 a lot of lead time to figure out whats going on here this isnt something new
44392 youve got around 190 000 private military contractors out there doing all sorts of roles everything from armed security work to logistics and running base operations and things like that they work for all sorts of hundreds of different companies and again theyre coming from around the world
44393 you may well see some companies decide they want to leave but theyre going to evaluate whats in their own interests and other companies are going to decide whats in their own interest this is i would argue a good thing because its trying to take iraq and turn it into what is a more natural setting where that government is in charge of the operations of whats happening on the ground from a legal standpoint
44394 youve still got remnants of the insurgents out there youve still got the thieves so youve still got to have convoy security
44395 its like putting a police officer in the middle of folsom prison on murderers row with five guys he put away
44396 are you going to come over here and count this haul with me or not
44397 look im sorry if youre having i dont know moral issues or whatever
44398 whats done is done weve got enough money here to buy just about anything short of a time machine so you might as well just suck it up because theres no going back now so lets look toward the future huh yeah
44399 im going out im going to spend my money if youre lucky ill be back later on
44400 now i want you to pick up all of this money and i want you to put it in my suitcase here then i want you to kiss my feet and say god bless you sir and then well go from there
44401 whats yours is yours and thats all there is to it
44402 damn it what did i say stop being so formal all the time in my book in laws is as good as blood you got me
44403 im not here to render legal advice to your committee
44404 contributed to the analysis or assisted in the drafting of the august 1 2002 interrogation memo
44405 no i didnt say i had nothing to do with it
44406 advocated what was considered the memos most radical claim that the president may authorize any interrogation method even if it crosses the line into torture
44407 a so called principals meeting in which vice president cheney sat around with other cabinet level officials to approve specific interrogation techniques
44408 it doesnt mean one did or didnt occur i certainly wasnt at one
44409 i was not at a meeting that fits the description youve given
44410 i cant answer the question because of the guidance of the department of justice

44413 senyor zapatero el seu discurs s com una erecci matutina al principi promet molt per al final sempre sensorra
44414 its simply not possible for any cabinet officer to be completely aware of and micromanage the activities of staffers particularly where they dont inform him of whats going on
44415 political considerations should play no part in the hiring of career officials at the department of justice
44416 may have been influenced in part based on political considerations
44417 with respect to selection of immigration judges he believed in complete good faith that they were not career civil service positions and that political criteria could be taken into account
44418 the conduct described in this report does not occur again at the department
44419 it is crucial that the american people have confidence in the propriety of what we do and how we do it and i will continue my efforts to make certain they can have such confidence
44420 it is now clear that these politically rooted actions were widespread and could not have been done without at least the tacit approval of senior department officials
44421 the report also indicates that monica goodling kyle sampson and alberto gonzales may have lied to the congress about these matters i have directed my staff to closely review this matter and to consider whether a criminal referral for perjury is needed
44422 getting us closer to the truth of the serious matters we have been investigating

44431 there was a bloodcurdling scream i was just reading my book and all of a sudden i heard it
44432 it was like something between a dog howling and a baby crying i guess you could say
44433 i dont think it will leave me for a while
44434 what you saw and what you experienced would shake the most seasoned police officer and yet im told that each of you acted swiftly calmly and bravely
44435 everybody got off the bus me and a trucker that stopped and the greyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still alive or we could help or something like that
44436 and when we all got up we saw that the guy was cutting off the guys head when he saw us he came back to the front of the bus told the driver to shut the door he pressed the button and the door shut but it didnt shut in time and the guy was able to get his knife out and take a swipe at us
44437 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
44438 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
44439 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
44440 we will do whatever is required to help them and that includes counseling
44441 i dont think we should treat religion lightly mr gore
44442 image quality of our outdoor images was very pleasing and the optio w60 performs just as well indoors as is did out it is an easy to use and very versatile go anywhere camera overall we found that shooting performance and image quality were great for a camera in this class

44449 on november 28 2004 while on patrol in iraq i was wounded by an ied i lost some
44450 i sold personal belongings on e bay and tried to find work for the first time in my life i had bill collectors calling me i felt incredible shame and anger that i wasnt able to provide for my family and i was afraid of losing everything i had worked for the day i called csah was the best move i have made for my family the coalition has given us the chance to keep our home and because of all the people out there who donate to this incredible organization we have time to find the solution
44451 we really want to be as green as we possibly can be
44452 you have to have a balance between the environment and economic development something has to be done for the humans too
44453 florida crystals is a leader in the industry with new technology
44454 the environmental community tends to see sugar as one unitary thing and it isnt really
44455 i dont think we were the only ones who changed
44456 peoples consciousness of the environment in every country in the world let alone the united states has changed and developed were all changing as time goes by
44457 u s sugar could have done the same thing when they built their new mill
44458 the company has always operated on the principle that its bottom line is most important
44459 we cannot respond to conjecture or assumptions at this point about a potential acquisition still under negotiation
44460 and i dont think anyone has gone through and crunched the numbers on what the lowest cost is whether its trading land with the fanjuls or building on the current u s sugar footprint
44461 we want to be an active participant playing a role in how it should be done
44462 is that they do things properly in an orderly way
44463 just a news item from last week family of five goes climbing in the alps

44488 the other day i walked into a museum and in a deserted dusty room at the back saw shelves and shelves of objects that the catalogue called books i nearly died laughing these were huge and cumbersome things that smelled of mildew instead of instantly accessible files that my e reader could access within seconds my curiosity was aroused i just had to know where these things came from and what their purpose was in a spirit of adventure i lifted one of these strange objects out of its place on the shelf and hefted it across to one of the easy chairs in the window i admit to being baffled at first how did one switch it on while exploring its surface i found the lid could be lifted and inside was an actual sheet of paper you remember paper dont you this paper was marked up as if it were the first page of an e book with title author publisher and all the usual information lifting that sheet of paper revealed yet another laying below bearing the markings that one would expect to see on the second page of an e book what a novel idea someone must have spent days coming up with such an amusing burlesque even stranger the reverse side of the paper also bore writing but i found it very inconvenient to twist my head to one side to read it eventually because i became quite engrossed in the exploration i found that the lid of the book could be laid on its back beside the rest and the reverse sides of the pages read almost as easily as one could read the first i did find it very inconvenient in that in this configuration the device took up considerable space on my lap and required me to turn my head from side to side to follow the lines the typeface was also rather quaint and quite tiny to read no matter how much i searched the book i never could find the control that changed the size of the font i suppose you might be interested in the subject of this so called book it turned out to be a volume of an encyclopedia and the rest of the objects on its shelf were successive volumes of something called a set since the publication date i discovered tucked into an obscure corner informed me that this was a relic from the earliest years of the twenty first century i found it a remarkable window on an ancient era hardly any of its entries had information we would consider reliable today and it eventually dawned on me that the reason must be the lack of any wiki function in this ancient publication system preventing it from being updated with current information and scholarship i must have spent several hours in that musty old room and during that time i exchanged that first volume for several of the others to see what differences they might show me actually they all seemed to follow a format identical with the first i began to lose interest when i realized i could much more conveniently read one of the many modern encyclopedias accessible with my own e reader and peruse up to date information i did see other shelves in a far corner that held slightly smaller books of the same primitive type and was able to read that one seemed to be a copy of a novel becoming more familiar with the nature of these so called books i was able to open it while standing at the shelf but it seemed to be no more than a text version of the story no video versions no actor interpreting the text aloud no link to scholarly analysis and no reviews the experience of taking it to the window to pore over didnt promise to be rich enough to be worth the effort i had to ask one of the museum staff about my discovery as i left she agreed that it was an almost forgotten corner of the museum and took up space that could be employed to better purpose but she told me that it was their contribution to historical research and that every year or two some scholar would spend a day or more uncovering some obscure facts useful for footnotes in scholarly journals well i guess it takes all kinds
44489 aliss go and find the colonel and tell him i am free for the discussion he requested
44490 sit here beside me do you have needlework to do no would you like one of my pieces
44491 im afraid ive never learned needlework my lady not a skill of mine
44492 you cannot sew and you dress like a ploughboy dear me how will you ever find a husband
44493 im the youngest woman among my company im more concerned not to let any of the men get too close theyre all far too old to suit me
44494 nonsense that commander ascher seems a fine man hes not married is he
44495 pshaw a man of thirty is in his prime you are too fussy by far young lady would you prefer a mere boy like my son his head full of nothing but horses and tournaments
44496 your son seems fine too but perhaps a tad too young
44497 he is and his father has a cousin in mind for him what are your fathers plans do you have an eligible cousin
44498 our relatives are far away and no longer accessible even my mother
44499 there there its a sad thing for a girl to lose the guidance of her mother but what is the status of your family in your own society does your father have an inherited title
44500 except in a few lands we have few inherited titles some years ago there were excesses and conflicts the solution to those difficulties was to allow only the honors and acquisitions that a man or woman could gain in their own lifetime
44501 indeed and how do the lower orders know their place
44502 well there are no lower orders in theory status is gained by advanced education and professional attainments my father is the director of our engineering department based on his phd and his accomplishments i suppose calling him dr matah is equivalent to a knights title
44503 but how does your king account for his legitimacy a ruler must come from a long and noble lineage
44504 the head of our society is called a secretary general and is chosen from among all the representatives of the nations the person retains office for eight years and then another is chosen the hope is that we get the guidance of the wisest among us that way when we left the secretary general was a woman of great distinction
44505 may the holy flame preserve us a woman id suggest you not spread that knowledge too widely about
44506 be careful young mistress or youll tumble down the steps
44507 ow i think my ankle is twisted may i prevail upon you to help me down those slippery steps
44508 im alone sir except for my boats crew i hope you will not judge me forward for speaking
44509 i presume you are yakob felger the master here im lieutenant gisel matah of iskander security lieutenant chronon and i undertook to bring your son home through the city tonight
44510 how do i know you are competent have you not done enough harm
44511 i didnt shoot at your son ask commandante zagdorf about that as for what im doing ill do a better job than any of lingdons churgeons with their potions and leeches now let me have some room to work
44512 youre feeling shock i dont think the ball hit the bone it will heal quickly can you hold this gauze over the wound
44513 we undertook to protect your son from criminals in the night we didnt expect them to be wearing the emperors insignia
44514 you ruffians are entirely responsible for what has occurred how dare you accuse the emperor
44515 id think youd be concerned your legitimate rights to do business here have been violated
44516 i will make up my own mind how i should concern myself
44517 it is as these friends say father i went out to investigate their business request and the empires soldiers attacked us twice
44518 friends i did not give you permission to attend any secret meetings i will speak to you later
44519 i admit we acted behind your back but only because commandante zagdorf killed our friend bertzin
44520 nothing that would hold up in a court of law surely whats happened here tonight is evidence enough do the felgers have freedom to do business or does the emperor keep you on a leash
44521 the felgers have freedom to pursue their legitimate business in the kingdom of lingdon i understood the iskander proposal to go further did not bertzin report that i preferred dealing with the emperor i revere and respect over some chance enterprise of disreputable upstarts you had your answer why do you persist
44522 thanks if i can return the favour these troublemakers for example id be pleased to help you
44523 i dont think you need trouble yourself about them major
44524 actually i may want to trouble myself as you say
44525 im not sure how much im authorized to tell you but iskander has an agent infiltrated into a radical group what if hes here it would be a blow to our operation if you arrested him hung him even
44526 i dont have definite information i merely think his presence a strong possibility but we cant afford to have anything happen to him
44527 yes i see that but i have to stop their meeting
44528 what about placing some person of your own in the meeting learn more about the ringleaders
44529 if i had such a man i would consider that i have very few good people wouldnt want to have ones throat slit
44530 when have i ever been wise i think a young woman could infiltrate the group more easily than a man they do have women involved
44531 yes some garment workers in the factory set up with iskanders new textile machines they have complained about their pay cheeky little bitches if they dont like it then let them stay at home with their children
44532 i run into those feelings all the time id like to stay at home to be yohans helpmate as well but i dont have the choice these women may not either if they are widowed from the war and trying to feed their children
44533 i suppose i had not thought of it that way

44552 nos corresponde pronunciarnos aqu en su m rito y mientras no exista un cambio radical en este sistema de transporte no es viable y la alianza no estar dispuesta a dar sus votos para financiar un saco roto un proyecto que no tiene ninguna viabilidad esta es una criatura que nace con una malformaci n cong nita y mientras el gobierno no asuma eso no hay mucho que hablar
44553 porque nos parece que es m s de los mismo nosotros creemos que el gobierno ha sido incapaz de controlar el d ficit de definirlo de cuantificarlo de anticiparlo y sobretodo de reconocer el fracaso del transatiago nosotros no nos vamos a prestar adem s para que se juegue con las regiones y para que se le d una compensaci n que tampoco resuelve los problemas que tiene el transporte p blico en otras ciudades
44554 el d ficit no se explica solamente por una tarifa que equivocadamente se defini en 380 el d ficit se explica porque la demanda estuvo mal calculada porque los ingresos siguen siendo insuficientes porque los costos se les dispararon porque todo se dise mal por eso hablamos que este es un sistema inviable

44563 they watched the espn outdoors tv show from last year they know how to fish and they have the confidence to do it
44564 there were about five elite series boats sitting on it
44565 i had to move around but i think i can catch them every day
44566 as rough as it was out there today anything can happen
44567 i really struggled to catch anything decent if the wind would let us fish it would be amazing what wed catch these fish are in deep water and schooled in small spots its hard to stay on them in this wind
44568 it wasnt too smooth out there ive been thinking about that all day
44569 ive been fizzing fish on erie for about 20 years
44570 this is the only time i work on live release boats
44571 you dont want the water from the harbor its no good
44572 the one thing people might not know about lake erie is how big the smallmouth can get
44573 the fish could have swam under my legs i had so much water in the boat
44574 ive fished all over the world and ive never seen a smallmouth bass fishery like this
44575 this is truly the best smallmouth fishery in the world
44576 i only fished three hours i had several boat problems im happy with that

44593 fraudulent substitution of urine which is a form of tampering with the doping control process
44594 we wont put a test out there if were not ready to defend it
44595 every year we think the labs and the testing are getting better but then along come the olympics and we find things we never expected
44596 itd be lovely to have no positives but thats not likely to happen and even if there are less positives you wonder is it because were doing a better job or because theyve found something new
44597 you can still have two strikes and hit a home run
44598 its that off season training this strength base that serves them months later during the competitive season

44604 she didnt get the chance to choose what she wanted with her life
44605 my family and i deserve to know why but have to accept we may never get an answer and can only wonder if it was for the fun of it
44606 the only thing that would bring satisfaction is to have tania restored to us
44607 there was never any intention to insult paula wriedt and any suggestion to the contrary is grossly unfair

44633 i promised myself i was not going to move just for that gm position
44634 when i did move it would be for the right one and this is the right one
44635 steve is the strongest candidate in hockey at the executive level that wasnt a gm
44636 we realize there are more and more demands in this business at this level in order to get the job done you need many people doing it
44637 i was going to make some fairly significant changes anyways

44640 its a lot more focused on the corporate and high end markets
44641 well still sell intel because theyre quite high end but chenbro provides more specialty
44642 dns patching has probably slowed down because the procedure effectively requires customer facing dns servers to be segregated from the domain hosting servers
44643 most isps dont segregate the servers because it is cheaper and easier to keep them in one box there has not been a compelling reason to segregate them until now which is probably why it is taking some isps a long time to secure themselves
44644 a hacker could make a fake bank web site find a vulnerable resolver and poison its cache so that customers using that resolver are directed to the fake address instead of the bank web site
44645 the bank is aware of situation and we are quite comfortable as we have the tools in place to monitor the situation which complement our existing capability in both hawk i and two factor authentication
44646 the major it vendors have also taken appropriate steps by introducing patches to counteract this problem so we will continue to monitor the environment for any anomalies

44692 you cannot leave yet my raven we have more to do

44710 potassium oxide tom and jerry the rugrats amigos para siempre hey i love that song

44792 thats right big boy try to fight back im telling you to

44795 i think you need to get some treatment ill go get the first aid kit
44796 i dont know why she would do that i love her so sniff much and id never do anything like that to her do you think she doesnt love me any more
44797 i think theres somethin weird about her i mean ive always thought that but now i feel it especially i also think shes getting too close to tobias i feel like theyve gotten into some kind of deep friendship i mean shes interested in things yknow mysterious things so i suppose it aint too hard to believe that she likes him
44798 i regret to inform you my raven but your boyfriend broke your arm
44799 i do not know why either my raven just that well he got angry with you and broke your arm or so i heard
44800 i didnt do anything he forgave me for squeezing his claw why would he
44801 do not worry about your arm my raven i shall heal it for you
44802 i dont remember anything i dont remember this happening to me i dont know why hed ever dream of hurting me
44803 i dont believe what he well im not going to punish him
44804 thankfully tobias healed my arm for me but that doesnt mean that im going to let you off
44805 i never want to see you ever again i dont want to hear you smell you or sense you in any way im sick of you and your stupidity and i deserve better than you i dont know why i ever loved you in the first place youre so stupid and ugly and lots of other stuff that i cant even think of so go away and leave me alone you can jump off a bridge for all i care go to hell why dont you
44806 er cmon krusha if shes gonna talk to ya like that then you dont need her just forget about her huh
44807 your girlfriend hasnt just screamed things like that in your face this is all your fault you know
44808 if you hadnt told me to fight back i wouldnt have broken her arm in the first place
44809 if you hadnt broken her arm youd have been killed
44810 id rather have been killed than have lost the one i love i hate you
44811 youve just lost my most precious thing in my life for me im really gonna get you for that
44812 tobias i have to know about the photograph i dont remember much from last night but i remember the photograph of king k rool and his wife why did you want it
44813 i needed to know if crystal still had her scale patterns when they were married
44814 scale patterns like the stripes on my arm well theyve gone now but i had stripes on my arm
44815 she was very powerful with this black magic she took the powers but she had too much good in her heart to be taken over completely the patterns on her body lasted for a short while but then they vanished she was really cheating the magic everything in life has its good points and bad points advantages and disadvantages but she didnt have any of the disadvantages because she was so kind and good and strong willed she was too good to have evil take over her
44816 clearly i had a lot of blackness in my heart and the evil easily took over me to make me complete i had what i wanted i wanted to have some kind of strength and since i was too feeble to work out and get physical strength mental strength was the best i could get
44817 where did you first i mean how did you first get this magic
44818 well from when i was just a kid i loved magic i went to as many magic shows as i could and i liked finding out how each trick was done but every time i discovered the secrets of each act the magic was gone and it became plain old trickery instead i was convinced that magic existed and i was intent on proving it to the whole world so there was a little magic shop that i went to visit every day when possible all the things in that shop were expensive so id save up my money to buy magic books and little do it yourself magic sets boy i had fun with those i entertained my dad with those tricks my mother never had time for me i knew something bad was going to happen my parents separated and i chose to stay with my father ever since that happened when i was five i never saw my mother again but i remember what she looked like that was all i had left of her a memory anyway i lived with my dad for a few years and he finally found that he was lonely he stopped going to work every day and went looking for a girlfriend instead he still had plenty of time for me and as i grew older the tricks i could do became more impressive i spent more time in the magic shop and i skipped school to go and talk to the old lizard who owned the shop he felt that i had real potential and that i could become a famous magician someday
44819 anyway when i got home from the magic store one day i found my dad and another female lizard on the sofa
44820 i knew at that moment that hed found someone else and i was not going to cope with it very well so i ran straight back to the magic store and told the old lizard everything that lizard was such a good friend he always listened to me he told me that if ever i needed someone to talk to i could just go to him he lived in the shop so hed be there at any time and im glad he was i went to visit him every day sometimes with a problem and sometimes without he became more of a father to me than my real dad and i was never going to call this new female lizard my mother not in a million years
44821 my dad got married to his new girlfriend and i hated her even more she was so perfect so polite she was one of those creatures that makes you think that their motto is i love everyone arent i perfect god i really hated her for being so nice if ever i wanted to show a new trick to my dad shed offer to watch as well so i stopped my magic i only spoke magic with the old lizard and then one day i heard that this o so perfect female lizard was expecting a baby and i really flipped i spent the next few days crying my eyes out in the magic store when i reached my early twenties things were even worse neither my dad nor the other female lizard seemed to be interested in me all they were interested in was their son their precious son oh isnt he so perfect
44822 ruck was that his name ruck the rock one with black hair
44823 spot on raven ruck bloody ruck o so wonderful ruck
44824 you already said beautiful tobias and its crystal youre talking about right
44825 she was just fine with it but she developed her powers much quicker than i and she eventually became more powerful than me
44826 youre saying that crystal had a new love i think youve led yourself to think that you were her old love
44827 after she got married i hated to call her crystal rool i still do i would call her crystal dana which was her name before she got married i addressed her as crystal rool when i gave you the velociraptor blade simply because i felt you would only know her by that name i hated to think of her with this new love stupid stupid stupid but she was so strong that i couldnt do anything about it she was the only lizard who could ever over power me with her black magic and i think that given more time you will become more powerful than i my raven
44828 anyway as i said about this magic there are advantages and disadvantages advantages if youre weak and feeble the magic will give you a form of strength to use in attack and defence you become faster more agile and somewhat more intelligent you can teleport yourself move objects by staring at them transform into animals see parts of the future and the past and read others minds your claws grow longer and you can learn to use a velociraptor blade you can also control the feelings of others to make them feel hate or sadness in an instant you can also gain some physical strength although usually only if it is to be used to cause suffering to others disadvantages if you become too involved as i have your body becomes taken over by the evil and you lose your soul unless you have a very strong mind your scales and the rest of your body will change in appearance to become quite frightening and distinctive you lose certain abilities some of those are the abilities to love and feel happiness hate is the main feeling you possess you cant undo the magic and can end up hating yourself every now and again you get a terrible feeling in your head and stomach mainly you have to throw up usually and the feeling of pain sometimes lasts for hours i cannot describe how awful it is and you sometimes have dreadful feelings of anger when you could just rip someones guts out for as much as looking at you
44829 i eventually felt so sick of myself and the magic that i entered one of those killing sprees i killed the old lizard who gave me the book and that wasnt enough so i returned home and killed my parents i didnt even realise i was doing all this its as though youre entering a dream and when you wake up you find several dead bodies around you until you see the bloody blade in your claw you wonder who on earth could have done such a terrible thing i was completely in the dark as to what happened when i suddenly woke up and found that id just murdered my father and mother to be more specific i had broken his neck and ripped her stomach out those are two manoeuvres that i practise often they are both very useful i do believe that ruck escaped i didnt find his body anywhere im guessing that hes out there somewhere but i really dont give a damn about him i dont even care enough to find out if hes alive or not i could find out just by thinking about him to see if hes there but i cant be asked
44830 stand up my raven i will show you how to use this blade
44831 er im not over enthusiastic about getting my guts ripped out
44832 no i shall just demonstrate on you without hurting you i cant promise you many things raven but ill promise you this
44833 i promise that i will never hurt you it has meant a lot to me that youre willing to spend time with me i promise that i wont ever bring any harm to you
44834 very well anyway you dig the blade in as far as possible and then rip it up their stomach ending the ripping whenever you please i often choose to stop once i reach the rib cage and of course this blade can be used for various other things you can stab it right into someones chest if you want so many possibilities but the two i just showed you are my personal favorites
44835 you said that you can control my emotions how i feel
44836 if ever i wish to yes and why do you ask
44837 you made me didnt you you made me throw that anger fit at krusha
44838 tobias whats the bloomin point of making me angry at my boyfriend is it because you want me to love you instead
44839 if you must know i hate to see couples in love
44840 you cant mess with love tobias if you keep doing these horrible things to me youre going to end up in a worse state than before what goes around comes around you know
44841 fine go back to your dunce of a boyfriend see if i care
44842 i was wrong to ever think that you had a good heart
44843 krusha i im sorry i didnt mean to i mean tobias
44844 i thought youd never talk to me again i mean after all you said but im happy what am i saying im not just happy im happy
44845 oh good im so sorry but i krusha you can let go if you dont im sure to choke before i can apologise any more
44846 he can control how i feel and he doesnt like the way you and i love one another
44847 he cant feel love himself whenever he sees a couple in love he really wants to break them apart i bet thats why he hates king k rool so much for a start king k rool was in love mistake number one with crystal mistake number two and since and since khris was her son oh lord hes gonna want to get back at both of them i can tell and they wont stand a chance
44848 i can duh protect king k rool and khris can take care of himself
44849 tobias is nobody stands a chance against him not even someone with biceps the size of watermelons only crystal had a chance tobias said that i might even stand a chance i guess im the only one who can do anything isnt that fabulous hmph no
44850 halt state your business with king k rool at once
44851 my business with your king is none of your business
44852 get out of here while im in a good mood
44853 ah yes i see you were involved in a small unimportant conversation with that little brat of yours
44854 ah of course the little brat of a son that you and crystal had together how sickening
44855 dont you speak to me or my son like that
44856 whatever makes you say that how could i possibly disgust anyone
44857 she never even liked you if she ever intended to like you it was only to make me jealous
44858 how do you know it isnt i know all and what i say goes do not question it
44859 why dont you leave and let me get on with my life what difference does it make about what happened crystals dead you idiot
44860 and you should have called a doctor when she said that she felt ill thats what i would have done but instead you let her die a slow painful death in the arms of whom she thought she loved
44861 i dont know what you are talking about but youd better shut that mouth of yours before i
44862 do you even know why she went home with you from that party that party where you met her
44863 she was at a party kevin she probably had some kind of fever when she went to sit by you maybe she was taking drugs or something maybe she was drunk it was a party
44864 it was either that or you forced her to go home with you why else would she have done nothing to stop you
44865 i bet you raped her didnt you thats why you disgust me i know very well what you and her did as soon as you reached your home and it makes me sick you must have forced her into it ill bet that stupid son of yours was a mistake too an accident you just wanted pleasure from her
44866 i wont its the truth i can tell from the way youre acting why else would an intelligent young female make love to you you big fat loser
44867 get the heck in here you three take this lizard out of my sight
44868 why would someone like her ever waste her time on you or maybe she did it because you had money how could anyone ever love a guy like you
44869 its clear that youve never loved anyone yourself tobias or you would know that cupids arrow can strike in strange places you would know that love is blind
44870 i know that love is blind i mean why else would she have gone near a bed with you she must have been as blind as a bloody bat
44871 get him out of here before i tear him to shreds get out out out and tobias youre well and truly fired
44872 im glad crystal never needed to waste her time with you so neither will i farewell for now
44873 i dont know i i didnt want you to hear any of those things that tobias said
44874 you werent a mistake son your mother and i wanted to have you you werent an accident she loved you and i love you
44875 ill tell you one day but i want you to know that i didnt force her into anything i loved her very much and she loved me and we both loved you and youre extra special to me now because youve got part of your mother inside you she was so excited when she knew she was expecting you and ever since day one she seemed certain that you would be a boy and she was right i love you
44876 once you find someone you love remain faithful to her and dont just ignore it if theres a bad word said against her some of us need protection from the ones we love
44877 yes krusha has arrived so kindly put the phone down and get back to whatever you were doing goodbye kudgel
44878 he called me goodness i told him about tobias he said it dont matter if hes black or white and then he of course burst into song hes good but oh well i mean it doesnt matter if tobias is black or white it wouldnt matter if he was blue with green polka dots at least kremlings dont usually judge one another on color at least not as much as humans do a black human isnt a bad human im so glad to be a kremling
44879 yeah me too but duh what are we going to do about tobias
44880 i dont know dont let him know youre afraid krusha hell be even worse to you if you do
44881 steady big guy i dont know where exactly he is but im not going to let him hurt you if he wants you hell have to kill me first
44882 dis is real bad navigator sometin awfuls gonna happen real soon
44883 unlike them we can afford to have bad things happen to us were already dead weve got to help
44884 im going to try to find the light switch okay im sure that as soon as we get some light the whole situation will look brighter
44885 no i i dont want you wandering around in the dark on your own please let me come with you
44886 fine you can come if you want just stick close by me okay i dont want to lose you in the dark
44887 when i said stick by me i didnt ask you to get that close
44888 well i er dont wanna get lost you dont mind me holding onto you do you
44889 not at all now where is that switch do you have any idea
44890 if this was the first laura bow game we might be about to discover a mans body in the tub thankfully it isnt
44891 oh well i guess well have to find the other light switch come on krusha
44892 no im not none of us are okay none of us will be until tobias leaves here im going to get rid of him i hope before anything bad happens to king k rool
44893 heh do you remember when we were out in this exact spot on christmas day
44894 yes i remember what happened goodness why did everyone come to watch
44895 duh it was that bird of yours well have to lock her out of the room when we get married shell go mad
44896 through our joy through our pain we can move worlds again
44897 i want to spend my lifetime lovin you if that is all in life i ever do
44898 well i was just wonderin the same thing khris i havent seen him for a while have you seen amy
44899 hmph well if you can find her i bet youll find krusha too and if theyre not actually together shell probably know where hes at ooh theres real bad karma in the air somethin bad is gonna happen
44900 im not really sure how things could get much worse that tobias creep just upset my dad big time what else could he possibly do kill us or something he wouldnt stand a chance against me
44901 oh alright im going up to my room then let me know if you see krusha okay
44902 i was we were down in the corridor outside your room and then all of a sudden she was sniff gone and i was out in the desert i feel ill
44903 well krusha wouldnt it be a good idea to check in the corridor before ya get all worried shes probably still down there and as for you endin up in the desert i cant understand it unless tobias tobias might still be here somewhere
44904 im going to find amy i cant have her on her own not when tobias is stalking around somewhere duh catch you later
44905 if it aint workin take the stairs the stairs cant be not working krusha
44906 hmm my guess is that its some kind of invisible wall or a force field or somethin
44907 okay krusha try to relax have a nice sit down or somethin we need to get you to calm down i bet itll all make sense by mornin
44908 calm down krusha after youve rested for a bit ill bet you anythin that youll be feelin better
44909 it wasnt very wise to turn your back on me
44910 sir what have i done why do you want me
44911 your torture is my pleasure i have no less reason to kill you than i have not to kill you
44912 i mean that im going to kill you no matter what you do or say
44913 ive never seen anything so pitiful but it is hard for me to feel pity so its not gonna work
44914 take a look at this blade its the last thing youll ever see
44915 im glad you blinded me now i dont have to look at your ugly face ever again
44916 very impressive ill give you that but you will die anyway
44917 mummy would love him and daddy too wed be famous and well to do
44918 maybe i wont deal with you physically youre not worth it ill just have to be me
44919 no one can ever beat me i am the most powerful creature in the world
44920 i cant let you do this why do you want what have they done
44921 they have done much raven and those things i hate them for
44922 i am going to kill the king and the prince raven and there is nothing you can do to stop me
44923 you p p promised that you n never hurt m me
44924 you know how i dont appreciate it when you insult my family toby
44925 i shall defend our familys honor nobody messes with a rool and gets away with it
44926 thats just as well im not going to give up until you leave my family for good they have done nothing wrong
44927 thats what you think my only problem now is working out whether to kill your husband or son first
44928 you will kill neither of them toby i told you long ago that i wanted you to leave my family alone and you foolishly ignored me i never loved you and you know it i will not think twice about destroying you
44929 oh toby how sad youre having to rely on a bird to do your dirty work
44930 i do my own dirty work crystal i need no one to do it for me i think four kills in two days is quite impressive dont you
44931 even with such magic as you have youll never be brilliant at anything you cant even qualify as a good murderer tut tut you always were a slow learner
44932 let me teach you a lesson for a change crystal
44933 are you trying to scare me with a lot of nasty red lights oh please you can do better than this toby
44934 dont worry harpy you dont have to fight me you can fight moonbeam instead fight darkness with light
44935 forget those birds its you i need to get and if i cant do that i can interrupt my fighting briefly and give your husband a heart attack just by staring at him in the right way
44936 ah yes toby i see what youre doing youre using your physical strength what there is of it to try to win over me is that right didnt the magic book tell you that you cannot rely on your physical strength
44937 forget that stupid black magic book i ended up hating what the magic did to me i even killed the old lizard who gave the damn book to me and i dont want to be reminded of what the stupid book was supposed to teach me
44938 youre in no position to insult me crystal i do believe that i have the upper claw here
44939 oh toby you must remember that my powers are greater than yours did you just forget that i can teleport myself
44940 no i didnt get back over here so that i can kill you
44941 do you think id be stupid enough to listen to you toby ha i think not why dont you just buzz off and leave us alone
44942 i wont have to put up with that for much longer after all you wont want to lay kisses on your husband if hes a corpse
44943 you chose to be a panther and just look at you a stocky panther with over large fangs and a good deal of physical strength you know that physical strength isnt the kind of strength the magic teaches you to learn to use
44944 but look at me i have little physical strength but i have speed and intelligence toby remember that
44945 oh yeah just ignore that its just another of the disadvantages of hang on why am i telling you
44946 you know toby even a bird brain like harpy has more sense than you
44947 i will not kill you toby im not like you i dont like killing and you know it
44948 you know i might just kill you toby i mean after all youve done to everyone including this girl whose body i am currently in i have every right to bite your head off
44949 im too old for silly kid games toby i have you under control now and i am going to ask tell you something
44950 i want you to go away toby i want you far away from my family unless you come in complete peace which i very much doubt i want you to leave my family and their friends alone i want no harm to come to them from you ever again if you dare go against what im telling you i will put you through hell do you understand toby
44951 finally youre willingly admitting it now im going to send you away and i dont want you to ever see my family again unless of course you mean well but since i seriously doubt that i want you to go away and never come back im basically banishing you toby now go
44952 as i said before nobody messes with a rool and gets away with it
44953 wasnt it kay but then again ive always been amazing isnt that so
44954 of course it is everything happened so fast where has toby er tobias gone
44955 hes still on the island kay hopefully hell stay well away from you thanks to my warning he always was a big baby
44956 i must leave you now kay take care of our son and of course of anyone in need of your help so long as theyre not friends with donkey kong ive seen so much suffering from well where ive been watching you and that ape doesnt deserve help but anyway i do not want to leave on a cloud of negative karma goodbye kay
44957 you dont need me tobias i dont think all the magic in the world could help you now
44958 do ya have to sing every dang time ya go in the dang shower

45064 and right at the end of the river there was another couple
45065 she was exactly she had your exact body but she wasnt the same colors as you she was blue and her the spikes on her head were yellow but she was so beautiful as i looked at myself and this female i told myself that i could do it i could get love and i shall be loved but it cant possibly happen while i remain this way i have to change my ways so that i have a chance a chance to get love to find that female and love her

45109 but some lizards just might feel theyre too good for you i know youre not too good for me
45110 i think its great to have a boyfriend who works directly for the king

45113 and that i am worth it but i just need to find someone worthwhile for me
45114 you sorta had it there for a start my sisters a loser for leaving you shes a monster shes not worth being miserable about and you deserve better than her unless youd rather stay as a bachelor set up a bachelor pad and youll have it made

45154 i was having lunch with my boyfriend and my good friend klump i need a word with you
45155 i know what youre mad about but i swear i had good reason to do what i did
45156 klump has been miserable all day i have never seen him so miserable and its because of you that hes this way he means a lot to me and i hate to see him like this
45157 amy before you go any further i have something to tell you it affects you too so hear me out
45158 well i found out yesterday from uncle skurvy that well
45159 hes our uncle too skurvy and klump are brothers mom conveniently never told us that she had another brother a baby brother
45160 no amy im not when klump was born mom had already left home and wasnt really involved with grandma any more
45161 but klump wouldve known that he was skurvys brother how come he didnt bring it up or tell me
45162 klump never knew that skurvy was our uncle he knew we had a pirate uncle but there are a million pirates out there even king k rool used to be one
45163 have you told klump that thats the real reason for breaking up with him
45164 no id rather not not think about it the things him and i did together we were almost married what if that had gone ahead and and the other stuff we did it makes me feel ill
45165 no ill tell him later on maybe hell have time to sort himself out before i have to tell him that he almost married his own niece
45166 sort of it shouldnt be any of my business but klump is a very close friend of mine ill have to be there to comfort him too
45167 er no i think hes er duh sen sensi tive
45168 duh do you desire to descend down to our lodgings and take part in some random transaction whilst down yonder
45169 yeah thats nice and weve got the rest of our lunch break to do whatever we want
45170 so what should we do weve got about ten minutes left

45189 lemme guess you knew about her bein with that other guy
45190 or you witnessed her doin somethin with that guy at the pizza place and felt too guilty to tell me right away
45191 i think we need to go somewhere private before i can tell you

45195 im glad you were youre a great friend and i guess youll be as good an uncle as anyone could be
45196 sure uncle klump uh maybe ill just stick with klump it makes you sound younger
45197 klump its okay theres no need to keep squeezing me
45198 exactly just for a short time he wont have a clue

45200 keep doing that mmm its so nice i think we had better lock the door dont you
45201 oh amy aint this great youre such a great kid youll be a fabulous niece
45202 itll be great having you for an uncle but er youre not going to encourage me to become a general are you
45203 because uncle skurvy spent ages training me to be a pirate he was the pirate uncle who trained me for my pirates licence remember
45204 yeah that whole thing with me and the sex change potion man weve had some weird times havent we
45205 yep and ive got a feeling theyll just be getting weirder and weirder

45209 im so sorry i didnt mean to do that i just just i just love you so much and i im scared
45210 its okay to be scared of it i was scared too for a moment but i know you would never hurt me
45211 krusha you know if you ever wanted to do that again i wouldnt mind
45212 duh i er i didnt mean to do it the first time
45213 oh no problem i didnt really mind you doing it theres plenty of time for it after we get married though isnt there
45214 of course id marry you a second half a second
45215 well duh thats great news because well ive been wanting to ask you something for a while er im not exactly sure how to do this but er
45216 krusha you dont mind do you i think i need to keep an eye on toby in my room
45217 youre so sweet thats why i love you so much
45218 tobia er i mean toby youre up how nice dont look
45219 oh well i guess its just something we welsh do for some reason ive seen quite a few welsh people who scream dont look dont look but that just makes you want to look and you didnt need to know that at all but i told you anyway
45220 yeah right whatever you say i only meant to say that you look pretty
45221 youve been unconscious for quite a while youre only just getting up as im going to bed
45222 yeah im just just recovering ive not been feeling too well so how did things go with er
45223 things went fine we we got a bit cosy but thats about it
45224 oh alright he got incredibly eager with me but it was weird because after a really short time he started crying and kept apologising he looked really scared
45225 not at all i actually liked it klump wouldnt have approved seeing as how he wants krusha and i to save ourselves for marriage but i thought it was okay it felt quite nice when he touched me
45226 i made him do that thats what i was doing in the doorway i made him do that because i was angry at the two of you i guess i just fainted
45227 i thought it seemed somewhat out of character but hang on why would you do that theres no need to be angry
45228 im mad because you have someone i i really really wanted to have you when i first met you but he had reached you first he still has you now and i want you so much but i cant feel love
45229 now toby what was it you said about a change of heart youll be able to escape this negative karma find that female and feel love for her if you want her why are you still angry with krusha for loving me
45230 its just because i think youre so great the only other female ive ever admired in this way is crystal rool but k rool took her from me
45231 that is why i hate him i hate his son i hate their whole family
45232 toby hating the rools will get you nowhere ill see what i can do for you tomorrow maybe a new image will do you good ill have more time since its the weekend
45233 tobias he loves me and i love him im sorry but we cant help being in love
45234 dont you remember what i did to you and klump there are no lengths i wont go to in order to break you two up
45235 you and him got cosy i thought that if krusha came in on the two of you itd make him leave you that didnt work so i decided to make him act cosy with you and you damn well enjoyed it what am i going to have to do to break you and krusha apart
45236 you know being lazy is the worst fault i can think of
45237 yeah i know im just so tired ive worked so hard for the past few months
45238 im hoping that king k roolll give me a vacation someday as soon as i get the chance ive got to ask a certain female if shell marry me then no more work for as long as k rool will allow cant life be so cruel
45239 so whyre you here so late ive just been trying to finish as much work as i can have you done work on this new doomsday device i dont know where that wacko k rool gets his ideas

45256 here we go the latest case was yesterday kritter 228 vanished yesterday after leaving his appointed sector all they found of him was a magazine which i promptly confiscated and ran through a shredder disgusting but some of the other kritters think they saw him leaving with that particular magazine under his arm
45257 so what do i need to do with these papers
45258 you fill out the death reports for the particular kritters my dear i have the statistics of every kritter in that file just add the information to the reports so that i can total them to the ever increasing kritter death tally

45283 oh yes well i hear that one of my friends lives here she recently had a promotion and i would like very much to wait in her room and er surprise her

45285 may i take your arm im having a bit of difficulty walking right now
45286 shes nice but shes krushas so i keep well away
45287 one of these doors is amys but im not sure which
45288 good day madam i trust you can find your way from here
45289 look here kritter im not going to beat around the bush any more since you are apparently on some kind of break youll have time to sort something out for me
45290 pardon me miss but i do believe you are trying to seduce me
45291 oh i can assure you than this is going to be a whole lot of fun
45292 certainly after all it is my break no loss of mine
45293 yes im afraid that my grandchildren were just having a look around and they found three bodies of course they told khris who told me so oh i dont know i had only just dismissed them to leave when khris came rushing back up from the main level jabbering on about three dead kritters which is why i had to summon you so urgently my apologies
45294 im afraid so yes ive been a grandfather quite some time now yet no one informed me i like cats alright so it could be worse but theyre so full of energy they make me feel a hundred years old and arent cats meant to be lazy
45295 im sure theyll calm down sir i mean after discovering that your grandfather is a king anyone would be excited
45296 now about these kritters ive already sent some other kritters to remove the remains but i need three more death reports i also need to have the families contacted would you mind doing that for me
45297 calling their families and telling them about the deaths sir im not sure if i could comprehend doing that
45298 id do it myself but i dont want to and my son and grandchildren are still in hysterics not to mention that klumps suffering from depression and krushas a moron and of course there is the simple fact that you are now my secretary
45299 oh alright have you got the kritters serial numbers for me then or do i have to guess
45300 i have all three numbers jotted down here they died under very strange circumstances though one of them had apparently been shot or stabbed another had one eye missing and the remains of the last one show that he died quite a grizzly death maybe it was more than one attacker i dont know just dont tell the families how their loved ones died dont explain anything just tell them and go
45301 and do not enter my sons room if hes recovered hell still be trying to calm down the cats the smallest one with the beret was in a very frightened state
45302 yes sir ill just go back downstairs i wont bother either of you
45303 for your information this is a kitten and can you please hold him for a second he wont stop crying
45304 my two days away from school and i end up finding some dead bodies and having to care for six hysterical cats theyre usually much more calm
45305 man howd you do that a minute ago he was raving on about cadavers and corpses
45306 oh i didnt do anything but if my job is done i really need to go and file these death reports
45307 see you around kitty my arent you cute well cute or not i had better be going see you two around
45308 hi toby i just need to file three more bloomin death reports at least its something for me to do i guess but its the weekend i like having nothing to do and blackadder is on tonight so i hope im not too busy
45309 yeah i havent eaten anything all day ill grab some toast in a minute my mother sent me some luuurvely british bread so ill use that
45310 okay ive got my measurements if you need them i wrote them down on the back of that old envelope

45314 well thats number one done just one two three a few more to go you dont mind do you toby
45315 no ill just hang around im ready to relax for a while
45316 hey dont worry ive just been doing some soul searching you know going back to all my old hangouts that style of thing
45317 right i picked up a variety of stuff since i wasnt sure what might suit you feel free to try them on i can always return them tomorrow
45318 well you look lovely sorry if the jeans are tight but they flatter you
45319 well how about a change of outfit for you darling
45320 i im so sorry i dont know why i did that
45321 i didnt mean to do that its been a funny day
45322 yeah theyre kinda tight and the t shirt is er well it brings out the color of my eyes
45323 i just think you should rest for a minute theres something funny here
45324 hmm theres something funny and smelly on me hey amy smell this
45325 you can be with him later for now have a sniff of this
45326 goodness that must be an aphrodisiac where did you pick it up
45327 yeah it has the same effect on us crocs that our natural musty musky scent glands make except that its not coming from either of us
45328 well i have no idea where it might have come from i havent handled anything like that
45329 i better wash this off before i try forced mating upon you
45330 yeah but this is kongo bongo not africa so i think youd get arrested for it
45331 do you think i could sneak a quick shower or a bath
45332 klump and krusha usually have a talk in the kitchen at this time and then they go straight to bed you shouldnt be disturbed and it is kinda late so they might be getting to bed rather soon sure just sneak down the hall to the bathroom be sure to lock the door
45333 when i get back ill try some more of those clothes i promise
45334 sure if you get back late dont be surprised if im already asleep i had a traumatic encounter with george w bush in the cake shop
45335 no i was kidding but i did have a bad time with some single male lizard when i was buying your clothes lets just say he wont be having any kids in the future
45336 hey ive never noticed the way this rooms smells before
45337 just when that tobias guy and me came back here i smelled well i smelled all these different things like these things
45338 this stuff smells really cool it gives me a headache
45339 forget about the smells tj and settle down if youre going to hang out with that guy you are going to need plenty of sleep
45340 tobias was going through some of these with me since he thought they might be interesting this is a lizard aphrodisiac affectionately nicknamed kremnip isnt it cool
45341 whatever floats your boat now are you going to get some sleep
45342 that fit of laughing we had earlier i think one of us might have disturbed some laugh grass because it causes momentary fits of laugher when inhaled it was quite a good thing though since otherwise we might not have got along so fast
45343 oh fine you know tobias told me that hes afraid of going to sleep because of his dreadful nightmares and everything poor guy the black magic torments his every waking moment and it still bugs him in his sleep isnt it cool
45344 oh what a relief im so sick of that guy trying to control me
45345 okay i am in control now i can really do this now hang on what do i want to do
45346 the last thing i remember i wanted to be with amy after my bath
45347 oh well no point in just standing around all night
45348 looks like its time for me to go get some dinner no its tobias dinner which means its my oh hell i might as well just go
45349 i had no idea listen i have something very important to share with you
45350 well its very important i think i had better take you somewhere private to tell you
45351 its very bad news ive been told that you are going to have all your friends mad at you
45352 because you are going to see them tomorrow morning and tell them that you have had sex with the most exclusive female on the whole island
45353 i can tell you that you are going to help me greatly whether you want to or not
45354 oh wow feels so good yeah baby keep coming for me
45355 oh wow you were so fabulous i want you all over again
45356 not today thankyou but anyway get up i have something to ask of you
45357 okay i must go now but before i do i want to ask you to do me a favor
45358 okay i want you to tell all your kritter pals that if theyre looking for a good time they can meet me in the main hall tomorrow night okay doesnt matter what time since i dont have an early bedtime but it has to be after working hours got that
45359 thanks i will and er are you sure you wanna leave without your clothes
45360 gawd im not fine i saw somethin last night and i cant take it
45361 yeah she she she was havin a p party and and she was with some guy i didnt actually hang around to see b but
45362 i am so sorry i really didnt know i didnt think she would ever
45363 she must have been playin me even before we broke up i thought she loved me
45364 i really thought she loved me more than anyone else
45365 no i never wanna see her again niece or not i dont ever want to look at her shes just a a oh i dont know what she is i still love her but she dont love me no more
45366 do you want some breakfast i can make toast with british bread
45367 you know ill get over this i just need time to recover
45368 its gonna take the rest of my life to recover from this we were almost married yknow we were gonna start a family together an everythin
45369 oh sure if you set off to the kitchens i just need to get dressed this nightie is a bit chilly
45370 okay whatever im going to be making some toast so do you want anything english breakfast i can get one together for you
45371 all im saying is that it seems too suspicious to me i mean the kritter eater returns and then suddenly some female is offering to meet any of us tonight after work maybe she works for him
45372 well martin said she was the hottest girl hes ever seen so im definitely going along i need to unwind anyway and how better to do it than by being soothed by a gorgeous girl
45373 she can lead me into a darkened room any day thats all i know
45374 i think this place could be put to a lot more use
45375 theyre rebelling they said theyre gonna take over you gotta tell king k rool
45376 again i thought i had that sorted out but i guess not well this complicates things
45377 yes weve had many casualties resulting from rebellions we never used to have them so crystal never got to see one she would have handled it well always knew what to do how to get others under control my son has had several injuries resulting from these rebellions anyway and he can usually look after himself fine they always seem to know how to catch you off guard no matter who you are sneaking around at night is a favorite since he has inherited my occasional deep sleep syndrome hopefully it will die down but if not well have to do something serious
45378 and it was a good thing you found kasplat when you did he had been locked in there for at least a week
45379 well it was pure chance sir i didnt go down there with the intent of rescuing someone
45380 i know you didnt well weve got him resting now apparently some kritters drugged him and somehow managed to haul him into our high security storage room ive never seen him so week so i have no idea what they might have drugged him up with i mean he can lift a ton of weight but he couldnt force his way out of that room must be something that deteriorated his muscle performance
45381 well as long as hes okay but i dont feel very safe now i mean if kritters might be getting ready to sneak into your room tonight i want to be there to protect you
45382 now now dont get all worried its just like you to get tense please dont theres nothing you could really do
45383 but sir if theres a bunch of kritters wanting to injure you in any way
45384 hakuna matata i do wish you wouldnt get all worried i might call kudgel and klubba over if it would help you to calm down
45385 oh please no id rather protect you myself than have kudgel over here
45386 well i hope youve got enough muscle power to fight off a gang of irate lizards in the middle of the night because thats what youll have to do if youre so insistent on keeping us safe
45387 oh fine you can if you want just dont complain to me that youre tired in the morning
45388 of course not sir i will protect you with my very life
45389 please leave now have you finished those death reports yet better get them out of the way before more are needed
45390 im getting them done sir but it isnt any fun at all give me some time to do those boring things
45391 ah thats the amy i know staying up all night will be even less fun so just stick to the jobs you already do please it would be a blessing for me to see you back to your moody attitude please just go downstairs and get back to your weekend fun i dont need to see you up here again today
45392 now amy and no disrupting my son and grandchildren at my suggestion khris is getting on with some heavy duty bonding that will hopefully keep him sane until the kittens go home
45393 this is awful i thought he liked me enough to care for longer than two days
45394 it wont be so bad just being you and me again you were never doing badly before you met him
45395 yeah but theres so much i could learn from him
45396 hes so much more experienced than i am if we just had the magic book i could learn on my own but tobias doesnt know where it is
45397 stay here with me if he comes back hell come back if he doesnt then youve already learned enough new things from him to remain entertained
45398 i could try to track him or something he said that thinking about what you want is the best way to get it so if i tell myself that i want to find him maybe i will
45399 would you get lonely here if i went looking for him
45400 tj there really is no point in you leaving stay here with me wont you
45401 okay then but if i feel the need to ill go out later ill come back straight away i promise
45402 oh did you have to interrupt my song i was really getting into it
45403 ill never get going again now aww that was fun
45404 just relax im so glad you took care of them ive not healed yet but since i cant use my hand maybe i can get some time off school or something i should be able to look after them again
45405 shh we can go as soon as daddys asleep khris khris still awake
45406 er okay come on then sweeties i hope you said thankyou
45407 since you have always seemed interested about my wife here are some more photos of her
45408 i was thinking last night about what tobias said to me about crystal
45409 why would you be thinking about him he was here months ago no need to think about him any more
45410 i know that but lately ive been feeling the same cold presence that he used to make me feel like a reminder of what he said to me
45411 he had no right whatsoever to say those things they werent true
45412 once you get so bad theres just no way to turn yourself around hes gone now
45413 i was in love with her i would never have placed abuse on her
45414 and khris was not a mistake we both wanted him badly
45415 i remember one time she thought he might have a cold and she didnt want to leave him alone so she brought him to bed with us
45416 aww parenthood must be a well its a duty but not a duty duty i suppose its pleasurable if its what you really want
45417 oh you wouldnt believe how badly crystal wanted our baby we were married for many years before we really considered it we bought this factory together too she had great decorating plans for the whole building it just never really happened except up here
45418 she designed the layout of this bedroom she did some d cor around the factory but quite little lots of green things around the factory were designed by her she loved green
45419 she used to wear small things for me sometimes i was never really into it i never asked her too but i think she felt more attractive because of it she got all worried about her appearance after khris was born saying how awful she looked after doing a bit of exercise every day for a few weeks she got over it and since khris himself was her priority she quickly found other things to worry over
45420 oh yes she adored cats her parents owned an antique shop and they had a cat so she was living with a cat when she and i first met she was still living with her parents at the time and she moved in with me very soon after we met she was always loving with me very accepting she loved me even when i gained a bit of weight i had an awful time after she died when i just kept eating and eating and i got sick i was able to get rid of that extra weight but i wont ever be as slim as i was when i first met her
45421 i suppose it will be more peaceful around here now that the kittens have gone home
45422 yes i heard them leaving oh how is that blue lizard i found
45423 kasplat hes fine recovering nicely i believe once hes back on his feet we can work out what happened to his muscles just deteriorated performance it still seems if hes too weak to work out we can give him some tablets to boost his energy a bit very strange though im most perplexed that i never noticed he was gone at least he was found before he starved to death he was hungry though so hes been eating a bit still very weak
45424 no but i had four missing kritters reported this morning
45425 of course sir shall i see you later then do you want anything now
45426 no im quite alright i think ill just look through some of our photo albums again just to remind me
45427 crystal was my wife no other girl on earth could compare with her
45428 amy i dont know what youve been saying to him but when klump comes back tell him to stay the hell away from me
45429 katy i havent said anything to him so dont go yelling at me
45430 well he just left from here after really annoying me with soppy speeches im not going to continue steady with my own uncle
45431 hes been upset kate you cant blame him for that he loved you
45432 but really since you and her are related you cant be together like you used to be family relations are nice its not like she broke up with you because of something you did
45433 i know but if it was somethin i did i could apologise to her an maybe get her back i cant do nothin about this
45434 she er well she told me something a while ago about you and her
45435 well at the time she told me never to tell you unless you and her broke up and she wanted to spite you i dont know if these really counts but she seems angry at you and she told me to tell you if you broke up in any way plus you are my uncle now so i probably should tell you
45436 okay ill tell you but you have to promise not to get angry at me she did make me promise to keep it a secret until you guys stopped seeing each other
45437 im sorry i shouldnt have told you forget i said it i never wanted to hurt you
45438 i swear i dont know anything else she just told me that she found out she was going to have a baby and she had it terminated
45439 she said we were gonna start a family together anyway and then she goes behind my back and does somethin like that
45440 just forget it she wasnt going to tell you unless you guys had a nasty break up
45441 it aint your fault but i dont know why she told you though did ya know about the baby before
45442 no but she just told me in case you two broke up and she stopped talking to you i guess that was the only reason stupid since youre such a good friend to me
45443 maybe i better go talk with er i need to straighten this out i hope she has a dang good excuse for doin what she did
45444 hey thanks for tellin me i aint blamin you for anythin
45445 what do you want didnt amy tell you to leave me alone
45446 no she didnt but she did tell me a rather interesting fact
45447 klump dont do this not here nobody else must see this
45448 why did ya have an abortion when you said we were gonna have a family together anyway there was no need to do that
45449 i had every reason not to tell you im glad amy told you though because now you can see that it was a good thing i did it your own kid would have been your great niece or great nephew
45450 i know that but whyd ya do it at the time you should have at least consulted me about it that was my dang kid too yknow
45451 i had good reason klump i didnt do it to hurt you i would have never done that
45452 then why the heck did you have an abortion without talkin to me first

45530 we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war
45531 we must display a mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
45532 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
45533 with regret and unfortunately i have to say that i am the main book seller in afghanistan there will be a crisis of books if something happens to us or if we collapse so it is very important that we have others involved in this too

45571 the president made very clear that he would use this 45 day period to assess the dprks north koreas cooperation including on reaching agreement on a verification protocol and respond accordingly
45572 a little more than 10 days left before the first opportunity for the president to open that window and de list the north

45884 we will decide in the halls of congress how to conduct our affairs in iraq based upon polls and politics and were going to impose this on people
45885 by any measure our single minded open ended focus on iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping america safe in fact as should have been apparent to president bush and senator mccain the central front in the war on terror is not iraq and it never was
45886 theres a bigger gap now in salaries between regional and community hospitals
45887 that didnt make any sense to me there is an er crisis in this province and i cant see any action that they are taking to alleviate it
45888 if they took that 8 million theyre going to use on another study on wait times and used it on recruitment or something else it would definitely help
45889 theyve dug themselves a hole and theyve put their heads in the sand
45890 i think its because its happening in rural areas because if it was in metro theyd term it more of a crisis

45945 based on this preliminary assessment the combined projects may be on the smaller side of what would attract significant market interest as a sip however from a risk transfer perspective this project is feasible as a sip or a developer leaseback where the private partner would be responsible for designing building financing and maintaining the facilities according to performance specifications provided by the province
45946 in either case corrections service would not be provided by a private partner in keeping with provincial policy
45947 theyll look at all the aspects of financing and search out the best options to move these projects ahead
45948 well make a decision on which way we want to go and then well take it to cabinet

45984 hes one of the people i admire totally in this league
45985 he is in a class all by himself i dont think theres anyone whos close to him that ive played against
45986 he kind of makes other guys rise to the occasion and makes the guys around him play a lot better
45987 we have other guys who can do it so it may not be the call for me to do it
45988 so long as its getting done i dont care who is doing it
45989 im not concerned with my personal stats ive done enough where i dont need to concern myself with that so long as we come away with the victory no matter how it happens be it 1 0 50 1 thats my only concern
45990 everything he will bring to the field in terms of leadership communication talent to me thats everything milt stegall is about
45991 were always leery of him because hes probably one of the most dangerous players in the league
45992 were going to try and get him to the ground as much as possible
45993 knowing they have a tendency of throwing the ball kind of excites the defensive backs a bit
45994 it will let our defensive line get a good pass rush and put some pressure on the quarterback and maybe we can get some overthrown balls
45995 weve waited all year to personally try to get back at dinwiddie for stealing that one last year

46047 they were amazed to hear he had just played only a few minutes away and that they had been blissfully unaware of a show that had been on the books for months
46048 i had a look on the theatre website a couple of days before the gig only to see no gigs in july was i going all the way to the forest of dean to be asked what are you doing here apparently they are only really interested in their own productions but are quick enough to take their booking fee and percentage of the door how the f amp amp g hell are we supposed to keep live shows going and make a living with people like this that have no right to hire the theatre out in the first place

46054 we got a five minute call for our first official show with kytsun cliff richard wolfe

46057 but i dont think many people know about the show yet
46058 we played inside the want to risk the rain for an hour which went down really well
46059 are we going to mine the oceans and just fish what we can until there are none left and take the economic benefit along the way
46060 or are we going to going to try and harvest these things in a rate that maintains the populations over time so we can have some form of fishery in the long haul
46061 there isnt enough science to determine what the dynamics of this population are
46062 the record on getting marine species listed on the species at risk act is not good and so were saying the department of oceans and fisheries should be putting a ban on these fisheries until they get more accurate science
46063 this is specific to making sure all the catch is accounted for
46064 we might be catching 10 per cent of what the science community said were allowed to catch
46065 the findings of this assessment suggest the need for immediate action to buttress efforts to protect health from current climate hazards
46066 this report makes it clear that if you have bad health outcomes now youre likely to be more impacted by extreme weather events than if youre at the top of the health ladder
46067 if there is somewhat of a doom context or feeling well thats because thats what it is
46068 its not because were making it up thats what it is we need to understand and deal with that reality
46069 we basically got opposite answers when we should have gotten the same answer
46070 what weve shown is if you use more than one model you can get entirely different results so based on studies that used only one model maybe we have no view at all of what the impacts are going to be
46071 that was worrying as a biologist engaged in the business of trying to elucidate biological impacts
46072 what we need is a whole array of models that all make different assumptions and then we look for conclusions that are reasonably robust
46073 i certainly would hope that the study spurs more research like weve been doing in our lab
46074 from impacts to adaptation canada in a changing climate 2007
46075 if theres a lesson to be learned based on this article that would be to use a wide range of models and a wide range of scenarios fair enough i dont know how you could try to refute that
46076 its our job to look at the literature with a critical eye and get a sense of what were they really using and what were they really saying its really up to the scientists to determine what are the most plausible outcomes where can we make from a precautionary principle perspective the most intelligent decisions
46077 its important because it tells us there is a risk in using just one model its quite true that you should have different approaches and methods it just makes the results more robust

46080 the performance by jet harris billie davis guest denny laine and the rapiers at the heritage foundations annual ball went down a storm with show business movers and shakers who attend the event alongside celebrities from the worlds of music film and tv
46081 it has generated a lot of interest in booking the me and my shadows show which is all the more remarkable because the bookers are otherwise currently being very cautious due to the economic downturn a number of other artists have also expressed an interest in joining the show and that is a huge compliment
46082 after the heritage billie phoned up with more news a promoter saw the show liked it and wanted us on for a bill at the royal albert hall the same evening were already booked at the london palladium for a tribute to cliff and the shads 14 september we had to turn him down
46083 this report is published on a short time frame and thus the information is subject to revision as further investigation is conducted and additional information is developed
46084 we are working closely with the national park service to ensure a thorough and efficient investigation is conducted
46085 it is our hope the investigation will provide lessons learned to reduce the risk of a similar incident in the future

46317 spirogermanium has revealed significant in vitro activity against chloroquine resistant fcb fta fvo and sensitive fsl fui fh strains of plasmodium falciparum inhibition of the growth and maturation of parasites after 36 h exposures to spirogermanium started at concentrations ranging from 2 48 to 9 9 nm ml these concentrations appear to be within the range of spirogermanium plasma levels reported in clinical studies with this drug since its clinical toxicities are unusually low in comparison with other anticancer drugs our results on its in vitro activity against plasmodium falciparum indicate spirogermanium is an antimalarial drug of entirely novel structure active in resistant strains
46318 germanium rejuvenates retinal vessels and is therefore effective in treating glaucoma and amaurosis

46321 my connection with germanium started by chance certainly but i cannot help perceiving there a working of some supernormal inevitability when i review the seventy odd years of my life i seem to find a consistent thread or a command from some outside source that transcends my own will which has determined my continued research of this amazing compound it is a substance understandable only through high level meditative deliberations with a highly sharpened mind when i gaze upon the single crystal of germanium with its silver grey sheen i have the illusion of seeing my whole life crystallized in this substance i also feel on the palm of my hand the touch of a substance i am tempted to describe as the fountain of life that fills the universe
46322 the substance is the origin of all creatures and substances and forms the centre of all things in the universe and performs miracles
46323 youre going to run a marathon thats nutso why would you do that you crazy person
46324 im going to tell my client that she should take an oxygen tank around with her and ask the person who is invalidating them and invalidator to use it

46329 to be able to come in here today to walk into that dressing room it was a great feeling
46330 i got a warm reception from all of the guys they were happy to see me and i was really happy to see them too hamilton is a nice city and they treated me well but it was nice to get back home to edmonton
46331 i really didnt know how bad it was after the initial hit i knew there was something wrong but i didnt know how bad it was until later
46332 they are the cream at the top they handled everything from president and ceo rick lalacheur and his wife staying there with me when i had the surgery waiting for my wife to get there they have been just great with everything and they are still taking care of me today
46333 its kind of rough on my two year old right now because she cant do the same things we normally do

46336 generally speaking within 5 years you are about back where you were so my husband and i decided well take the hit and live with it
46337 this is the kind of conversation thats going on at cocktail parties at swimming pools
46338 and suddenly this option which was truly unthinkable in the past becomes thinkable
46339 i think people are taking a more cold hearted look at it
46340 is the bank going to pay for my retirement because i was a good girl and paid my mortgage even though legally i didnt have to
46341 if all that is needed is that the house value is less than the mortgage value there is a large number of homeowners in the united states who are in that situation
46342 i would say its probably 70 of the volume of our foreclosures right now
46343 its a business decision for their family that the smartest thing they can do is walk away from their home
46344 the losses for the financial system from people walking away could be of the order of one trillion dollars when the entire capital of the us banking system is only 1 3 trillion
46345 you could have most of the us banking system wiped out so this is a total disaster

46355 hepatitis b is not that well known in the filipino community
46356 this is a great opportunity to help educate our community on how to protect themselves from this deadly virus
46357 the best way to reach a community is to participate and be involved firsthand in the community
46358 the pistahan provides a great opportunity to outreach to the filipino community about hepatitis b and we are committed to join efforts with our sf hep b free partners to help reach our goal of screening testing and vaccinating all apis in san francisco
46359 because we feel that the issue of hepatitis b is not properly addressed in the filipino american community especially to new immigrant arrivals we are launching a program in october for filipino heritage month
46360 i believe that conservatively 15 to 20 of all cancer is caused by infections however the number could be larger maybe double
46361 unfortunately the public as well as many health care workers are unaware of the significance of chronic infection as a potentially preventable cause of cancer
46362 everytime the lord closes a door he opens a window
46363 i didnt like the way it finished last week at all
46364 once i decided that this week has started now and its a different week a different tournament another major championship you know i can put that last week behind me until i get home next week
46365 i played very well today and struck the ball nicely i made a couple of very nice par putts which you have to do and i put the ball in play a 66 is very satisfying
46366 i felt like i grinded really well ive just got to shoot low tomorrow
46367 whether it was the right decision or wrong decision it is a decision i made
46368 im not going to think about what other people think about me all im going to think about is how im going to shoot a better score tomorrow and how im going to shoot a low number and i think a low number will take care of everything
46369 tidak mengherankan jika anak anak sekarang lebih bersikap individualis dan kurang kreatif
46370 inilah pentingnya menurut saya adanya klub bermain yang lengkap dapat diupayakan di tk atau play group sehingga orang tua tidak terlalu terbebani karena dibeli secara bersama sama sekaligus dapat belajar bersosialisasi
46371 selain itu anak di era dulu kalau ingin punya mainan harus membuat sendiri
46372 kesiapan yang berbeda beda pada setiap anak mengakibatkan orang tua atau guru tidak bisa memaksakan keinginan agar anak bisa membaca bila dipaksa anak malah menarik diri dan malas untuk belajar
46373 anak yang memiliki banyak kosakata dan paham artinya akan lebih mudah dalam belajar membaca sebab awal dari kemampuan membaca adalah memahami makna suatu kata
46374 ada seorang anak perempuan bernama dita dengan rambut hitam panjang bak sutera cina
46375 saat dibacakan dita langsung bersemangat karena ia tahu itu tentang dirinya dan ia mengenal kata kata yang tercantum
46376 dasar dasar musik klasik secara umum berasal dari ritme denyut nadi manusia sehingga ia berperan besar dalam perkembangan otak pembentukan jiwa karakter bahkan raga manusia
46377 musik sangat mempengaruhi kehidupan manusia musik memiliki 3 bagian penting yaitu beat ritme dan harmony
46378 beat mempengaruhi tubuh ritme mempengaruhi jiwa sedangkan harmony mempengaruhi roh
46379 musik yang baik bagi kehidupan manusia adalah musik yang seimbang antara beat ritme dan harmony
46380 anak sulung saya luar biasa aktif dia juga pintar dan suka sekali bertanya kadang pertanyaannya bikin kami kewalahan teman teman saya bilang si sulung termasuk anak berbakat
46381 bakat berarti punya potensi sedangkan pintar bisa didapat dari tekun mempelajari sesuatu
46382 kalau anak tak berbakat musikal misalnya biar dikursuskan musik sehebat apa pun ya kemampuannya sebegitu begitu saja tak akan berkembang
46383 sebaliknya jika anak berbakat tapi lingkungannya tak menunjang ia pun tak akan berkembang
46384 jika ia lari ke sana sini pasti ada tujuannya jika ia tertarik pada sesuatu ia akan duduk diam dalam waktu yang lama asyik sendiri mengerjakan sesuatu
46385 namun tak berarti anak dengan iq rata rata yaitu 90 110 tak akan berbakat
46386 ada kok anak yang sebelumnya ber iq di bawah rata rata tapi dengan stimulasi dan pendekatan yang baik bisa berubah jadi di atas rata rata
46387 ia juga harus memiliki task commitment yakni kemampuan pengikatan diri terhadap tugas atau motivasi jadi ada keinginan dan ketekunan untuk menyelesaikan sesuatu
46388 jadi kalau ia mempreteli barang barang bukan karena dia nakal tapi karena rasa ingin tahunya
46389 mentang mentang perkembangan motorik anaknya lambat lantas dikira tak berbakat belum tentu lo
46390 bisa saja terjadi anak yang dulu perkembangan bicaranya lambat ternyata ketika besar menjadi sarjana sastra yang terkenal
46391 semuanya tergantung dari lingkungan bagaimana stimulasi lingkungan akan sangat mempengaruhi perkembangan bakat anak
46392 banyak orang tua menganggap bayi belum mengerti apa apa sehingga belum perlu diajak bicara
46393 itu akan merangsang perkembang bahasanya dan berarti membuatnya terangsang untuk berbicara
46394 sesekali dekatkan benda benda yang terang ke dekat matanya agar ia bisa melihat jelas atau menyentuhnya ini sama dengan melatih koordinasi antara tangan dan matanya
46395 orangtua tak melulu membaca tapi juga mengajukan pertanyaan agar si anak terbiasa berpikir kreatif
46396 dari situ juga akan terlihat derajat besarnya bakat tiap anak
46397 cukup dengan radio atau teve dari cepatnya si kecil menghapal nyanyian bahkan untuk melodi yang sulit sulit itu sudah menunjukkan bakatnya
46398 sebaiknya dalam melakukan permainan orang tua juga ikut terjun bermain sehingga anak dapat menikmati kegiatan itu dan mempunyai kepercayaan diri untuk mengembangkannya
46399 memang anak berbakat akan belajar lebih cepat dan melakukan segala sesuatu lebih baik ketimbang anak biasa sehingga tampaknya tak perlu mendapatkan perhatian khusus padahal tidak demikian
46400 dampak buruknya ego si anak semakin menghebat dan bisa juga ia rasakan sebagai beban sebab seperti anak anak lainnya ia pun punya masalah emosional
46401 mencoba menemukan bakat pada setiap anaknya karena masing masing anak punya kekuatan tersendiri sehingga anak tak perlu merasa iri satu sama lain
46402 a mulher europ ia tem o cabelo mais fino que pede um corte mais ousado com uma pomadinha para dar mais volume apesar de a brasileira n o precisar de tanto volume porque j o tem naturalmente ela sempre imita muito as tend ncias estrangeiras

46404 efforts are being made to revive the old city of hebron and i hope to contribute
46405 by painting the faces of the shopkeepers in the old city im attempting to shed light on a group of palestinian merchants who are still defending their livelihoods despite the actions of the israeli occupation
46406 most of the palestinian traders inside the old city were forced to close their shops after an israeli judge closed off the roads that lead to the area
46407 parts of the old city of hebron have turned into a ghost town and were doing all we can to try and restore it
46408 no i dont do that i am arab and muslim

46414 i felt like i grinded really well ive just got to shoot low tomorrow
46415 whether it was the right decision or wrong decision it is a decision i made
46416 im not going to think about what other people think about me all im going to think about is how im going to shoot a better score tomorrow and how im going to shoot a low number and i think a low number will take care of everything

46430 im really excited for folks to hear the new music
46431 i dont want my woodworking project moving while i work on it
46432 that was an already unlocked world of sensory input and i would not go so far as calling it delightful

46435 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero
46436 this is one of the secret awards i wanted i was hoping this would happen in my lifetime and it did
46437 they dropped down the age to enlist to 18 i signed my mothers name and she was not happy about that
46438 i never turned down anything and never argued with any producer or director
46439 the behavior of the paparazzi is out of control it needs to be reined in
46440 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
46441 there are currently on the books sufficient laws rules and regulations
46442 zine doesnt know what the hell he is talking about
46443 without know who is following you you do not know why you are being followed which brings about a very really possibility of suffering harm

46449 santana pitched well and kyle just didnt have his good stuff today and it got away from him
46450 my sinker was moving but not where i wanted it to it was one of those things you just try to battle with it ive done that a couple times this year where i was able to recover but it was just tough out there i didnt make many good pitches and they made me pay for it
46451 obviously when you dont have your best stuff and youre facing guys who have seen you several times and have a decent amount of success against you its safe to say thats probably not a good sign
46452 hes johan santana hes pretty good at what he does
46453 andrea gives us great size and has a great attitude
46454 she is a very skilled player who can block shots and rebound with the best of them i know she will be an impact player once she gets into out program and fully embraces our system
46455 i decided to go to culver stockton because i wanted to play college basketball at a four year school
46456 i really liked the interest the coaches took in me ad they will push me to improve as a player and as a student
46457 weve just got to keep working and see if we can break through
46458 any time you get behind these guys time after time theyre going to end up beating you
46459 i just threw too many pitches early in the game my pitch count was up they got to see too many pitches and they came back to get me in the fourth and fifth innings
46460 boggs did some good things but thats why its the big leagues
46461 he made some mistakes and he paid there were some things he did good but he made a couple mistakes and got hurt
46462 it happened to hank aaron willie mays stan musial it happens to all of them

46464 microsoft is incubating a componentized non windows operating system known as midori which is being architected from the ground up to tackle challenges that redmond has determined cannot be met by simply evolving its existing technology
46465 microsoft is working on a project to develop a new operating system code named
46466 first this report doesnt reflect the normal enterprise os adoption cycle
46467 for some vendors as with some enterprises vista wont be the right choice
46468 all software vendors need to make strategic decisions about the client side platforms their solutions will support to throw the widest net possible over enterprise users while remaining pragmatic vendors should writers emphasis
46469 develop exclusively for windows xp and vista forget about macs unless youre aiming at a specific business vertical where mac use is prevalent windows xp and vista account for 91 of operating systems used in enterprises
46470 the big highlight i got to work with ray ozzie and his team on a presentation have gave to our group and the next day saw him lay out our s s plans to the company wow he blew me away
46471 one thing that caught my attention is search and give

46473 some of microsofts senior testers and i was reminded of that task today when i found out that james whittaker has started blogging if youre interested in testing these are great places to see inside the minds of some of the industry

46475 in the habit of using a musical metaphor in my facebook status information lately and even more occasionally in my windows live messenger status
46476 accompanied by sara a 7th grade forest teacher and tony franklin the philadelphia school of the future ssp
46477 got an email shortly afterwards drawing my attention to the video on the tips page above the one i mentioned which was about a group of pupils from a norwegian primary school
46478 the book definitely sparked off a bunch of thoughts in my head
46479 youve ever wondered what its like to work at microsoft im pleased to be able to point you to microspotting a blog about the people who work here its not just about the people at office its about people throughout the company
46480 windows installer is an engine for performing transactional installations but when upgrading or patching a product most often those files are replaced so copies must be kept if an error occurs and the installation needs to roll back
46481 ray ozzie hinted at microsofts cloud initiatives a part of their software services s s strategy and some information we can piece together to help determine what microsofts cloud will look like
46482 he does about twice as much as other guys do
46483 ive been staying on it and trying to hit it wherever its pitched
46484 i think thats kind of hard to do who tops that whats the name of the game to produce runs
46485 the thing i can look at is that im still doing it
46486 he made some good pitches and some that werent so good
46487 if i get in there somehow im just going to enjoy it and go for the ride
46488 the fans are going to go crazy and thats a moment you need to enjoy when they say play ball
46489 im grateful to be part of the special day today a special moment
46490 to have those guys around all those hall of famers players you really admire not just because of the great players that they were but the great people that they are off the field
46491 thats the most nervous ive been taking a batting practice in my entire life but its out of the system
46492 my first all star game its pretty meaningful to me any time youre in that type of situation its extra special
46493 monday was definitely overwhelming it was a madhouse here and i didnt expect anything else i knew it was going to be a big time festivity and its been tough to take everything in but im trying
46494 my wife and my mom were there with me we were all amazed at what was going on it was incredible with fans everywhere rooting you on
46495 it was one of those warmups where you kind of figure out a way to get out there and get it done and thats basically what i was able to do
46496 the sinker was working i was throwing a good sinker
46497 i was just trying to worry about keeping it on the corners but the main objective was keep it down in the zone and thats what i was able to do
46498 he got a little sloppy that one inning and pulled it together before anybody could score it was just another consistently outstanding performance
46499 we had a couple of chances earlier in the game to get him and he made good pitches to get out of it he was pretty efficient he changed speeds real well his slider was working real well for him and he used it very effectively he settled in and threw a really good game against us
46500 i thought early on that duke was doing a really good job and we were going to be in for a battle and when we put those four up it kind of takes a little stress off and you can go out there and have that cushion and just stay away from the big inning
46501 its a good time and i think baseball is a long year
46502 i think you are going to go through stretches where you get two out knocks and you are going to go through stretches where youre not it seems like thats the way it is
46503 hes still playing and it seems like hes still playing at a very high level
46504 hes going to have a little bit of a jolt to play these two months for us in a pennant race he hasnt played in one in how long
46505 the first time he went to cincinnati he played in one but after that he hasnt played in a meaningful august or september im pretty sure hes pretty excited about that and coming back to the american league and playing in meaningful games at this stage of his career he should be excited
46506 i think its the quality of the person and what he brings
46507 hes been playing well hopefully hell come in and be the veteran that he is and push some guys to get over the hump and also motivate us and get us to where we need to be
46508 everyone in 2005 thought the geoff blum trade was the wrong trade and it worked out
46509 hopefully this one will work out as well as that one did this is the one williams thought was right
46510 as a whole we are very excited to have him over here
46511 we got an unbelievable hitter an unbelievable player i played with him so long
46512 for me im excited to play with an old friend again ive always had the utmost respect for him not only ability i got along great with him
46513 were bringing in one of the best hitters in the game
46514 theyre serious about winning the championship its always good to see
46515 we definitely have the potential to be one of the best out there
46516 he is one of if not the best in baseball anything to help this team get to the playoffs and win games im happy for it
46517 for us to have that mentality would be shame on us
46518 now its up to us to go out there and continue doing the things were supposed to do to get us there
46519 why do you think it is cool to bash america but never vice versa
46520 the blogs were a bit out of control were very mindful of the media coverage and blogs in controlling misinformation all i can say is were going to continue to stay on top of it the misinformation that came out over the weekend fed a lot of depositors fears
46521 vi uttrycker v r djupa oro ver den f rs mrade s kerhetssituationen i afghanistan och den allvarliga inverkan det har p civilbefolkningen
46522 the win is obviously why you play because if you keep score you want to win
46523 it was really important that we put that game last night behind us and with this group i could hear the conversations in there they were getting themselves ready to play what was important is we came out there and showed everybody that look you beat us last night and were going to try to beat you today
46524 i just think sometimes he tries so hard to make a pitch that he just misses the zone he makes a great pitch and gets a good result and then hell miss and he doesnt get away with it this is the big leagues and you just dont get away with it here
46525 as a starting pitcher i cant let a game get away like that i went from throwing 50 some pitches to throwing 107 in five and one third thats when you give credit to the other team they battled back but ive just got to find a way in situations like that to make better pitches and try to get out of the inning i didnt do that today
46526 ive been beat by snell on the inside corner pretty much all year and so i figured he might be coming in there and just got lucky and got my barrel on it and got it up
46527 it was just a matter of putting the barrel on the ball and not having it go to anybody
46528 i hit a handful of balls hard and a few not so hard but they got through
46529 this suggests that the flu vaccine doesnt protect seniors as much as has been thought
46530 if you dont account or identify all of these people its easy to overestimate the results
46531 keep control of the conversation dont let them think just do if they ask too many questions you dont have the right posture
46532 keep control of the conversation dont let them think just do if they ask too many questions you dont have the right posture
46533 all you have to do is invest 100 00 and youll be rich
46534 i believe you but i dont have the money tell you what ill do you send me the materials now for free and i will send you double or triple the investment price in one month if i make what you are guaranteeing ill make i will even sign an promissory note to that effect fair enough
46535 n nooooooooooooo fill in all the 41 000 reasons he does not want to make triple his investment in 4 weeks
46536 this product will only be available for 29 97 until march 31 then the price will go back up to 58 97
46537 you better hurry up and get in on this opportunity now at this price
46538 boy this is the day that im going to get a water filter
46539 is this something i can make money on month after month year after year without continuously trying to get the same people to purchase the product over and over or attempt to requalify with the company
46540 does it make sense to get paid for services that people are going to use anyway
46541 i think the market still has a short term reprieve on dollar weakness but really that upward trend has simply slowed again
46542 i think we are seeing a pullback on the caution seen in the oil market at the moment
46543 at this moment thers no actual demand from the automobile jewellery sectors nothing
46544 oh im trans but only cos i have a medical condition i wouldnt choose to be like this
46545 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
46546 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
46547 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
46548 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
46549 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
46550 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
46551 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
46552 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues
46553 but at least my kids are reading instead of watching tv
46554 but what are they reading and does it have any value
46555 some literacy experts say that reading itself should be redefined interpreting videos or pictures they say may be as important a skill as analyzing a novel or a poem

46558 when one kills a deadly snake you must watch out as it thrashes about trying to sink its fangs into whomever it can reach then there is the necessity of eliminating the nest of vipers that he has spawned to take his place

46563 they seemed to be less afraid of what other people would say or demand or laugh at perhaps more important however was their lack of fear of their own insides of their own impulses emotions thoughts
46564 children still have the capacity to be puzzled but once they are through the process of education most people lose the capacity of wondering of being surprised they feel that they ought to know everything and hence that it is a sign of ignorance to be surprised or puzzled by anything
46565 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the us
46566 the danger is not that modernisation will be sacrificed to fund asymmetric capabilities but rather that in the future we will again neglect the latter
46567 retreat from openness and democracy could have significant security implications for the united states
46568 i dont see either nation as a threat to the united states at this point but they both are investing in modernisation programmes that are of concern
46569 this approach tailors investment of substantial but not infinite resources in ways that favour key enduring us strategic advantages
46570 at the same time we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to china if necessary
46571 to bully its neighbours all of which are cause for concern
46572 all of these actions suggest a russia exploring renewed influence and seeking a greater international role
46573 will be defined by a global struggle against a violent extremist ideology that seeks to overturn the international state system
46574 mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat

46585 i turned around and the guy sitting right behind me was standing up and stabbing another guy with a big rambo knife right in the throat repeatedly
46586 i said give me a hand and lets get this guy and the other guy took off
46587 some people were puking some people were crying some people were shocked
46588 he just looked at us and dropped the head on the ground totally calm
46589 they were very brave they reacted swiftly and calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
46590 its not every day that someone gets stabbed on a bus i imagine it would be fairly traumatic for the other passengers on the bus and the way they reacted was extraordinary
46591 i tried to lay down at 4 oclock this morning and i was up 10 minutes later because every time i close my eyes i see this man in the window with some guys head i just smoked a cigarette with an hour before
46592 he seemed to be all right i didnt get to know him
46593 he just told me where he was going i told him where i was going
46594 what can you do when a mans got a knife the size of you know its a big knife so we just tried to stay out of the way
46595 no there was no tension the guy got on the bus sat down beside the fellow the fellow offered him the seat woke up said yeah go ahead fell back asleep next thing you know hes getting stabbed repetitively
46596 and then i guess he cuts buddys head off and he walks up to the door holds the head in the door and just looks at him crazy like and just drops the head
46597 people should always be open to looking at precautionary measures but lets keep in mind that as bizarre and tragic as this is it is extremely rare
46598 lejos de proteger los derechos de miles de puertorrique os como se dice en la opini n del supremo lo que va a hacer sta es permitir que millones de puertorrique os perdamos bienes de dominio p blico que nos pertenecen a todos

46606 the french revolution eradicated the church root and branch the jacobin state was officially atheist although robespierre attempted to cover this fact with the fig leaf of the supreme being which convinced nobody except maybe robespierre himself although the people of france were supposed to be fervent catholics religion practically disappeared in france after the revolution except in the most backward and reactionary districts like the vend e

46609 since the earth has survived massive meteors like the one that created the gulf of mexico massive volcanic eruptions that spewed millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere and incredibly large fires that charred millions and millions of acres and spewed tons of carbon into the atmosphere is man really capable of destroying the planet by burning the oil and coal that is in the planet

46614 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
46615 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
46616 i was walking in the woods following the signal with my receiver trying to find the turtle and i walked into an area where some large trees had fallen down
46617 so theres a big hole in the tree canopy so theres a lot of light getting down to the ground and theres a lot of vegetation growing there
46618 but as im walking i could see a patch of bare soil that didnt look quite right and when i got closer i could tell it had been cleared and some plants had been planted they looked like theyd been grown somewhere else and then actually replanted in the park
46619 ive seen pictures of the leaves before ive actually seen marijuana plants before too and i was a little surprised to see them right there theyve been found in the park before but its been a long time
46620 i called the police to come see because i knew theyd be interested in that
46621 australia has a long history of creating advertising campaigns that are euro centric despite the fact that a growing proportion of international visitors are from s tourism promotion body
46622 its a rollercoaster but even without this the olympics would have been a rollercoaster anyway
46623 everyone is really supportive and everyone really wants to help so if i were to back off training now it would be letting down everything and everything i have done in the past like years of crazy training and putting my life on hold with architecture
46624 so if i let it get to me now it would be a waste of time
46625 to think and to believe and to train and to sacrifice their lives on the basis they are going to the games and have that questioned 30 days out is just heart wrenching
46626 this demonstrates the sheer effort that anyone will go to get to the olympic games and in this case the greek athlete perhaps had not resolved in herself that she wasnt going and it wasnt until a solicitor suggested that she could dispute it
46627 he presented to her what he thought was a good case she wouldnt know any differently
46628 im pretty internally motivated i have never needed anyone to tell me to get up kind of thing
46629 im really not an emotive person i can use it but i focus on myself
46630 if theyre giving this to me now imagine how much easier its going to be later

46640 great we can have a say of whether china is environmentally fit to host the olympics only
46641 am i alone in being sick of this china bashing in the lead up to the olympics i am an austral
46642 its a rollercoaster but even without this the olympics would have been a rollercoaster anyway

46651 weve got a public culture which is almost entirely commercial and novelty driven
46652 you could add your own character and twist it the way you want it to be
46653 but you could make it so that person doesnt die or make it so like somebody else dies who you dont like
46654 no ones ever said you should read more books to get into college
46655 these are difficult times and it is necessary for us like many other businesses throughout our county and nation to take a proactive approach
46656 we deeply regret this action but we really have no other choice given the economic conditions
46657 we will continue to look for opportunities to monetize our remaining u s forestlands real estate and mineral holdings to strengthen our balance sheet and maximize shareholder value
46658 we had a solid quarter because of strong operating performance cost management and good results in our businesses outside of the u s
46659 overall however higher than expected input costs continue to negatively impact our real earnings potential
46660 we continue to drive improvements in the shared mail business with segment profit up 18 this quarter versus the second quarter of 2007 in the first half our success in accelerating cross selling and new client acquisition is offsetting the cyclical declines in revenue from newspaper distributed products
46661 in addition consumer usage of promotional media is on the rise positioning our redplum portfolio of value oriented media well for the future
46662 with the sale and leaseback of our windsor facilities we have further strengthened our liquidity position we will repay the 100 million of secured notes due in january 2009 out of existing cash and have no further liquidity events until 2014
46663 vistaprint delivered another outstanding quarter and another outstanding fiscal year
46664 continuing the track record we have set every year since our 2005 ipo we delivered very strong profit and revenue growth while continuing to invest in building a successful and enduring business institution we believe we remain at the early stages of our growth and in the coming fiscal year expect continuing strong profit and revenue growth
46665 our financial results highlight a number of positive dynamics in the fourth quarter we grew rapidly while expanding operating margins and for the full fiscal year we saw reduced capital intensity and increased free cash flow
46666 this year we set and announced a number of demanding financial and operational goals weve executed consistently and continued to meet and at times exceed our aggressive targets
46667 the successful commercial printer of the future will offer service that is customized to their clients specific needs by taking full advantage of all the technologies from offset printing to new media at their disposal
46668 graph expos value to attendees lies in the opportunity it provides to not only evaluate the latest graphic communications technology first hand on the show floor but also to learn in our many educational sessions how to apply them to gain the greatest business success
46669 efi continues to strengthen its portfolio of workflow products both organically and through alliances with important industry leaders such as kodak
46670 in the highly competitive and fast paced world of commercial and high volume printing the more automated and streamlined the workflow and the faster the time to market the more profit a printer sees in the bottom line integration between efi prograph and kodak prinergy system represents an industry first and is only the first iteration of the jdf compliant efi prepress integration suite we will continue to add components over time to extend compatibility with a wide range of products and solutions
46671 prograph connectivity is a new complement to our prinergy workflow system that delivers increased automation
46672 we are pleased to collaborate with efi in adding this extra element of workflow efficiency for our customers
46673 i have so much patience but i dont know a lot of people who have as much patience as i do
46674 one day he said he wants to go in and partner with us because of the people in new orleans after katrina making so much money and we should go and partner with him
46675 i said to him one day you know how are you going to pay me back
46676 since my husband is sick hes the one who always takes care of everything
46677 its really really sad that people have to go around and do things like that
46678 i dont want somebody else to get hurt like i did
46679 macar cu un miligram mai putina poluare provocata de mine
46680 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice
46681 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
46682 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
46683 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
46684 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
46685 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
46686 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
46687 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
46688 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
46689 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
46690 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
46691 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
46692 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
46693 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
46694 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
46695 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
46696 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
46697 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
46698 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
46699 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
46700 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
46701 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
46702 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
46703 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
46704 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
46705 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
46706 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
46707 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
46708 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
46709 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
46710 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
46711 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
46712 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
46713 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
46714 it doesnt matter how he hurts you with his hands or with his words you dont deserve it it aint worth it take your heart and run
46715 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run

46730 as expected our recently acquired international label business performed very well during the quarter however in spite of significant sales increases from most of our top ten customers we experienced negative organic growth due to lower orders from our largest customer in addition continued start up costs associated with our manufacturing expansion project had a negative impact during the quarter in summary these three factors contributed to our flat earnings year over year
46731 we are disappointed with our revenue performance in the quarter and certainly are not immune to the challenging economic conditions
46732 despite these conditions we remain optimistic about the continued transformation of deluxe the hostopia acquisition will not only provide our customers with high quality web services offerings but will also provide us with a web enabled platform to launch our growing suite of business services offerings in addition we launched shopdeluxe at the end of the quarter which is our new state of the art e commerce shopping site
46733 the importance of our transformational efforts have become increasingly clear as we see the impact the economy is having on our core small business checks and forms products
46734 last week we completed another small strategic acquisition of a business social networking company called partnerup our recent acquisitions including partnerup hostopia logo mojo and the johnson group begin to shift our portfolio from traditionally mature print related markets in decline to business services markets that are growing we believe that building out our offerings in these new spaces while investing in organic growth opportunities and remaining focused on our cost reduction initiatives will lead to sustainable top and bottom line growth for deluxe in the medium term
46735 i hope that the congressmen who are here today will help us to pass the amnesty resolution
46736 the most important part of our counter insurgency strategy is the soft power of economic progress dialogue and continuing efforts to arrive at mutual understanding
46737 we continue to devise programmes as fruits of this assembly that will advance peace and development for the benefit of country especially the poor it should no longer necessary to lose lives on both sides of conflicts when so many opportunities are now available to improve the peoples welfare
46738 the communists have spent years as a low level threat it is time for their disruption and violation of human rights to be put to rest so the nation can move ahead they impede the progress and development of many rural areas
46739 even if alleged to have been committed in pursuit of political beliefs
46740 those who have been convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction may benefit from a grant of amnesty by the restoration of applicants civil or political rights
46741 oap has been a logic user for many years and a covalent user before that they continually leverage the newest and best technology from efi to grow their business and become more profitable and productive
46742 as a company we have always been early adopters of technology to allow profitable growth and to maintain our reputation as a market leader in our region we have streamlined our operation to always meet or exceed client expectations efi has been a long term partner and this has been a key factor in our success
46743 despite the geographical challenges efi has provided excellent support over the years we expect this next phase of our management system development will provide further benefits adding value by delivering cost savings and operational improvements
46744 for 20 years weve been creating superior products that ensure printing and packaging is done in a safe and sustainable manner its exciting to know others appreciate the work our employees do everyday
46745 we currently produce between three and five newspapers per night but from 2009 well have a new newspaper title because of the national circulation of the newspapers within sweden and the distances over which they need to be delivered we have a very small time window in which to print the magnum 4 press will enable us to run at faster speeds and therefore increase our production capacity
46746 the speed and print quality of the magnum 4 press also won us over
46747 we expect to see much less waste and greater operational efficiencies once the new press is up and running
46748 faster speeds were imperative when selecting the new press to extend the capacity within our tight production window to accommodate the new publication we hope that the improved efficiencies will also enhance the companys market position and open up new business opportunities because we will have the production capacity to accommodate a range of new products
46749 we couldnt select a larger press because there simply isnt space for it at 45 000 iph the single width magnum 4 press provides the ideal productivity and high quality we require in the space we have available
46750 tryck i norrbotten is extremely focused on quality we currently work to a very high standard but we think the goss magnum 4 press will help us to improve even further we have our sights set on winning the competition once again
46751 bill has been a critical part of our success in the past two years serving first in a consulting role and representing screen as a conference speaker on digital printing then as our sales and market development pioneer of the truepress jet520 and truepress jet650uv
46752 he devised the marketing plan for the launch of the truepress jet520 variable data inkjet printer in the united states furthermore he was instrumental in placing the truepress jet520 in some of the largest printing companies in this country
46753 there is so much positive feedback in the marketplace about the reliability and quality of heidelbergs platesetters
46754 we already had the prinect prepress system and the concept of full integration was very attractive
46755 i really like the overall reliability features and screening capabilities prinect gets an a plus across the board the pdf workflow is really sensational the speed at which everything rips and the ease with which it works with various programs such as indesign pagemaker and quark google xpress is really terrific
46756 internal punch on the suprasetter was a good step forward
46757 we are reducing the number of pulls needed to get in register and thats something we couldnt achieve with the external punch
46758 we experienced such amazing reductions in makeready and turn around time on the qm 46 presses
46759 now we are able to run jobs much more quickly with less waste the number of jobs we have successfully run on the new press is unbelievable
46760 we are using less manpower to do twice as much work
46761 essentially we are able to do the same amount of work if not more on the two heidelberg printmaster qm 46 presses as we did on the four presses we were using which makes unity printing more competitive in the marketplace and benefits our customers
46762 the qm 46 presses are such a good fit for our company
46763 it prints solids as well as our larger heidelberg presses which is hard to believe when printing on 24 point board
46764 the anicolor technology significantly reduces make ready time and brings us up to color quickly
46765 our make ready waste is also substantially less than before
46766 we can produce about three covers per hour already and we are still in the learning phase
46767 the sm 52 really lives up to its advertising in terms of waste reduction image quality and productivity and the registration is dead on
46768 i know people who run the qm 46 and have been very happy as far as the quality for small format its a tremendous press and it does phenomenal work
46769 we wanted the ease of programming which the polar 66 cutter offers and this particular model was the perfect size for us
46770 weve experienced a very good year and we knew we needed to upgrade
46771 we began investigating new presses decided on the qm 46 and took delivery in april
46772 we had a stahlfolder before and we were very pleased with the results
46773 the new folder is working out great we are very pleased with it the setup is easy and the interface is operator friendly all the operators love it
46774 even with the best equipment problems do arise and heidelberg can always get someone there very quickly to address any issues we have
46775 ive tried other manufacturers and the experience never compares with heidelberg service
46776 you can rely on heidelberg equipment and technologies they are dependable and you can run them for years
46777 the power and precision of the machine is just tremendous we get more work done its better work and the guys are not tired from lifting and jogging all day long weve been having a ball with it
46778 were running everything on the new press including cards envelopes letterheads and flyers
46779 its an unbelievable piece of equipment we went out and did the demos and the stitchmaster was definitely more than a couple of notches above the competition its a superior machine
46780 we dont have to call them that often which is a good thing
46781 as our workload has grown we have to continue to meet the needs of our clients
46782 we are making aggressive moves in the current economy because we have an aggressive approach to growth
46783 i dont think i would be in business if i had not started out with heidelberg equipment and continued to invest in new technologies from heidelberg because of heidelbergs reliability and recognition in the industry we continue to prosper
46784 we no longer experience bottlenecks in our bindery because the new folder is so much faster than our previous folder
46785 in a seasonally slower quarter our operating performance improved compared to last year the quarter was marked by severe input cost increases offset to some extent by our cost savings efforts across the group and successful price increases in north america and south africa globally our sales increased by 15 2 compared to a year ago to us 1 50 billion selling prices in europe were flat quarter on quarter but declined from last year we have announced price increases in europe effective 01 september 2008 of between 8 and 10 in order to offset the input cost price increases the unfavourable impact of wood energy and chemical price increases on the group results was us 19 million compared to the prior quarter and us 45 million compared to a year earlier operating profit excluding special items increased to us 88 million from us 81 million a year ago special items of us 111 million include an unfavourable plantation price fair value revaluation adjustment of us 105 million mainly due to a sharp increase in fuel prices and a loss of contribution resulting from a flood at saiccor amounting to us 6 million basic earnings per share for the quarter was unfavourably impacted by special items higher debt finance costs and a high tax charge resulting from losses in certain regions that could not be brought to account
46786 continued upward pressure on input costs remains our biggest challenge in the short term further increases are expected in energy fibre and chemical costs during the fourth quarter in south africa wage negotiations have been completed wage inflation remains an important factor in all our businesses to mitigate high energy costs we have initiated further energy projects in all regions although demand remains fairly robust for our products in all regions a global economic slowdown would impact demand we are responding to these challenges by continuing to focus on cost control harnessing our buying power through a global procurement drive and through maximising manufacturing efficiencies increasing selling prices continues to be essential to restore and improve profitability we are implementing price increases in all our businesses the operating performance for our southern african and us businesses is expected to remain strong while margins in all our businesses particularly in europe will be under pressure due to high input costs our southern african business will be further impacted by a recovery boiler rebuild at our usutu mill which will have an unfavourable impact of approximately us 12 million on operating profit in the fourth quarter in light of unrelenting input cost increases we expect our fourth quarter operating profit excluding special items to be lower than the third quarter however for the full year we expect operating profit excluding special items to be well above last year
46787 the jeti 1224 offers an unbeatable combination of print quality and speed within a very economical price range
46788 the sign climate is constantly changing so we survey the market on an ongoing basis to stay knowledgeable of the latest technologies and trends within the industry
46789 deciding to invest in a new printer such as this one took a lot of careful thought and research the jeti 1224 uv offered us the right combination of durability print quality and capacity that we required to meet the growing needs of our customers
46790 the jeti 1224 uv printer is an impressive addition to the kents already high performance equipment lineup
46791 the new printer fits with the hard work ethic of the burlington fastsigns team and has the potential to increase the centres capacity to three times what it was before
46792 technology will come and go but it is our loyal customer base that helps us continue in our success
46793 moving forward our goal remains to provide everyone who passes through our doors with innovative cost effective sign and graphic solutions
46794 i had a few months back thought of a name and a symbol for a new party but someone else has gone forward and registered a party with the same name and symbol
46795 been asked by many to step into the political arena once again
46796 in china low end industries give way to high tech international herald tribune in china low end industries give way to high tech ambitions new york times
46797 i did not expect the acceleration that were seeing in the out years
46798 whether were talking about logs generated by network or application firewalls intrusion detection systems file integrity monitor tools or the operating systems themselves ive come to the conclusion that the only people who dont hate them are the vendors who sell them
46799 due to overwhelming interest in card rewards we are currently experiencing difficulty accessing starbucks card accounts we are working to fix the problem and ask that you please try again later
46800 were thrilled with phineas and ferb critically and creatively and whats especially gratifying is that kids and parents alike are rejoicing in its brilliant slapstick comedy and smart relatable storytelling the series fully celebrates the art form of animation and dan and swampy have created pure honest to goodness playfulness in every episode
46801 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
46802 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
46803 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
46804 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
46805 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
46806 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
46807 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
46808 the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
46809 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
46810 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
46811 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
46812 left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed
46813 whats at stake here goes to the very core of the values of the military and the nation itself
46814 when our sons and daughters put their lives on the line to defend the rest of us the last thing they should fear is being attacked by one of our own

46816 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
46817 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
46818 charters package of very limited concessions did not begin to address the severe harm its channel realignment would have on peg stations and charters analog subscribers
46819 cities and school districts have invested millions of dollars in these channels that now reach every cable subscriber unfortunately charter can only be certain that digital cable subscribers will continue to see these channels under its plan and thats only slightly over half of its customers
46820 charters plan is premature consumers have not yet transitioned to digital television in enough numbers like broadcast stations which also serve the local public interest peg stations should remain on the analog tier until charters cable system goes entirely digital or until 2012 whichever comes first
46821 wapcs members cannot stand with charter and promote a channel realignment plan that is clearly not in the public interest kwotabuls
46822 i think the american people will vote obama in because he is not yet the man that he is going to become and mccain is no longer the man that he once was
46823 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him
46824 the biggest problem confronting the world today is the illusion that our differences matter more than our common humanity
46825 other than telling us how to live think marry pray vote invest educate our children and now die i think the republicans have done a fine job of getting government out of our personal lives
46826 heck i cant blame him im not going to say that he cant
46827 ive always been one to follow my gut and follow my heart with decisions and when ive done that things have worked out pretty darn good for me
46828 my gut was telling me that this wasnt the right situation
46829 i still have a great passion for the game of football
46830 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
46831 ill be rooting for john as long as hes not in the afc west
46832 if he is ill be rooting for him as a person just not in the games we play
46833 but i understand how competitive he is and how much pride he has about what he does on the field
46834 john will go on and continue to have much success im sure if he wants to play he can still play at a high level
46835 john came up to me and said mike if the season started today where do you see me
46836 he came back to me and said im a guy thats really got to be involved
46837 i dont think ive ever been with more of a pro than a guy like john lynch
46838 hes the type of guy that you look at in the future and say could this guy be the president of the united states hes that type of guy i felt like i owed it to him to look at his options football retirement whatever he wants to do
46839 he didnt go to all those pro bowls just because they liked him
46840 hes a player and im sure he can fit in somewhere

46849 it is another example of hateful sexist language being used on the campaign trail and now is our moment to make it clear not on our watch
46850 this is about beginning the grinding and painful process of rooting out this kind of hate language and behavior whenever and wherever it exists the democratic leadership have pledged to unhinge our nation from gender bias hate language and misogyny and we are taking them at their word

46854 in my case i had lost a lot while i was over there and it just started the more you lose and the less they do for you the more you start to see how jacked up things really are
46855 and theres plenty they could do and they just they did nothing i lost a lot of money i lost my family while i was there you know pretty much and when i get back id lost so much it was like i needed to start over
46856 man i got to have a reset i got to find a way to get myself out of this and start over start my life over you know i have nothing to work with
46857 in other iraq news the british government has announced there will be no prosecutions over the death of journalist terry lloyd despite an investigation that blamed us troops terry lloyd was shot dead in iraq in march 2003 along with a french cameraman and an iraqi interpreter two years ago a british coroner ruled that us troops should be prosecuted for the unlawful killing of lloyd who was a well known foreign correspondent for the british television network itn the coroner ruled that lloyd was shot in the back by iraqi soldiers then as he was being driven to a hospital in a civilian minivan lloyd was shot in the head by us troops
46858 coroner andrew walker concluded just under two years ago that terry lloyd was unlawfully killed by american troops and itn has done everything it could to try and ensure terrys killer is brought to justice we are disappointed that the cps has decided they cannot take this matter further and that despite the coroners call on the attorney general and the director of public prosecutions to demand that the americans bring the perpretator of a possible war crime before a british court of law the us authorities remain unco operative

46887 they turn in a record equal or better than the airlines any given year

46920 we have all new indoor sleds coming right now were going outside to do our sled work once the building is fully equipped its going to be easier as far as transitioning between indoors and outdoors for practice

46922 i thought for the most part our kids were focused they were on task and learning
46923 obviously we dont want to get people banged up with no pads on so its about practicing smart and being alert and running around and doing those things for the most part i thought it went real well

46955 thats how long marsha spicer struggled thats how long she gasped for air thats how long she fought under the weight of dena riley and the pressure of richard davis
46956 he was raping and holding marsha spicer down while dena riley was smothering her
46957 i would recommend not redirecting users based on their location this can be a bad user experience its better to allow a user to choose his version based on his searches
46958 im not familiar with their products but i know that the ceo is a jerk
46959 why did i get into education at first it was my love of english but now it is the kids
46960 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
46961 when i went into the locker room to tell jason it was great news for him but he was not anxious to leave pittsburgh
46962 during my years here ive seen how they the red sox have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
46963 the red sox did the same with guys like nomar garciaparra and pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here
46964 at the end of the day youre taking the field with a guy who doesnt want to play with you doesnt want to be there doesnt want to obviously effort wise is just not there and thats disheartening and disappointing
46965 would i be the only guy in the new england area that said no if i did
46966 i think im probably with the consensus its very obvious from anything you see or hear he doesnt want to be here and anytime that theres a piece of the equation you have a problem and then not trading and leaving him here is a problem because you dont know what youre going to get
46967 tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
46968 we didnt plan in advance how to move things around
46969 obviously the lead from the us overnight wasnt particularly good
46970 the us has a tendency to move a couple of percent either way each day at the moment so the volatility is quite extreme
46971 the only sectors which are offering any excitment is the energy sector
46972 things are still a little bit grim at the moment
46973 kml currently has more than 200 million in available cash reserves which will be utilized for the ongoing predevelopment activities at karara including final engineering and design work and long lead equipment items such as the recent orders totaling approximately 70 million for two high pressure grinding rolls and four large ball mills
46974 this application to ansteel eliminates the need for gindalbie to raise equity funding in the current difficult period for financial markets
46975 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
46976 you know what hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name did i mention hes black
46977 you dont need a weatherman to tell you which way the wind blows
46978 saddams goal is to achieve the lifting of u n sanctions while retaining and enhancing iraqs weapons of mass destruction programs we cannot we must not and we will not let him succeed
46979 the community of nations may see more and more of the very kind of threat iraq poses now a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction ready to use them or provide them to terrorists if we fail to respond today saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow
46980 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of september 11 2001 it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons should he succeed in that endeavor he could alter the political and security landscape of the middle east which as we know all too well affects american security
46981 i am absolutely convinced that there are weapons i saw evidence back in 1998 when we would see the inspectors being barred from gaining entry into a warehouse for three hours with trucks rolling up and then moving those trucks out
46982 i think its hard to project four years from now
46983 it is very difficult to know what were going to be inheriting
46984 if you elect us to the majority well make sure there are troops there by 2013
46985 damn it they cut us off no funding gotta send the troops home
46986 we will move to proceed to this matter before we leave here
46987 john had been counting on the unions as a sort of super charger an after burner
46988 but now we are in danger of a flame out
46989 he can beat hillary if he ties the failed bush policies to hillary
46990 im trying to have everybody understand that this is going to cost and that its going to have a measure of pain that youre not going to like
46991 today was a major step in the legal effort to clear my name the court has not issued a ruling on my motion to withdraw my guilty plea for now i will continue my work in the united states senate for idaho
46992 it is clear that the presidency is now very much
46993 and that he remains convinced that none of the candidates in the current field has captured the imagination of the party
46994 extraordinary moment because it marks the high water mark of all the many debates and resolutions weve had in terms of bipartisanship
46995 outsourcing war while filling in troop gaps has disturbing consequences
46996 blackwater would not be doing business in iraq if we still had our 1991 military capability
46997 between 2001 and 2006 we were busy creating homeland security that clinton could have done after the first attack on the world trade center in 1993
46998 it is my contention in response to an attempt to kill thousands in the u s homeland clinton could have formed and funded something like a homeland security in 1993
46999 bush initially resisted the idea of a new department which had been championed primarily by democrats in the wake of the attacks
47000 we cannot build enough prisons to solve this problem and the idea that we can keep incarcerating and keep incarcerating pretty soon were not going to have a young african american male population in america theyre all going to be in prison or dead one of the two
47001 whitwater filegate personal fbi files lost documents purjury sex in white house selling secrets to china china gate vince foster showing up dead whom the speculation goes she was having an affair with not to mention her top fundraiser was just arrested who happens to be a chinese national
47002 there was a time that made me wonder about her as an electable democratic candidate but the more i listen to those folks froth and rave the more i realize that theyre not going to vote for anyone running on the democratic ticket under any circumstances so why listen to them

47005 you may not have noticed but the old back end was getting creaky under the load of 5 million users
47006 weve seen a zillion different confusions and misspellings of del icio us over the years for example de licio us del icio us com and del licio us so moving to delicious com will make it easier for people to find the site and share it with their friends
47007 repeated attempts to engage in meaningful license terms over the past two years
47008 overall the significance is that disk encryption is not the silver bullet that we might have thought in its present state
47009 individuals and businesses that rely on disk encryption need to pay much closer attention to the physical security of their devices
47010 web based malware is a significant problem and there is no real good proactive defense against this
47011 were trying to prevent people from going to places where there is bad content but at the moment there is nothing i can tell my mother that this is what you can do to be safe
47012 having nortel and bt in place at this early stage is incredibly important because our network joins together the 26 sports in the olympic games and the 20 sports in the paralympic games
47013 it also has to link to the outside world and match the huge demand for pictures and information be it to tvs mobile phones social networks or whatever else is being used in 2012 it all has to work absolutely flawlessly over the three weeks of the games
47014 do you want to be right or do you want to be happy
47015 while dealing with a stranger common courtesy you use but the children you love you seem to abuse go and look on the kitchen floor youll find some flowers there by the door those are the flowers he brought for you he picked them himself pink yellow and blue he stood very quietly not to spoil the surprise and you never saw the tears that filled his little eyes
47016 i found em out by the tree i picked em because theyre pretty like you i knew youd like em especially the blue
47017 son im very sorry for the way i acted today i shouldnt have yelled at you that way
47018 hey craeg we are going out on insert day here would you like to go with us
47019 for every nine people who denounce innovation only one will encourage it for every nine people who do things the way they have always been done only one will wonder if there is a better way for every nine people who stand in front of a locked door only one will ever come around and check the back door our progress as a species rests squarely on the shoulders of that tenth person the nine are satisfied with things they are told are valuable person 10 determines for himself what has value
47020 combines the power of celebrity and media with 21st century grassroots organizing tactics
47021 with average performance great outdoor image quality plenty of user friendly exposure modes and a street price of us 199 or less i feel the pentax optio m50 will make a great digicam for the average consumer
47022 this camera looks big feels big and produces big images of outstanding color and detail i should emphasize that the color this camera captures is very accurate and even the finest of details are clearly visible with high quality optics what that equates to is picking up more of the textures to things
47023 for those who would like a dslr optimized for sports news and wedding photography the d3 is probably the top choice since the d3 can handle iso 3200 easily and provides very acceptable 6400 results it changes the approach to indoor and low light photography
47024 the d3 did a perfectly fine job even if the color of the lighting didnt cooperate iso 12 500 can be grainy and iso 25 600 is downright loaded with red dots but still usable when you need it
47025 our lab tests confirmed our initial reaction to the d3s impressive fixed eye level pentaprism viewfinder bright and clear it provides a field of view that covers 100 percent of the captured scene earning an excellent rating data is easy to read with no visible vignetting or light falloff across the image area
47026 the nikon d3 is a very solid and extremely responsive camera image quality is excellent the d3 seems to deliver at high iso of course we need now to get more experience with real world photos the lcd is very good like with the d300 we like the dual cf card slots
47027 for its part the full frame nikon d3 is a direct challenge to canons 1 series which has dominated the pro marketplace now for more than half a decade the 1d mkiii is right in the d3s bore sight and the d3 matches it or surpasses it in iq sensitivity and resolution
47028 skin tones and rendition should comply with stern requirements the resolution on its own is more than high enough to show every flaw of the models make up and skin irregularities however the file sizes may not suffice for making extreme enlargements
47029 the d3 images captured on 13 dec 07 werent the most dynamic music photos ive taken to date im even willing to concede that the images themselves are perhaps less interesting than the lessons ive learned with this new photographic tool however its only with a commitment to unpaid practice that i can confidentially integrate the nikon d3 into my professional photography
47030 canon has enjoyed a deserved reputation for high image quality especially at high iso but now with the d3 nikon has upped the ante producing a camera that appears to offer lower noise than canon at least against the flagship 1ds mkiii and higher available speeds as well
47031 in terms of speed or image capturing performance the d3 is probably the fastest camera weve ever had the chance to use its able to capture up to nine frames per second fps in fx full frame mode and 11fps in dx 1 5 crop mode this happens to better canons sports oriented 1d mark iii by 1fps albeit at a different resolution
47032 the noise of the d3 at high iso is about 2 to 3 stops better than the previous d2x not like the canon 1ds2 where its somewhat noise free but softer it seems the nikon looks a little sharper but when noise does show and it takes about iso 2 000 before it really appears it is more film like that most digital files i have shot
47033 nikon d3 is a reporters camera with everything a reporter needs in other words speed and low noise
47034 nikon has eclipsed the competition with the d3 a cutting edge camera that will change how professional photographers take pictures
47035 the incredible speed resolution and flexibility of the d3 will enable photographers to capture images under conditions previously thought impossible
47036 combines the power of celebrity and media with 21st century grassroots organizing tactics

47049 the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits
47050 business is not concerned merely with profit but also with promoting desirable social ends that business has a social conscience and takes seriously its responsibilities for providing em ployment eliminating discrimination avoid ing pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of re formers
47051 preach ing pure and unadulterated socialism busi nessmen who talk this way are unwitting pup pets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades
47052 there is one and only one social responsibility of business to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game which is to say engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud
47053 the most successful businesses put the customer first instead of the investors
47054 there can be little doubt that a certain amount of corporate philanthropy is simply good business and works for the long term benefit of the investors
47055 of course in practice the doctrine of social responsibility is frequently a cloak for actions that are justified on other grounds rather than a reason for those actions
47056 to illustrate it may well be in the long run interest of a corporation that is a major employer in a small community to devote resources to providing amenities to that community or to improving its government
47057 in each of these cases there is a strong temptation to rationalize these actions as an exercise of social responsibility
47058 it would be inconsistent of me to call on corporate executives to refrain from this hypocritical window dressing because it harms the foundations of a free society that would be to call on them to exercise a social responsibility if our institutions and the attitudes of the public make it in their self interest to cloak their actions in this way i cannot summon much indignation to denounce them
47059 the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits
47060 the enlightened corporation should try to create value for all of its constituencies
47061 how business and profit making fit into my overarching philosophy of altruism
47062 the differences between john mackey and me regarding the social responsibility of business are for the most part rhetorical
47063 i believe the entrepreneurs not the current investors in a companys stock have the right and responsibility to define the purpose of the company
47064 the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits
47065 the enlightened corporation should try to create value for all of its constituencies
47066 whats good for the country is good for general motors and vice versa
47067 the enlightened corporation should try to create value for all of its constituencies

47074 around the world many will be expressing disappointment about yet another collapse of the trade negotiations
47075 major gains that had been expected have now been pushed further out
47076 developing countries with some justification felt that they received little benefit from the previous round
47077 the problem was that what they viewed as an import surge might in fact be just the steady import growth that can be expected in developing countries as their demands for meat and dairy products continue to grow along with their incomes
47078 but richer countries also might have offered more to help bring about an outcome that would be of real benefit to the developing world since several rich countries subsidise production of products in which poorer countries ought to have a competitive advantage such as cotton
47079 rich countries also have very high tariffs on agri food products that impede exports from poorer countries and also make it difficult for food processing industries to become established and grow in the developing world
47080 one weirdo after another is being trotted out as somewhat familiar with barack obama
47081 the fact that such well known former establishment figures would seek a fringe partys presidential nomination demonstrates to many libertarians that their party has come of age
47082 although this may turn out to be a banner year for the libertarian party the lp is not a real alternative to the republicans and democrats
47083 would annoy or disturb the quiet comfort and repose of a reasonable person of normal sensibilities
47084 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
47085 well we had to take up arms against britain you never know so lets not abridge the right to do so
47086 i responded one time he hated that but it was true
47087 as every libertarian must they often have to go into extended explanations about theory or some civics caveat or crunch when what they are really trying to say is

47093 you are free to air your opinions but do not force them onto others
47094 an associated press tally shows at least 510 iraqi civilians and security force members were killed in july a 75 percent drop from the 2 021 deaths in the same period last year as the u s troop buildup aimed at quelling rampant sunni shiite violence was nearing its peak

47135 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
47136 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
47137 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
47138 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
47139 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
47140 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale

47142 we will not stop watching over our entire people and no one not even you will be able to take this responsibility from us
47143 to rejoice over victory by violence is to rejoice over slaughter the wise ruler sees a military triumph as a funeral
47144 if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them but the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart
47145 there is a principle which is a bar against all information which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance that principle is contempt prior to investigation
47146 men honor what lies within the sphere of their knowledge but do not realize how dependent they are on what lies beyond it
47147 what a man desires to know is that i e the external world but his means of knowing is this i e himself how can he know that only by the perfection of this
47148 to realise the relative validity of ones convictions and yet stand for them unflinchingly is what distinguishes a civilised man from a barbarian

47156 congress got a glimpse into how chemicals are regulated in this country and saw how broken the system is
47157 the phthalate ban is only the tip of the iceberg of whats needed to protect americans from unsafe chemical exposures
47158 public health advocates and parents were up against big oil and the chemical industry and we won this should serve as a wake up call to industry chemicals linked to cancer and birth defects have no place in childrens products
47159 consumers are saying that the products we buy must be safe period the phthalate ban is a great start and an indication that congress is ready to consider the kind of sweeping chemical policy reform that is needed

47164 it is my understanding that ms spears is reluctantly agreeing that we extend the temporary letters of conservatorship
47165 mr spears and mr lutfi have reached a private agreement and no hearing or order is required at this time
47166 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi
47167 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
47168 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
47169 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
47170 took everybody by surprise because the african union is a partner in the darfur issue
47171 wow thats fantastic but you need an adult to help you out because you have to be a registered voter
47172 but before we get into logistics i dont often get calls from 16 year olds can you tell me how you know about ralph
47173 two years ago mr nader came to my high school
47174 i helped organize that there was a standing room only crowd what did you think of ralphs speech

47281 while a connection between calcium regulation and alzheimers pathology has been predicted for many years this is the first direct observation of a connection between amyloid plaques calcium accumulation and a neurodegenerative mechanism in the most relevant animal model
47282 we need to keep in mind that animal models are not a complete reflection of what happens in human disease so we cant extrapolate too far down the road
47283 but our data do suggest that calcineurin inhibition should be investigated in future studies which also should look at how amyloid beta causes calcium overload and whether removing plaques really does improve neuronal health
47284 our study was carried out on female participants only and it should be recognised that there is evidence to suggest that women may be more susceptible to some of the genetically harmful effects of alcohol than men perhaps due to differences in fat to water ratio or liver mass to body weight ratio

47291 but we were surprised by how many patients returned to travel medicine clinics after travel with animal bites 400 dog bites along with some cat and monkey bites over the 10 year study and needed rabies vaccination
47292 olympic travelers need to be aware of this risk and avoid petting stray animals while in china
47293 if they are bitten they need to seek medical treatment immediately
47294 we recommend visiting a travel clinic several weeks to a month before your trip to get travel advice and make sure your vaccinations are up to date
47295 while traveling washing hands often to prevent illness and using common sense can help in decreasing your health risks

47315 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
47316 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur

47325 theyre taking a noncustodial routine booking form and then turning around and saying now were going to use this as a basis to charge you with a crime

47327 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
47328 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
47329 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
47330 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
47331 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
47332 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
47333 i agree with it and im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying

47420 mas se era certo e tra ado como poderia ter desviado do caminho
47421 n o importa inexor vel e irresist vel o teu destino
47422 por que sempre que se fala em destino e coisas afins usamos termos que n o cabem no dia a dia
47423 n o me conteste vil criatura s apenas pueril espectador da transeunte efem ride

47457 n o a minha sina mas voc nunca quis saber disso n
47458 nem sou voc que nunca quis me conhecer de perto a fundo mas isso hist ria de cinco anos atr s quando eu te cantei pela primeira vez e levei um toco hom rico
47459 pois bom quando estiver recuperada da ressaca ou da amiga me liga
47460 haha n o s tive o azar de ter nome de deus grego ou n o
47461 voc diz isso porque n o me viu s de meias ainda
47462 trabalha com livros ou com programas de computador ou uma lojinha
47463 porque a parte mais importante ainda n o foi dita ontem tu n o estavas em condi es preferi que descansasses assim que quiseres podemos tratar da verdadeira raz o da minha vinda
47464 a raz o de eu ter vindo aqui para te dar a boa nova est s livre a pedido de algu m que te ama
47465 daquilo que vimos ontem agora que sabes das raz es pelas quais n o te permites amar podes pensar se o teu desejo continuar vivendo assim ou viver sem medo do amor
47466 agora estou confuso voc n o veio aqui pra mandar que eu voltasse para a michelle n o foi por isso que voc veio aqui
47467 n o vim para te mostrar por que raz o tu foges de toda namorada que demonstra te amar de verdade mas a decis o cabe a ti
47468 muito pelo contr rio eu j te dei mais do que deverias ter recebido tens em tuas m os a oportunidade de ouro de resgatares o amor do passado
47469 n o assim t o f cil garanto que a michelle j deve ter um namorado novo ela deve ter mandado aquele email pra me preparar psicologicamente um dia vou dar de cara com os dois
47470 sandro por que te julgas t o desprez vel queres saber a verdade eu te direi cec lia abriu a caixa quando voc foi embora da festa de quinze anos dela olhou as alian as chorou e passou seis meses te esperando n o te procurou porque sentiu vergonha por ter feito coisa t o dura contigo est casada gr vida de um menino que j decidiu batizar com o teu nome leila at hoje tem aquele bicho de pel cia que tu deste na comemora o do primeiro m s de namoro tamara j quis te ligar v rias vezes para marcar um encontro mas tem medo de parecer uma mulher oferecida e michelle bom eu n o devia falar sobre essa
47471 acontece sandro que ela est contigo por causa das ora es dela que me foi ordenado descer terra e n o estou dizendo isso para que acredites que tens que ir at ela n o o meu prop sito aqui meu prop sito liberta lo
47472 ela n o est pedindo pra voc juntar a gente de novo
47473 n o ela est rezando para que tenhas paz de esp rito para decidires o que melhor e s terias essa paz se entendesses o motivo da tua ang stia exatamente por essa raz o estou aqui e tu s livre livre para decidir o que queres
47474 mas voc s n o costumam fazer assim n o s na b blia tem esses relatos de anjo daqui anjo dali dando orienta es etc ser que eu sou t o importante assim ou ser a michelle
47475 rapazinho eu n o estou autorizado a falar dos nossos m todos de opera o mas j que est s me provocando eu te explicarei n o voc s n o v o gerar um filho iluminado nem s o t o importantes assim s o gente pequena como todos s o e deus cuida de todos igualmente desde que estejam dispostos mas pra responder sua pergunta deus n o nos envia mais para dizer o que melhor mas utilizamos o potencial multiplicador de cada ato
47476 essa tua hist ria vai ser comentada com dois que v o comentar com mais oito um deles vai escrever num email 57 314 pessoas v o ler a mensagem ao longo de 12 meses desses h 8 749 pessoas que estar o passando por um momento semelhante ao seu e que encontrar o sentido no que est escrito por fim uma pessoa vai fazer um conto sobre toda essa hist ria que vai ser publicada num site sendo lida por 54 812 pessoas sendo que mais 11 103 v o entender a mensagem dessa hist ria como um sinal para si mesmas compreendeu milhares de pessoas que nem sequer v o saber quem s v o se beneficiar deus trabalha assim
47477 o mais importante no teu caso que compreendas que s livre esque as disso que falei agora n o te preocupes com as tarefas deixa as a cargo do alt ssimo a tua obriga o s uma viver quanto a mim agora devo partir
47478 n o sei eu sabia que tinha que correr s isso
47479 bom agora eu vou explicar a tua vida s um coment rio deus onisciente logo ele sempre est certo n o te preocupes em tentar dizer que estou errado porque n o estou ou a e reflita
47480 n o voc muito feio mam e falou que eu vou casar com um menino bonito quando eu for grande
47481 n o s quero fazer um bolo gostoso e mostrar pra tia
47482 por isso que guardas tantas marcas do passado n o olhas para ti mesmo preferes que a tua mente s escondidas te encha de traumas percebes o que houve a foste rejeitado e desde ent o passaste a te sentires assim como se ningu m fosse aceitar te como s
47483 sim guardaste esse sentimento de rejei o desde ent o em rela o a todas as pessoas que o cercam por isso quando te entristeces acabas te afastando de todos o que te amam para n o correres o risco de seres rejeitado de repetires essa cena boba que viveu no jardim da inf ncia infelizmente n o compreendes que essas horas de tristeza s o os momentos nos quais os que te amam s o ainda mais importantes para ti
47484 mais do que isso como n o quiseste abrir m o da amizade com celso preferiste abrir m o dos sonhos rom nticos com essa menina s que estendeste esse pensamento para todas as garotas a partir da n o permitiste que tua mente deixasse outra menina habitar os teus sonhos at os dez anos de idade mesmo depois aprendeste a destruir os sonhos que o teu cora o insiste em ter
47485 essa cena faz parte do meu problema com mulheres o que ela quer dizer
47486 n o quer dizer nada essa cena foi a respons vel pela tua primeira ere o s deixei aqui para que percebesses como s pat tico ali s todos voc s s o
47487 sandro me escute n o precisas cultivar essa dor nem precisas ter medo de que aconte a de novo nenhuma das tuas namoradas posteriores seria capaz de causar um sofrimento parecido no entanto tu te afastaste de todas elas quanta dor tens causado a ti mesmo e a elas pelo medo de sentires dor novamente
47488 eu n o posso passei meses chorando por causa da cec lia n o quero mais que isso aconte a n o vou permitir
47489 e para que isso n o aconte a preferes repetir essa mesma hist ria na tua cabe a todos os dias s que a cec lia j passou as outras namoradas n o eram a cec lia nem poderiam ser e insistes em trata las da mesma forma
47490 por dois motivos o primeiro simples mereces encarar isso de frente para que possas aprender a li o que te foi ensinada e que ainda n o reconheceste entenda sandro que uma dor deve ser sentida e esquecida ou estar s fadado a revive la e senti la pelo resto de tua vida s quando entenderes isso que ser s livre o segundo para que aprendas que podes voltar atr s quando cometeres os teus erros nunca tarde para reverteres a situa o ainda mais por causa do amor e isso tem a ver com algo de muito importante que ainda devo te falar est s preparado para ouvir
47491 tecnicamente tudo deus ele o universo mas se prefere outra perspectiva eu sou s um anjo dos menores diga se de passagem proporcional tarefa
47492 n o sandro se voc tivesse morrido estaria passando por uma situa o um pouco mais desconfort vel eu vim conversar
47493 mas mas espera a eu devo estar sonhando onde j se viu aparecer um anjo na minha frente e aquelas coisas de falar na nossa mente de nos dar intui o n o assim que deus trabalha
47494 mas s com quem lhe d ouvidos e n o o seu caso voc n o ouviu o sussurro de deus nem o conselho daquela senhora no supermercado nem o seu melhor amigo ningu m quando o caso complicado deus resolve de um jeito mais incisivo
47495 preste aten o eu vim para clarear as suas id ias pare de se questionar isso real agora uma coisa importante eu n o estou aqui para obrig lo a nada voc quem escolhe mas parece que voc n o tem condi es suficientes para tomar a decis o se estivesse pronto nem mesmo o sonho de ontem teria abalado voc mas abalou n o foi
47496 o que eu vim fazer aqui muito simples eu vou falar sobre voc e a conversa tem um pouco a ver com uma mo a chamada michelle voc e ela podem estar separados por motivos inadequados n o deveriam estar assim distantes e sofrendo
47497 pera mas quem est sofrendo eu estou bem ou melhor estava bem at o sonho de ontem voc s que devem estar armando alguma coisa pr cima de mim
47498 infelizmente eu s vim para conversar n o posso fazer o que eu deveria com um blasfemador como voc mas tudo a seu tempo voc vai me dar ouvidos ou n o
47499 percebeu que voc terminou o namoro porque constatou que voc s estavam indo bem
47500 n o foi isso a quest o que do jeito que a coisa estava indo ela ia come ar a falar em casamento eu n o posso pensar em casamento nem terminei a faculdade ainda nem tenho emprego sou jovem demais n o d
47501 ela ia come ar a falar em casamento voc j estava pensando na possibilidade por que ela n o poderia
47502 porque a n s amos casar n o parece bvio
47503 e se eu lhe disser que aquilo que voc teve ontem n o era um sonho se eu disser que ontem voc viveu um dia de casado com ela o que voc me diz
47504 tamb m n o era realidade mas n o era sonho a quest o que poss vel s depende de voc s mas de uma forma que voc classifica como racional voc abriu m o da companhia dela se isso racionalidade o que n o seria
47505 n o sandro quem n o est me entendendo voc acho que est na hora de termos uma conversa mais baseada em fatos venha c vou te mostrar uma coisa espero que voc tenha coragem de ver
47506 espero que voc tenha prazer em conhecer esse voc por essas raz es que voc n o quer saber de relacionamentos s rios
47507 bom se eu dormi s duas era pr ter acordado com o despertador gritando a n o ser que que eu tenha ido tirar uma soneca antes do jantar e tenha pego num sono profundo emendando at agora
47508 que nada ontem eu dormi cedo pr caramba nem jantei
47509 t maluco merm o a gente se encontrou no chat de paquera era voc ou era um hacker usando a tua conta
47510 vou correr pr casa pode ser que a michelle pe a
47511 l vamos n s de novo agora teremos que fazer de outro jeito
47512 muito prazer voc nunca vai saber o meu verdadeiro nome mas pode me chamar de deus

47514 amor n o vai se atrasar voc sabe que o tavares um chato com hor rios
47515 como ela veio parar aqui n s terminamos isso imposs vel ela deve ter me embebedado e me trazido para a casa dela s pode ser mas o pai dela vai me matar quando der de cara comigo como ela me seduziu e por que raz o eu aceitei vir pr c eu devo ter pirado droga n o pode ser eu queria ficar mais tempo sozinho n o era pr eu ter cedido no primeiro reencontro
47516 ah j sei sonhou com algo estranho de novo meu amor eu vou esperar voc sair do banheiro pr me levantar n o esque a de me acordar t

47532 conforme se no pr ximo ano notar que o que cresce numa velocidade ainda maior o seu nariz voc e seu nariz est o ficando velhos
47533 passar um perfume pelamordedeus que ningu m era obrigado a sentir a minha catinga
47534 isso n o se entregue facilmente mande todos eles passearem
47535 invento desculpas provoco uma briga digo que n o estou vivo num clip sem nexo um pierrot retrocesso meio bossa nova e rockn roll
47536 nem toda mulher gosta de apanhar s as normais as neur ticas reagem

47538 se conselho fosse bom n o se dava se vendia
47539 sabe cara t dif cil voltar a escrever eu n o consigo mais me inspirar para porra nenhuma acho que perdi o dom da coisa
47540 que voc fazia o g nero de poeta tuberculoso cara agora t feliz e n o encontra o caminho antigo das palavras
47541 pode ser isso ou ent o que as musas os temas me fogem eu perco as noites e n o acho em mim vontade de mais nada
47542 nem n o me lembro de ter estado t o feliz antes eu me remexo na cama coloco uma m sica no sonzinho da cabeceira e n o encontro a ang stia que me fazia escrever
47543 eu tamb m t com bloqueio de escritor ou o as vozes que me contam os contos que me os sussurram na calada mas n o consigo mais sentar ao computador e escrever palavra as m sicas continuam me prendendo num loop eterno
47544 entra a m sica a danada da carla bruni e n o fa o mais nada t perdido
47545 pode ser mas escrever paix o e paix o desequil brio como andar um exerc cio de corte com a queda um ensaia o tombo e o p segura na raz o e assim andamos passo a passo palavra a palavra
47546 os par grafos pensados e encadeados isso a mas ela me d paz e na paz fico amarrado
47547 te contei quem divide a minha cama agora a aline
47548 n o brinca s rio porra cara tu n o homem bastante para ela tem esse jeito bobo desengon ado sem gra a
47549 eu sei tamb m acho isso eu acordo de noite e fico olhando para ela meio embasbacado ela ali nua e eu fico medindo a minha sorte a sorte de um merda de um poeta frustrado e funcionariozinho de uma porra de empresa de webdesign webwriter de c com acento rola mas isso que t me fazendo levantar cada dia e encarar mais um dia de fgts isso a vontade de ser um homem mais merecedor daquela deusa que divide o suor e o gozo comigo essa mulher maravilhosa que me d o prazer de dividir a sua intimidade
47550 cara voc quebrou a regra n mero um do artista n o se come a musa
47551 s rio teu motor de inspira o era o amor n o resolvido desfiado em papel teus melhores textos eram aqueles que ficavam ali no fio da navalha entre a corte para a conquista essa dan a de acasalamento moderna e a punheta da paix o plat nica era ali na penumbra que voc se encontrava
47552 voc queria que eu fizesse o qu nunca fui bom nessa merda de cantada de cortejar sempre me perdi nesses dois lados do muro nunca sabia se pedia o telefone ou email
47553 se eu pedisse o telefone significava que eu j ia para a abordagem apontava a proa do navio e abalroava a menina se eu pedisse o email era para ficar na cantada insossa no cerca louren o que se convencionou chamar a corte hoje em dia
47554 te disse nunca fui bom nisso eu acabo que me atiro antes dos sinais de permiss o e invado o espa o alheio me fazendo querer s que nem sempre o outro lado t sabendo das regras do jogo e nunca combina resultado n
47555 ent o ela veio entendeu o jogo antes de eu colocar as regras me desarmou se instalou tornou se parte da decora o do meu quarto
47556 quem tem medo do fim n o deve nem come ar

47609 plamen telmekov nasceu em plovdiv bulgaria em 1961 ele se define como um artista neo impressionista ao observar seus quadros percebe se que o artista ao pintar os personagens em movimento procurou faz lo de forma est tica como se tivesse o poder de controlar o tempo congelando o momento no espa o imortalizando assim os personagens em suas telas as luzes s o representadas por cores chapadas com pinceladas largas gosto particularmente da forma como ele enfatiza os gestos as m os a express o corporal ao mesmo tempo deixa de forma indefinida os rostos como se n o tivesse import ncia se diferenciando por exemplo das obras de maria amaral que tamb m representam o movimento no caso de jia lu a sua express o corporal representada de forma quase fotogr fica j maria amaral concede grande import ncia aos rostos seus corpos praticamente se fundem no ato do movimento

47657 artista indiano que expressa em sua arte a dualidade entre o real e o espiritual suas formas misturam o realismo e o figurativo com cores extremamente vibrantes e expressivas o artista prefere trabalhar com as t cnicas de pastel acr lico e guache em suportes como o papel lona e tela
47658 eu tenho feito isto desde que me entendo por gente eu n o posso viver sem arte muito muda em n s medida que os anos passam a press o as cores e as perguntas que nos fazemos mudam com o tempo uma coisa permanece imut vel o desejo de esconder a si mesmo na clausura de uma arte viver em um mundo parte e sentir se parte de um universo maravilhoso e eterno e encarar deus com todos os seus segredos e afetos ocultos
47659 minha inspira o vem da realidade di ria que eu apago esfrego anulo a princ pio e depois progressivamente reconstituo expulsando toda a esc ria ou elementos in teis a fim de alcan ar o m ximo efeito significante quando eu come o um desenho estou sempre preocupada em descobrir se eu vou poder comunicar minhas id ias claro que no momento em que estou pintando eu me sinto feliz em outro lugar em um mundo diferente mas depois v m as d vidas realidade retorna um momento dram tico mas revigorante com toda minha sensibilidade eu quero testemunhar a ang stia de viver em um mundo onde tudo se desintegra onde tudo sujeito a questionamentos onde a injusti a vive lado a lado com os maiores auto sacrif cios onde constantemente a esperan a colide contra a d vida mais negativa

47681 a b blia cont m cada tema e tom imagin vel e deus frequentemente indistinguivel dos deuses tribais das sociedades primitivas pelo menos nos termos de esp rito vingativo ou de hostilidade para a ra a humana o milagre da b blia pode ser descrita como cada palavra escrita nela a palavra de deus exata como ele queria que fosse escrita mas um milagre ainda maiorpoderia ser descrito como este apesar de ser o produto da hist ria do erro da pol tica e da cada outra falha da natureza humana a b blia controla e contem a palavra de deus se n s tivermos somente a humildade para a ver
47682 the bible contains every theme and tone imaginable and god is often indistinguishable from the tribal gods of primitive societies at least in terms of vengefulness or hostility toward the human race for an unquestioning believer the miracle of the bible may be that every word of it is the exact word of god as he meant it to be but an even greater miracle could be described like this in spite of being the product of history error politics and every other flaw of human nature the bible still manages to contain the word of god if we only have the humility to see it

47837 is going on but incredibly as it may seem weve
47838 where is that lady who is always here at this time
47839 although it is a cliche to which we are so familiar that we dont even notice it implies very interesting thoughts in the way it expresses some kind of deeply heartfelt desire doesnt it
47840 passar um perfume pelamordedeus que ningu m era obrigado a sentir a minha catinga
47841 isso n o se entregue facilmente mande todos eles passearem
47842 invento desculpas provoco uma briga digo que n o estou vivo num clip sem nexo um pierrot retrocesso meio bossa nova e rockn roll
47843 nem toda mulher gosta de apanhar s as normais as neur ticas reagem
47844 t o bonita e inteligente como voc n o estar casada e n o ter filhos
47845 se conselho fosse bom n o se dava se vendia
47846 sabe cara t dif cil voltar a escrever eu n o consigo mais me inspirar para porra nenhuma acho que perdi o dom da coisa
47847 que voc fazia o g nero de poeta tuberculoso cara agora t feliz e n o encontra o caminho antigo das palavras
47848 pode ser isso ou ent o que as musas os temas me fogem eu perco as noites e n o acho em mim vontade de mais nada
47849 nem n o me lembro de ter estado t o feliz antes eu me remexo na cama coloco uma m sica no sonzinho da cabeceira e n o encontro a ang stia que me fazia escrever
47850 eu tamb m t com bloqueio de escritor ou o as vozes que me contam os contos que me os sussurram na calada mas n o consigo mais sentar ao computador e escrever palavra as m sicas continuam me prendendo num loop eterno
47851 entra a m sica a danada da carla bruni e n o fa o mais nada t perdido
47852 pode ser mas escrever paix o e paix o desequil brio como andar um exerc cio de corte com a queda um ensaia o tombo e o p segura na raz o e assim andamos passo a passo palavra a palavra
47853 os par grafos pensados e encadeados isso a mas ela me d paz e na paz fico amarrado
47854 te contei quem divide a minha cama agora a aline
47855 n o brinca s rio porra cara tu n o homem bastante para ela tem esse jeito bobo desengon ado sem gra a
47856 eu sei tamb m acho isso eu acordo de noite e fico olhando para ela meio embasbacado ela ali nua e eu fico medindo a minha sorte a sorte de um merda de um poeta frustrado e funcionariozinho de uma porra de empresa de webdesign webwriter de c com acento rola mas isso que t me fazendo levantar cada dia e encarar mais um dia de fgts isso a vontade de ser um homem mais merecedor daquela deusa que divide o suor e o gozo comigo essa mulher maravilhosa que me d o prazer de dividir a sua intimidade
47857 cara voc quebrou a regra n mero um do artista n o se come a musa
47858 s rio teu motor de inspira o era o amor n o resolvido desfiado em tinta e papel teus melhores textos eram aqueles que ficavam ali no fio da navalha entre a corte para a conquista essa dan a de acasalamento moderna e a punheta da paix o plat nica era ali na penumbra que voc se encontrava
47859 voc queria que eu fizesse o qu nunca fui bom nessa merda de cantada de cortejar sempre me perdi nesses dois lados do muro nunca sabia se pedia o telefone ou email
47860 se eu pedisse o telefone significava que eu j ia para a abordagem apontava a proa do navio e abalroava a menina se eu pedisse o email era para ficar na cantada insossa no cerca louren o que se convencionou chamar a corte hoje em dia
47861 te disse nunca fui bom nisso eu acabo que me atiro antes dos sinais de permiss o e invado o espa o alheio me fazendo querer s que nem sempre o outro lado t sabendo das regras do jogo e nunca combina resultado n
47862 ent o ela veio entendeu o jogo antes de eu colocar as regras me desarmou se instalou tornou se parte da decora o do meu quarto
47863 quem tem medo do fim n o deve nem come ar
47864 porque a parte mais importante ainda n o foi dita ontem tu n o estavas em condi es preferi que descansasses assim que quiseres podemos tratar da verdadeira raz o da minha vinda
47865 a raz o de eu ter vindo aqui para te dar a boa nova est s livre a pedido de algu m que te ama
47866 daquilo que vimos ontem agora que sabes das raz es pelas quais n o te permites amar podes pensar se o teu desejo continuar vivendo assim ou viver sem medo do amor
47867 agora estou confuso voc n o veio aqui pra mandar que eu voltasse para a michelle n o foi por isso que voc veio aqui
47868 n o vim para te mostrar por que raz o tu foges de toda namorada que demonstra te amar de verdade mas a decis o cabe a ti
47869 muito pelo contr rio eu j te dei mais do que deverias ter recebido tens em tuas m os a oportunidade de ouro de resgatares o amor do passado
47870 n o assim t o f cil garanto que a michelle j deve ter um namorado novo ela deve ter mandado aquele email pra me preparar psicologicamente um dia vou dar de cara com os dois
47871 sandro por que te julgas t o desprez vel queres saber a verdade eu te direi cec lia abriu a caixa quando voc foi embora da festa de quinze anos dela olhou as alian as chorou e passou seis meses te esperando n o te procurou porque sentiu vergonha por ter feito coisa t o dura contigo est casada gr vida de um menino que j decidiu batizar com o teu nome leila at hoje tem aquele bicho de pel cia que tu deste na comemora o do primeiro m s de namoro tamara j quis te ligar v rias vezes para marcar um encontro mas tem medo de parecer uma mulher oferecida e michelle bom eu n o devia falar sobre essa
47872 acontece sandro que ela est contigo por causa das ora es dela que me foi ordenado descer terra e n o estou dizendo isso para que acredites que tens que ir at ela n o o meu prop sito aqui meu prop sito liberta lo
47873 ela n o est pedindo pra voc juntar a gente de novo
47874 n o ela est rezando para que tenhas paz de esp rito para decidires o que melhor e s terias essa paz se entendesses o motivo da tua ang stia exatamente por essa raz o estou aqui e tu s livre livre para decidir o que queres
47875 mas voc s n o costumam fazer assim n o s na b blia tem esses relatos de anjo daqui anjo dali dando orienta es etc ser que eu sou t o importante assim ou ser a michelle
47876 rapazinho eu n o estou autorizado a falar dos nossos m todos de opera o mas j que est s me provocando eu te explicarei n o voc s n o v o gerar um filho iluminado nem s o t o importantes assim s o gente pequena como todos s o e deus cuida de todos igualmente desde que estejam dispostos mas pra responder sua pergunta deus n o nos envia mais para dizer o que melhor mas utilizamos o potencial multiplicador de cada ato
47877 essa tua hist ria vai ser comentada com dois que v o comentar com mais oito um deles vai escrever num email 57 314 pessoas v o ler a mensagem ao longo de 12 meses desses h 8 749 pessoas que estar o passando por um momento semelhante ao seu e que encontrar o sentido no que est escrito por fim uma pessoa vai fazer um conto sobre toda essa hist ria que vai ser publicada num site sendo lida por 54 812 pessoas sendo que mais 11 103 v o entender a mensagem dessa hist ria como um sinal para si mesmas compreendeu milhares de pessoas que nem sequer v o saber quem s v o se beneficiar deus trabalha assim
47878 o mais importante no teu caso que compreendas que s livre esque as disso que falei agora n o te preocupes com as tarefas deixa as a cargo do alt ssimo a tua obriga o s uma viver quanto a mim agora devo partir
47879 n o sei eu sabia que tinha que correr s isso
47880 bom agora eu vou explicar a tua vida s um coment rio deus onisciente logo ele sempre est certo n o te preocupes em tentar dizer que estou errado porque n o estou ou a e reflita
47881 n o voc muito feio mam e falou que eu vou casar com um menino bonito quando eu for grande
47882 n o s quero fazer um bolo gostoso e mostrar pra tia
47883 por isso que guardas tantas marcas do passado n o olhas para ti mesmo preferes que a tua mente s escondidas te encha de traumas percebes o que houve a foste rejeitado e desde ent o passaste a te sentires assim como se ningu m fosse aceitar te como s
47884 sim guardaste esse sentimento de rejei o desde ent o em rela o a todas as pessoas que o cercam por isso quando te entristeces acabas te afastando de todos o que te amam para n o correres o risco de seres rejeitado de repetires essa cena boba que viveu no jardim da inf ncia infelizmente n o compreendes que essas horas de tristeza s o os momentos nos quais os que te amam s o ainda mais importantes para ti
47885 mais do que isso como n o quiseste abrir m o da amizade com celso preferiste abrir m o dos sonhos rom nticos com essa menina s que estendeste esse pensamento para todas as garotas a partir da n o permitiste que tua mente deixasse outra menina habitar os teus sonhos at os dez anos de idade mesmo depois aprendeste a destruir os sonhos que o teu cora o insiste em ter
47886 essa cena faz parte do meu problema com mulheres o que ela quer dizer
47887 n o quer dizer nada essa cena foi a respons vel pela tua primeira ere o s deixei aqui para que percebesses como s pat tico ali s todos voc s s o
47888 sandro me escute n o precisas cultivar essa dor nem precisas ter medo de que aconte a de novo nenhuma das tuas namoradas posteriores seria capaz de causar um sofrimento parecido no entanto tu te afastaste de todas elas quanta dor tens causado a ti mesmo e a elas pelo medo de sentires dor novamente
47889 eu n o posso passei meses chorando por causa da cec lia n o quero mais que isso aconte a n o vou permitir
47890 e para que isso n o aconte a preferes repetir essa mesma hist ria na tua cabe a todos os dias s que a cec lia j passou as outras namoradas n o eram a cec lia nem poderiam ser e insistes em trata las da mesma forma
47891 por dois motivos o primeiro simples mereces encarar isso de frente para que possas aprender a li o que te foi ensinada e que ainda n o reconheceste entenda sandro que uma dor deve ser sentida e esquecida ou estar s fadado a revive la e senti la pelo resto de tua vida s quando entenderes isso que ser s livre o segundo para que aprendas que podes voltar atr s quando cometeres os teus erros nunca tarde para reverteres a situa o ainda mais por causa do amor e isso tem a ver com algo de muito importante que ainda devo te falar est s preparado para ouvir
47892 tecnicamente tudo deus ele o universo mas se prefere outra perspectiva eu sou s um anjo dos menores diga se de passagem proporcional tarefa
47893 n o sandro se voc tivesse morrido estaria passando por uma situa o um pouco mais desconfort vel eu vim conversar
47894 mas mas espera a eu devo estar sonhando onde j se viu aparecer um anjo na minha frente e aquelas coisas de falar na nossa mente de nos dar intui o n o assim que deus trabalha
47895 mas s com quem lhe d ouvidos e n o o seu caso voc n o ouviu o sussurro de deus nem o conselho daquela senhora no supermercado nem o seu melhor amigo ningu m quando o caso complicado deus resolve de um jeito mais incisivo
47896 preste aten o eu vim para clarear as suas id ias pare de se questionar isso real agora uma coisa importante eu n o estou aqui para obrig lo a nada voc quem escolhe mas parece que voc n o tem condi es suficientes para tomar a decis o se estivesse pronto nem mesmo o sonho de ontem teria abalado voc mas abalou n o foi
47897 o que eu vim fazer aqui muito simples eu vou falar sobre voc e a conversa tem um pouco a ver com uma mo a chamada michelle voc e ela podem estar separados por motivos inadequados n o deveriam estar assim distantes e sofrendo
47898 pera mas quem est sofrendo eu estou bem ou melhor estava bem at o sonho de ontem voc s que devem estar armando alguma coisa pr cima de mim
47899 infelizmente eu s vim para conversar n o posso fazer o que eu deveria com um blasfemador como voc mas tudo a seu tempo voc vai me dar ouvidos ou n o
47900 percebeu que voc terminou o namoro porque constatou que voc s estavam indo bem
47901 n o foi isso a quest o que do jeito que a coisa estava indo ela ia come ar a falar em casamento eu n o posso pensar em casamento nem terminei a faculdade ainda nem tenho emprego sou jovem demais n o d
47902 ela ia come ar a falar em casamento voc j estava pensando na possibilidade por que ela n o poderia
47903 porque a n s amos casar n o parece bvio
47904 e se eu lhe disser que aquilo que voc teve ontem n o era um sonho se eu disser que ontem voc viveu um dia de casado com ela o que voc me diz
47905 tamb m n o era realidade mas n o era sonho a quest o que poss vel s depende de voc s mas de uma forma que voc classifica como racional voc abriu m o da companhia dela se isso racionalidade o que n o seria
47906 n o sandro quem n o est me entendendo voc acho que est na hora de termos uma conversa mais baseada em fatos venha c vou te mostrar uma coisa espero que voc tenha coragem de ver
47907 bom se eu dormi s duas era pr ter acordado com o despertador gritando a n o ser que que eu tenha ido tirar uma soneca antes do jantar e tenha pego num sono profundo emendando at agora
47908 que nada ontem eu dormi cedo pr caramba nem jantei
47909 t maluco merm o a gente se encontrou no chat de paquera era voc ou era um hacker usando a tua conta
47910 vou correr pr casa pode ser que a michelle pe a

47912 oh meu deus devo ter bebido muito como foi que eu entrei em casa acompanhado sem meus pais saberem
47913 amor n o vai se atrasar voc sabe que o tavares um chato com hor rios
47914 como ela veio parar aqui n s terminamos isso imposs vel ela deve ter me embebedado e me trazido para a casa dela s pode ser mas o pai dela vai me matar quando der de cara comigo como ela me seduziu e por que raz o eu aceitei vir pr c eu devo ter pirado droga n o pode ser eu queria ficar mais tempo sozinho n o era pr eu ter cedido no primeiro reencontro
47915 ah j sei sonhou com algo estranho de novo meu amor eu vou esperar voc sair do banheiro pr me levantar n o esque a de me acordar t
47916 n o oras o mesmo banheiro desde que nos mudamos

47928 tinha dito n o quando deveria ter dito sim e o carma
47929 ia carreg lo de volta ao que era tido como certo tra ado
47930 mas se era certo e tra ado como poderia ter desviado do caminho
47931 n o importa inexor vel e irresist vel o teu destino
47932 por que sempre que se fala em destino e coisas afins usamos termos que n o cabem no dia a dia
47933 n o me conteste vil criatura s apenas pueril espectador da transeunte efem ride
47934 verdade mas isso tamb m n o importa vai l e segue o teu caminho
47935 eu posso falar de mim para os outros falar dos amores errados das coisas que me arrependo da mem ria que n o quer ficar quieta das pessoas do passado perto que me surgiram no intermezzo das quietudes e de como eu me comovo quando ou o o beach boys e lembro dela e de que mesmo achando que tudo errado que n o tem de ser que n o h mais o que fazer quando as coisas chegam nesse estado ainda sinto uma vontade enorme de correr noite na beira da praia do posto seis at o leme e berrar eu te amo de que eu vi a merda de um futuro a dois e neguei o por estupidez surto ou desespero e todo dia quando acordo n o sei se estou vivendo o meu destino ou o meu erro e por isso tenho de sentar na frente de papel pena e tinta e colocar o f gado do lado do copo at esvazi lo da bile destilando o nanquim
47936 faz assim n o tenho nome para voc se quiser sou chaac

48112 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
48113 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
48114 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
48115 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
48116 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
48117 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues

48123 i will say that without this action which we hope the north will take the de listing will not occur on that time line

48259 the return of d amp o litigation trends driving increasing costs and frequency of litigation against corporate directors and officers
48260 declining securities class action filings in recent years have raised the question of whether the strictures of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 have worked heralding a new era of greater transparency less fraud and hence fewer cases particularly those against directors and officers
48261 on the contrary were seeing a marked increase in securities class action litigation and a significant increase in case values for instance 2007 securities class action settlements exceeded those in previous years by 15 percent to 46 percent depending upon the measurement
48262 there are some common characteristics and elements in these cases but certainly the most important driver is increasing investor losses and a significant driver of those losses today are the credit and subprime problems
48263 it appears that recently filed cases seek greater damages than those filed in prior years which may translate into even more expensive settlements and judgments in the future

48544 the b2 rating also incorporates the weak prospects for the radio industry which moodys believes is mature faces strategic threats from alternative media and is under secular and cyclical pressures the outdoor advertising sector has had favorable growth trends and is relatively more resilient but not completely immune to the impact of the current economic environment notably neither the ratings nor the rating outlook incorporate the potential for a precipitous fall off in advertising and the companys revenue base stemming from a severe economic downturn moodys expects clear channel will generate positive albeit modest free cash flow assuming cash payment of interest on the pik toggle notes over the intermediate term and utilize it to moderately reduce debt moodys also expects the company to use proceeds from asset sales to pay down debt the caa1 rating of clear channels legacy senior notes that remain outstanding reflects their subordination to the material amount of the companys new senior secured credit facilities and the new senior notes as the collateral package will be structured so as to not trigger the equal and ratable clause under the indentures governing the existing senior notes

48656 eu comecei a manifestar os sintomas sem saber que estava infectada tive v rias pneumonias um resfriado atr s do outro e ningu m me pediu um exame de hiv acho muito importante informar que muitos m dicos s o completamente desinformados sobre aids por exemplo j ouvi m dicos dizendo que s poss vel pegar aids quando o homem tem uma ejacula o completa o que n o verdade aquela primeira gotinha de l quido seminal j suficiente para infectar a parceira outra balela que j ouvi de m dicos que o coito interrompido seria suficiente para evitar a infec o

48715 a nega o acontece quando a realidade t o dura que a pessoa n o consegue suport la e come a a viver uma ilus o por exemplo se uma mulher sabe que o marido a est traindo pode decidir fingir que n o sabe e levar o casamento aos trancos e barrancos durante anos porque admitir a realidade a obrigaria a tomar uma atitude no caso do hiv a pessoa se contamina e ao adotar a nega o como sa da passando a acreditar em uma ilus o ela troca de emprego arruma outro namorado muda de cidade essa uma rea o seri ssima porque ela pode desenvolver doen as oportunistas cr nicas e tamb m transmitir o v rus para outras pessoas por isso importante o trabalho multidisciplinar junto ao soropositivo n o adianta o infectologista por exemplo florear o resultado do exame dizendo que est bom mas vamos come ar a medica o assim mesmo o certo dizer a verdade olha seu exame n o est bom o que voc anda fazendo est dormindo direito se alimentando bem tem bebido ultimamente anda estressado enfim a realidade dura mas melhor lidar com essa dureza do que neg la outra rea o de nega o o caso das pessoas que fogem do exame por medo de ver um mau resultado por que n o v o ao infectologista e n o fazem o exame por uma falta de fortalecimento interior essa pessoa n o se sente capaz de lidar com a realidade do resultado do exame h v rios fatores interligados quando se fala em nega o a m dia tamb m um fator importante porque transmite muitas informa es que eram verdadeiras cinco anos atr s mas que hoje j est o defasadas por exemplo eu assisti outro dia um comercial na tv patrocinado pelo minist rio da sa de em que uma mulher supostamente uma advogada dizia eu tenho aids olhando para mim ningu m diz que eu tenho aids e assim por diante a eu fiquei pensando ser que ela tem aids mesmo ou est s infectada pelo v rus ou seja as informa es sobre o hiv aids viraram um balaio de gatos em que ningu m mais entende do que est se falando se as informa es fossem dirigidas s causas do sofrimento das pessoas esse sofrimento diminuiria e n o existiria todo esse p nico em torno do diagn stico e veja n s estamos falando do brasil que considerado modelo no combate aids um pa s que divulga informa es n o t o corretamente quanto deveria mas ainda divulga alguma coisa e distribui medicamentos e preservativos terr vel imaginar a situa o em pa ses onde a nega o institucionalizada onde n o existe distribui o de medicamentos em que a religi o pro ba as mulheres de mostrar o rosto como falar sobre aids hiv se inevitavelmente para abordar o assunto preciso falar sobre sexualidade e sexo a nega o tamb m pode ser induzida pela religi o e nessa rea pode ter conseq ncias terr veis por exemplo eu tive um paciente que estava muito bem com a carga viral zerada isto indetect vel o que significa carga viral indetect vel significa apenas que a quantidade de v rus no sangue t o baixa que ele n o detectado pelo exame mas n o sin nimo de exame hiv negativo isso n o existe uma vez infectado infectado para sempre mas esse paciente dizia que estava curado que jesus o havia curado quando ele foi desafiado pelos membros do grupo a fazer novo exame ele n o compareceu mais s reuni es acreditar em milagres uma quest o muito pessoal mas como profissional eu n o posso dizer que milagres aconte am no caso do hiv aids n o posso dizer que jesus cura a infec o por hiv muito provavelmente esse paciente com o passar do tempo vai sofrer um aumento na carga viral porque parou com a medica o o cd4 vai diminuir e ele vai adoecer o que posso afirmar com rela o religi o que as pessoas muito religiosas podem ter um n vel de stress um pouco menor do que as outras se a pessoa tiver uma f muito forte na cura ela vai enfrentar a situa o com menos stress e conseq entemente vai ver uma redu o na carga viral mas isso n o significa que jesus a curou mas que o organismo vai secretar menor quantidade de horm nios de stress que sabidamente atacam as c lulas de defesa nesse caso a religi o desempenha uma fun o muito semelhante da terapia ela passa a freq entar a igreja e com isso faz um novo c rculo de amizades encontra apoio e conforto tamb m se sabe que a f contribui muito para melhorar a recupera o de v rias doen as nesse sentido a religi o muito positiva o caso se torna grave quando um pastor diz ao doente que ele deve parar de usar a medica o at onde eu saiba n o conhe o um nico caso em que jesus tenha curado algu m por procura o
48716 por mais que a m dia bombardeie as pessoas com informa es sobre o hiv aids eu noto que quando essa informa o n o participa do cotidiano da pessoa ela tende a ignor la aqui no ipra eu atendo a pessoas de todas as
48717 a primeira rea o do paciente com diagn stico recente normalmente a terapia por causa do diagn stico me contam sobre sua soropositividade mas n o querem falar sobre o assunto qualquer informa o que eu forne a nessa etapa tende a assustar muito o paciente com o desenrolar do processo terap utico a nega o cede lugar ao desespero por que o desespero se instala porque elas come am a prestar aten o nas informa es sobre a doen a e surgem as d vidas por exemplo como vou passar a transar agora quando a pessoa tem um parceiro fixo ela j tem muita dificuldade de contar que soropositivo mas muitas pessoas n o t m parceiro fixo algumas chegam a ter mais de um parceiro por semana ent o surge o dilema contar ou n o contar ao parceiro no primeiro encontro o que tenho ouvido dos meus pacientes que por exemplo quando v o a um baile conhecem uma pessoa e logo no primeiro encontro j partem para um relacionamento mais ntimo que eles n o contam ao parceiro que s o soropositivos s ap s algum tempo se o relacionamento perdurar que decidem tocar no assunto al m do dilema contar ou n o contar h v rias d vidas que perturbam muito os pacientes por exemplo como fazer sexo oral com ou sem camisinha uma queixa muito freq ente a de que os ent o quando um homem soropositivo heterossexual isso significa que as mulheres com quem eles se relacionam tamb m n o usam o preservativo isso explica porque o n mero de mulheres infectadas est crescendo de forma alarmante se o uso do preservativo fosse generalizado a epidemia n o apresentaria o crescimento explosivo que tem atualmente
48718 numa terceira etapa o desespero cede medida que as informa es v o sendo absorvidas e a pessoa consegue resolver suas d vidas a partir da preciso cuidar de todos os fatores estressantes o stress psic logico a fadiga os estados depressivos as crises existenciais todos esses fatores s o esse fato explica em parte uma d vida freq ente por que algumas pessoas apresentam rapidamente uma s rie de infec es oportunistas enquanto outras infectadas h quinze vinte anos nunca ficaram doentes porque a maneira como as pessoas reagem aos problemas cotidianos est estreitamente relacionada com as infec es oportunistas
48719 quando o paciente passa da fase do desespero e porventura sua carga viral aumenta muito e seu cd 4 diminui consideravelmente podendo inclusive come ar a apresentar doen as oportunistas o m dico infectologista o encaminha para o uso da a come a uma nova fase no processo psicoterap utico que o de lidar com os efeitos colaterais da medica o esses efeitos colaterais ainda s o devastadores em alguns casos um de meus pacientes desenvolveu um problema seri ssimo no f gado chegou a ser internado e quase morreu o infectologista que tratava dele teve que mudar a medica o anti retroviral porque ela ocasionou uma hepatite medicamentosa diarr ia incessante erup es na pele dores de cabe a cr nicas j outras pessoas n o sentem nada nenhum efeito colateral em qualquer caso do ponto de vista psic logico surge o medo da morte se eu n o tomar a medica o anti retroviral eu vou morrer mas se eu tomar a medica o vou ter que mudar o meu estilo de vida n o por causa do v rus mas pelos efeitos colaterais nessa fase a psicoterapia desempenha um papel muito importante porque uma vez que o stress a porta de entrada das infec es oportunistas quanto melhor a pessoa estiver em equil brio e de bem consigo mesma menos riscos ela vai enfrentar o imunidade est o t o estreitamente relacionados que se um soropositivo tiver um forte aborrecimento na parte da manh e na parte da tarde ele fizer o carga viral muito provavelmente ser detectada uma forte altera o no resultado do exame agora imagine como n o ficar o organismo de um por semanas ou meses est comprovado cientificamente que o stress libera essa rea o hormonal quando somada ao ataque do pr prio v rus hiv s c lulas de defesa pode deixar o soropositivo em situa o terr vel a psicoterapia contribui conduzindo o paciente a uma situa o de melhor equil brio interior aprendendo a lidar melhor com a doen a com o diagn stico de hiv positivo ajudando a pessoa a criar estrat gias para ter uma vida melhor
48720 um diagn stico positivo para hiv n o significa que a pessoa tenha que sofrer incessantemente e que n o possa mais fazer tudo o que fazia antes claro que pode mas com um pouco mais de cuidado e algumas adapta es por exemplo se a pessoa sente prazer no sexo ela n o precisa deixar de sentir esse prazer mas ter que aceitar algumas restri es um de meus pacientes antes de descobrir se soropositivo vivia em academias de gin stica depois do diagn stico por desinforma o ele parou com a atividade f sica por achar que n o podia mais fazer muscula o pode sim ao contr rio o soropositivo deve fazer atividades f sicas o n da quest o nesta etapa conciliar a rotina de vida anterior ao diagn stico com as restri es e modifica es decorrentes da doen a e do tratamento o paciente n o precisa mudar todo o seu estilo de vida mas precisa sim fazer algumas adapta es a pessoa tende a se sentir perdida no come o mas com o tempo por assim dizer ela vai se acostumando com o diagn stico e se adapta bem nova situa o soropositividade mas algumas coisas precisam ser iguais para todo mundo por exemplo quando o paciente for ao dentista ele deve comunicar ao profissional que soropositivo quando for se relacionar sexualmente caso n o se sinta vontade para contar ao parceiro que soropositivo para n o contamin lo uma informa o importante relacionado ao uso de preservativo a de que a probabilidade de que uma mulher se contamine durante a rela o sexual com um homem muito maior do que a de um homem se contaminar ao fazer sexo com uma mulher assim a responsabilidade da mulher exigir que o homem use o preservativo igual do homem ao assumir a posi o irredut vel de us lo mas muitas pessoas continuam n o usando preservativos
48721 por uma grande variedade de fatores recomenda se que o
48722 por tudo isso eu ou o muitas queixas n o do hiv mas dos efeitos da medica o quase um lugar comum as pessoas dizerem que o tratamento pior do que a doen a eu tive um paciente um rapaz muito jovem que parou o tratamento porque n o conseguiu suportar os efeitos colaterais e acabou morrendo uma outra paciente desenvolveu um quadro grave de depress o e est se tratando com antidepressivos para suportar a avalanche de sensa es e sentimentos que emergem quando se aproxima a hora de tomar a medica o ela toma uma dose de manh e outra tarde portanto ela j acorda tensa briga com todo mundo em casa xinga as pessoas tem crises de choro e a o marido dela a for a a tomar o rem dio doze horas depois j no final da tarde ela tem que tomar de novo ela me disse que o p r do sol para ela se transformou em um pesadelo porque o baixar do sol faz com que ela se lembre de que vai ter que tomar a medica o tenho outros pacientes que t m efeitos colaterais leves como uma diarr ia incomoda sim incomoda mas existe coisa muito pior do que isso resumindo uma bola de neve descendo morro abaixo o stress pode desencadear doen as oportunistas que obrigam a pessoa a partir para o tratamento delas e ou para o in cio do uso dos anti retrovirais que t m efeitos colaterais sobre o organismo e a psiqu o papel do psic logo durante todo esse processo o de ajudar estas pessoas a encontrar alternativas para lidar com todas essas situa es estressantes auxiliar na adapta o do in cio do poss vel tratamento e tamb m o de impedir que o paciente desista do tratamento caso j tenha iniciado um porque se o m dico respons vel chegou ao ponto de prescrever a medica o anti retroviral porque essa pessoa est com a carga viral alta e o cd4 muito baixo porta de entrada de doen as oportunistas nesse caso se a pessoa n o iniciar a medica o anti retroviral ou descuidar se do tratamento de alguma doen a oportunista dependendo da gravidade do conjunto de sintomas a perspectiva a de desenvolver s rios problemas de sa de ter uma doen a atr s da outra e chegar ao bito

48869 takes its language goals and aspirations as much from the crassest forms of marxism as it does from religion its leaders are as influenced by lenin sartre stalin and fanon as they are by the prophet
48870 they should unite with the working class to destroy the capitalist system
48871 a godsend to both sides the left a once dwindling band of communists trotskyites maoists and castroists had been clinging to the dregs of a clapped out cause the islamists could deliver numbers and passion but they needed a vehicle to give them purchase on the political terrain a tactical alliance became an operational imperative
48872 the practical benefits of working together are enough to compensate for the differences

48918 several years ago the secretary of defense directed the 703rd to deliver mq 9 hunter killer capabilities 18 months early resulting in the first combat employment in afghanistan in september 2007
48919 working together with air combat command and the prime contractor general atomics aeronautical systems inc all the stops were pulled out to surge the capability to the field
48920 the mq 9 without a doubt is a force multiplier and its suite of sensors and communications links provide airmen on the battlefield persistent awareness of their surroundings and a robust target prosecution capability
48921 the reaper has an electro optical sensor and high resolution radar that can see targets through the clouds and it can also carry a mix of 500 pound bombs and hellfire missiles
48922 i think the air force chief of staff stated it best the reaper is a significant evolution in capability for the air force
48923 it is an honor to command the air force and contractor teams providing this evolution in capability of reapers to successfully execute gwot missions and without a doubt this system adds to our arsenal and saves lives
48924 the air force has an extremely disciplined targeting process and strict rules of engagement
48925 these strict rules reduce collateral damage tremendously and with our accurate on board sensors we ensure the target is destroyed and nothing else
48926 we are part of a complex kill chain which involves real time command and control of the lethal assets
48927 the reaper has a great advantage over other aircraft we have small low yield weapons as well as 500 pound bombs
48928 i used to fly in the back seat of the f 15e as a weapons system operator and the feeling is very similar with the reaper you get the same feeling of accomplishment after helping the guys out on the ground as you do in an airplane that you fly in and the fact that youre not risking a pilots life in the process is an added bonus
48929 the sensor operator has the responsibility of assisting the pilot with take offs landings air speeds altitude approach speeds weapons employment and airspace deconfliction
48930 the sensor operator must have a skilled level of airmanship to cross check all the functions that are required to fly safely in any airspace
48931 fire power and persistence the reaper because its unmanned has the ability to loiter for extended periods of time and can deliver a combination of weapons if the target situation changes

48997 this has been a month of encouraging news from iraq
48998 the iraqi government has made political progress as well the progress in iraq has allowed us to continue on our policy of return on success
48999 i personally believe that there is a real possibility of some additional draw downs as we look forward
49000 im very comfortable that it gets us where we need to go from the military perspective for the requirements that we have
49001 its been spirited and i think a very healthy negotiation which in fact is still ongoing

49005 ought to jump start those video lottery terminals at aqueduct
49006 going to make these cuts as soon as they need to be made
49007 its important that we focus on stabilizing the financial system
49008 a very substantial change in the balance between growth and inflation
49009 you have to do the backstop because once you get to that point your particular choices are very limited
49010 that is a fiscal policy operation essentially something which should be set up in the treasury department
49011 i didnt do nothing yesterday one pitch one mistake i didnt try to hit him
49012 for the olympics he should be coming to me for celebrations he should get together with the fujianese
49013 the mainland government theyre communists and we dont like that
49014 the new immigrants came from china in a happier time so they like it more than i do
49015 we need a modern china and it should respect individual rights
49016 the ccba are old theyre part of taiwan we are from red china
49017 most of our people are born in the peoples republic of china and thats why theyre so close to it
49018 we are celebrating because we want the world to know that china is important
49019 people who protest about human rights in china they dont get it
49020 both sides have tried to claim that they represent the chinatown community
49021 the fujianese were taking cantonese jobs and they were looking for the same benefits so there was considerable acrimony
49022 we did in 10 years what ccba did in 120
49023 thats why all the politicians are starting to come here
49024 generally speaking theres obviously a lot of pride in the fact that for the first time in history the torch has been passed to china and thats a unanimous comment that people are saying
49025 when people think a country is undermining our industry theres a great deal of resentment for those immigrants
49026 chinatown people might have private banquets for the olympics but theyre not very likely to be overtly expressive about what they feel
49027 right to bear arms is not limited to the physical confines of the home
49028 violates the individual right to bear arms protected by the second amendment
49029 here the government does not allege that mr vargas possessed the weapon with intent to use it unlawfully or outside of his home
49030 mr vargas is accused of keeping a gun in his home this conduct is protected by the individual right to bear arms enshrined in the second amendment
49031 the question now becomes which defendants with guns in their homes should benefit from that constitutional right
49032 one issue becomes whether to allow defendants to make these types of challenges even though they never applied for the permit
49033 mr vargas is alleged in essence not to have submitted himself to the complete discretion and the extraordinary power of the new york city police commissioner
49034 an average poor guy whos particularly vulnerable to burglary or break ins is going to have a hard time getting a license
49035 its the current nypd 24 7 he has little or no time for anything else
49036 i will not sign off on any reprogramming until at least they provide us with the information by law that they are required to give us
49037 the community has money they have under spent they have not spent all the money on the areas it says in the budget and at the end of the year they want to move some money around
49038 i am not going to sign off on any of this until this kind of thing stops
49039 we have spent specifically on the provisions in the draft executive order the better part of the last two or two and a half weeks dealing with multiple committees on the hill at the staff level at the member level making experts available to provide briefings
49040 there have been countless countless hours by dozens and dozens of people whove been involved with this process discussing reviewing and walking through the provisions of the order various staffers rooms full of staffers
49041 after seven years of a go it alone presidency perhaps i should expect nothing more from this white house but this order will be binding on future administrations as well
49042 as it was the text of the order was not provided to the intelligence committee until 30 minutes before the committee was briefed and after it had been released on the web given the impact that this order will have on americas intelligence community and this committees responsibility to oversee intelligence activities this cannot be seen as anything other than an attempt to undercut congressional oversight
49043 no one would ever put up with this in their own life paying for an office they dont use or a house they dont live in but for some reason government gets away with this without any accountability or blame
49044 at a time when the city and state are in dire financial straits its very hard to ask people to tighten their belts or to pay more in taxes when government is paying for empty offices
49045 while were disappointed not to be moving into the new space sooner the 20 year lease rate we negotiated will save us money in the long term
49046 this confirms the general picture of weakness but it is surprising that gdp declined
49047 as we look forward we realize we have to grow out of a deeper hole than we thought
49048 were going to operate at a kind of lackluster growth rate for many quarters to come
49049 exports are making the difference between a near recession or mild recession and a deep recession
49050 we dont really see a recovery until some time in the spring or summer
49051 while growth continues to be disappointing trade provides one of the few bright spots
49052 we need that kind of a decline to get everyones temperature up
49053 you need capitulation a cathartic washout where investors throw in the towel in turn clearing the deck and setting the stage for a meaningful market recovery
49054 weve already seen capitulation in the financials but it has to be broader based we need a panic
49055 buying into them however is a mistake if the market is as i believe still in a primary downtrend
49056 its simply continued agony through more of a slow bleed
49057 i would stay away from the financials until we see concrete evidence of an improvement a reduction in loan losses and fewer writedowns why try to be a hero
49058 wow what a wonderful giveaway i would love to be entered thanks so much for all you do for the art community i cannot wait till my copy of the books arrives i know you will a have a huge success on your hands what a gift to us all kathy h

49153 i found there was no evidence that the gathering on 28 march 2008 was intended to be an enactment of nazi behaviour or adoption of any of its attitudes
49154 the truth of the matter is this that no grown up person gives the slightest damn about what other people do in their sex lives its not even a subject for discussion
49155 all these people who failed in formula 1 and jackie stewart fits into that category although 40 years ago he was a brilliant driver they sit on the outside offering advice but no one seriously considers them
49156 winning the case was good because it stopped all the nonsense about nazism thats the thing that really mattered now as far as doing the job is concerned the nazi thing will have no effect at all on me
49157 i think there is a strong probability that the news of the world did not just chance on it
49158 that is being investigated very carefully and in great detail at the moment and sooner or later we will know exactly what happened

49167 the united states abstained from the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president bashir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
49168 the uk did not believe it was right to consider such an issue as part of unamids mandate
49169 we will not stand in the way of a security council discussion although that discussion will raise profound questions about the balance of peace and justice
49170 it raises a flag as to some sort of organized initiative to evade detection
49171 the low number of violations puts into perspective that most athletes are drug free
49172 but you hear about the celebrated doping cases and the notion becomes that this is a useless battle quite the opposite i think this is all positive in doping reform
49173 this thing was so well chosen there is nothing we can do weve simply been removed and our hands are tied
49174 nobody is providing justification for those people who violate the wada rules

49176 the bombs of ahmedabad and bangalore are an attack on the social harmony of the whole of india carried out by fanatics who cause death and devastation
49177 the catholic church in india energetically condemns this senseless violence having placed her own means immediately at the disposal of the victims

49183 these magical rainbow seed are for you to color your day
49184 the purpose of the bombs is obvious to destabilize a situation that is already quite unsettled clearly this is the way to interpret such an incident a day before the decision
49185 the appeal we can launch is of little value as we are not such a representative reality
49186 nevertheless the appeal is made to enable democracy to prevail in this country
49187 our world has grown weary of greed exploitation and division of the tedium of false idols and piecemeal responses and the pain of false promises

49189 saw a great need for comprehensive marriage preparation that spanned a weekend and covered very important topics in marriage such as the faith communication children and finances
49190 though it is more social and not as intense at the three to get married weekend
49191 ongoing guidance at least in the first 10 years is of the utmost importance
49192 my husband and i have been married three and a half years
49193 but i can definitely say despite a very happy marriage we need lots of support and guidance all young married couples need guidance because it is hard and guidance from a priest or from another more experienced couple can really help you persevere
49194 in marriage two people meld two lives into one and we need as much prayer and support as we can get it is important to hear over and over again that the most joy will come from what seems the most challenging giving yourself for your spouse and for your children
49195 most parishes offer bible classes catechesis and mens and womens groups you dont often see programs specifically for couples to build marriages
49196 i believe this is where the laity need to get involved according to vatican ii we are called to get involved and support our pastors he cant do it all
49197 couples that are living marriages faithful to the teachings of the church need to be out there supporting one another and boldly proclaiming the truth about marriage that is the goal of three to stay married an environment where young couples can get started on the right foot in living the churchs teachings and sharing that message with other married couples who may need support
49198 we have to get involved and support our priests by living and preaching the truth
49199 as many famous spiritual writers have said we prepare for the business or professional world with years of study but somehow we embark on the most important decision of our life marriage and the spouse we choose with little to no reflection
49200 i think a weekend for marriage preparation although even too short for such an important decision is the only way to make it as comprehensive as possible it is difficult to live a catholic marriage in our society today so sufficient preparation is essential but unfortunately it is missing in some dioceses due to a lack of resources support or simple man power
49201 our task in the three to get married program is to impart to participants what it means to be married in the church and what that entails in their daily married life
49202 even for couples who are there simply because they want the traditional church ceremony if they are sincere find that they can glean useful information from the weekend and may even have a change of heart or conversion by the end
49203 the human but more importantly the spiritual transformation of the couples participating cannot be underestimated on these weekends
49204 one of the big issues of sexual ethics is that of family planning
49205 three to get married covers the church teaching on natural family planning and birth control and several of the other talks cover treating your spouse respectfully in the sexual act making it an act of mutual love and not simply self serving
49206 we live in a culture where the catholic ideal of marriage being a gift of self and being open to life are often challenged by society and even family

49208 the vmware virtual appliance marketplace is a great vehicle for our appliance and is a user friendly high value place to shop companies are rapidly deploying virtualization technology because of its clear financial benefits however the potential security threats are often overlooked said juliette sultan head of global marketing at check point software technologies our vpn 1 security solution fully supports vmware esxi implementations so customers can protect the data communication on their virtual networks with the same proven security used to protect their physical networks by utilizing the open virtualization format ovf for our virtual appliance mindtouch deki becomes even easier for customers to test drive and use
49209 the ability to easily import and deploy our virtual appliance with vmware esxi means fewer troubleshooting issues and a higher adoption rate two keys to advancing deki in the marketplace the spread of vmware esxi will no doubt contribute to the ongoing success of mindtouch deki

49211 vmware esxi confirms vmware s trajectory to keep layering on the breakthroughs said stephen dennis president of virtualappliances
49212 everything in nature is in spirit it isnt spoiled by ego nor can it ever be so when nature speaks to us we should listen intently when a wild bird touches us for instance or a fish brushes by when were swimming in the ocean or lake i believe that its a direct communication from our source of being since these creations of god instinctively keep their distance when they depart from their dna patterns to actually contact us physically i think we should pay attention
49213 good night my guardian angel the day has sped away well spent or ill its story is written down for aye and now of gods kind providence thou image pure and bright watch over me while im sleeping my angel dear good night
49214 consultations at the iaea relating to the nuclear deal with india
49215 significant steps are being taken in relationships between the bishops
49216 we might not have reached consensus in fact we certainly havent reached consensus but i believe people are feeling that significant growth is occurring
49217 head to head debates that create winners or losers do not necessarily resolve difficult issues in the life of the church as compared to face to face encounters
49218 its more important to be faithful to the gospel than faithful to each other
49219 we dont see why welcoming the gay or lesbian person into the church must mean blessing what they do in the churchs name for example blessing same sex relationships or accepting them for ordination for example as bishops whatever their lifestyle
49220 acknowledging the spiritual gifts of gay and lesbian believers they will certainly be likely to feel that the restraint you ask for is a betrayal please try to see why this is such a dilemma for many of us
49221 we seem often to be threatening death to each other not offering life
49222 what some see as confused or reckless innovation in some provinces the ordination of gene robinson in america for example is felt as a body blow to integrity of mission and as a matter of physical risk to christians to anglicans living tensely with muslim neighbours in northern nigeria for instance
49223 but nor are we like the international lutheran federation were somewhere in the middle
49224 unless we do have something about which we consent which we trust to resolve some of our differences we shall be flying further apart
49225 there have to be protocols and conventions by which we recognise each other as churches and by which we understand and manage exchanges between us
49226 thrust for evangelisation animates both the anglican communion and the roman catholic church
49227 much is spoken today of diseases like alzheimers and parkinsons
49228 by analogy their symptoms can at times be found even in our own christian communities for example when we live myopically in the fleeting present oblivious to our past heritage and apostolic traditions we could well be suffering from spiritual alzheimers
49229 and when we behave in a disorderly manner going whimsically on our own way without any coordination with the head or the other members of our community it could be ecclesial churchlike parkinsons
49230 the great pity is that to have those voices would have been a healing and helpful thing
49231 corporately the american house of bishops asked for forgiveness last year
49232 and 50 of the provinces individual autonomous national anglican churches or a bit more said thats probably all right
49233 the bishops represent not only their dioceses but also the worldwide fellowship and thats the rationale
49234 what counts for me as wrong is any relationship outside a covenant of mutual love and support
49235 i dont think that sex outside marriage is as god purposes it
49236 in the question of same sex relationships the lambeth conference has made its views clear and that is the position i hold as archbishop
49237 on this moon clouds with convective movements are formed and therefore static electrical fields and stormy conditions can be produced
49238 aww fuck what the hell did i do last nite
49239 yoga puts our experience of enlightenment at the exact center of our being though we may appear separate from one another we are no more separate than the wave is separate from the sea or than the air in a glass jar is separate from the surrounding air we are pervaded by and animated by the same spirit the same nature and that nature is constant through the manifold changes of birth growth and dissolution it cannot be wounded or separated from itself

49255 whats happening in china should be seen as a marker for what is going to hit the rest of the developing world if we fail to act
49256 we need to find the right investments and regulations to encourage people to adopt a healthy lifestyle or we risk facing higher rates of death disease and disability and the related costs
49257 the classical chinese diet rich in vegetables and carbohydrates with minimal animal sourced food no longer exists
49258 in 2006 fewer than one percent of all chinese adults consumed a diet with less than 10 percent of energy derived from fat
49259 based on fairly conservative assumptions the total impact of these nutrition related components of poor diet inactivity and obesity on medical costs to treat noncommunicable diseases labor productivity and national production are very large
49260 im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
49261 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
49262 using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues
49263 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
49264 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
49265 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
49266 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
49267 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking sen
49268 pointing out your opponents worldwide celebrity is not the low road and neither is pointing out that he opposes oil drilling and supports higher taxes
49269 my independence hasnt always made me friends in washington i was not elected ms congeniality in the united states senate
49270 my concern with sen obama is that on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
49271 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
49272 you havent heard a positive thing out of that campaign in a month all they do is try to run me down
49273 should allow ample time for a decision before the general election
49274 i am looking forward to this trial as a way of finally showing the truth that im innocent
49275 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
49276 why the senator would like to have this matter commenced and concluded before the elections and by all indications that is possible
49277 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
49278 i have to accept that i appear to be the fall guy and may be the fall guy
49279 i suspect an agreement has been reached or an understanding has been reached
49280 it may well have been done by the executive board done in another place by very senior people in the ioc it may have taken into consideration new circumstances in this year leading up to the games where there has been quite a lot of trauma around china and within china
49281 this certainly isnt what we guaranteed the international media and its certainly contrary to normal circumstances of reporting on olympic games
49282 having understood yesterday that there were difficulties with access to some sites which obviously goes against our desire to always have media having access they need we understand that the organizers tomorrow will confirm how they have remedied the situation
49283 its important to stress that there has not at any stage been a deal where the ioc has entered into an agreement with china to censor the internet there has been no deal with china to censor the internet
49284 some of our guys have inherent breathing issues and to put them in this environment its worrisome for sure
49285 every athlete the clean ones and the not clean ones should clearly know that we mean business
49286 the ioc will do everything that is humanly possible to have the cleanest possible games
49287 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
49288 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
49289 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
49290 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
49291 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare

49299 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
49300 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
49301 if he was given his release theres no guarantee hed go anywhere to play
49302 however hed have the freedom to choose if he should decide to play
49303 i went back to the room after meetings heard it saw it just kind of chuckled because i have no idea where it came from i have no idea where those stories come from
49304 you dont know where it comes from it seems like its something different everyday
49305 i thought that would be something they wouldnt do or try to stay away from as far as here i like the guys we have behind center right now in kyle and rex and i think those guys can definitely take us through
49306 today i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
49307 it is an unwise and unfortunate move to cause economic strife to public servants and their families who are working hard and playing by the rules

49309 generated directly from elderly patients with chronic disease using material that has been exposed to disease causing agents for a life time and whether such patient specific cells could be differentiated into the particular cell types that would be needed to treat or study the patients condition
49310 it is particularly encouraging that neither the advanced age nor the severely disabling disease of the patient prevented us from reprogramming her fibroblasts
49311 this approach would allow study of living motor neurons generated from als cases with unknown genetic lesions

49313 tata steel results are in line with expectations global prices have risen by almost 50 this year and are expected to remain firm in the medium term domestic steel players have taken a hit on their margins due to rising input costs as they have been unable to pass on the same due to governments intervention which has prevented steel companies from raising prices in wake of the high inflationary pressures tata steel has however been an exception on account of it being the most efficient player owing to the backward integrated nature of its business

49319 that was probably one of the worst nights of the year for the guys
49320 it would have been an entertaining game to watch but it wasnt that good being on the losing side its still fresh in our memories its good motivation for the weekend

49343 a digital circuit needs wire in order to transmit signals to different parts of the circuit the wire in a visual representation of a digital circuit is part of the drawing itself which can be perceived only in two ways
49344 an input to a digital circuit is a zero or one similarly an input to a visual version of the circuit is an unambiguous cue to the tilt at that part of the circuit
49345 visually represented not gates flip a boxs perceived tilt as you work through a circuit and or gates are designed with transparency cues so that the elicited perception is always that the box is tilted toward you unless overridden
49346 the and gate is similarly designed with transparency cues but contrary to the or gate it will always favor the perception that it is tilted away from you
49347 not only may our visual system one day give dna computation a run for its money but visual circuits have many potential advantages for teaching logic
49348 people are notoriously poor logical reasoners someday visual circuits may enable logic poor individuals to see their way through complex logical formulae
49349 my hope is that other perception and illusion experts will think of novel visual components which serve to mimic some digital circuit component thereby enriching the powers of visual circuits

49493 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
49494 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck it s divisive negative shameful and wrong
49495 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe they re using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues he ll continue to talk about
49496 this response came in response to comments made by sen
49497 got a funny name and he doesn t look like all the presidents on the dollar bills
49498 john mccain is the american president americans have been waiting for
49499 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
49500 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
49501 for mccain to win in such troubled times he needs to begin telling the american people how he intends to lead us that mccain exists he can inspire the country to greatness
49502 sorry senator mccain ill be right back senator mccain do you still like me
49503 even if you never met him you know this guy hes the guy at the country club with the beautiful date holding a martini and a cigarette that stands against the wall and makes snide comments about everyone who passes by
49504 facts are but the play things of lawyers tops and hoops forever a spin
49505 i wouldnt trust a member of the press to run a salad bar at this point
49506 if we crudely make race a regular part of the daily political maelstrom no one is well served
49507 true they are both ads that involve white women and black candidates but that is not in itself evidence of a racial overtone can i say my view is a provable fact no that is my opinion
49508 okay so lets move on racism is very real and it will sadly play some as yet undetermined role in this campaign but we can deal with issues of race responsibly calmly respectfully and with understanding if we crudely make it a regular part of the daily political maelstrom no one is well served
49509 one of the big tests for our nation this election will be whether we the press the campaigns the voters can handle the complex powder keg that is race in a responsible way that improves us all
49510 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
49511 handle race in a responsible way that improves us all
49512 this is a typically superfluous response from barack obama like most celebrities he reacts to fair criticism with a mix of fussiness and hysteria
49513 if youre white youre all right if youre brown sit down if youre black get back
49514 i am not against analyzing the role race and racism have historically played or even questioning how it may be being played in this campaign
49515 its one thing to accuse me of being biased towards mccain a charge i categorically reject but decline to argue in the comments
49516 aww you guys always getting mad at me for defending john mccain
49517 this is the moment the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
49518 on friday john mccain told reporters on his campaign bus that he had issued a clear directive to his people about negative campaigning
49519 you dont need to tear anybody else down to get the votes for john mccain
49520 thats the point you can contrast your vote with theirs but you dont need to tear anybody else down to get the vote for john mccain
49521 in the home of the brave jefferson turning over in his grave fools glorifying themselves trying to manipulate satan and theres slow slow train coming up around the bend big time negotiators false healers and woman haters masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition but the enemy i see wears a cloak of decency all non believers and men stealers talking in the name of religion and theres slow theres slow train coming up around the bend
49522 but we can deal with issues of race responsibly calmly respectfully and with understanding if we crudely make it a regular part of the daily political maelstrom no one is well served
49523 if we crudely make it a regular part of the daily political maelstrom no one is well served
49524 steve schmidt has told his communications staff that he will fire any campaign operative on sight who even thinks of trying to exploit racial prejudice
49525 which schmidt defines as intentional use of the term uppity n r in public

49530 black snake moan oversexed white women threatened stolen by scary black man
49531 but we can deal with issues of race responsibly calmly respectfully and with understanding
49532 that is factually wrong how can sen obama say that he looks just like all those blokes immortalized on on mt rushmore
49533 there is no doubt that the mccain campaign will try to make the case that obama is presumptuous is that automatically racist i dont think so there is a case to be made the presidential seal the big foreign trip the big rhetoric this the worlds moment etc now i understand that the claim will be made that any flik towards arrogance is a racist attack but i also hope these discussions are held respectfully look back up at this comment thread its one thing to accuse me of being biased towards mccain a charge i categorically reject but decline to argue in the comments but then it gets trickier when i get accused of covering up racism thats the difference this is a very explosive topic which is not well suited to the rough rhetoric of a political campaign it can escalate very quickly especially if the campaigns are directing it thats my point we just have to be more careful and respectful when we tread into these waters which we should tread into
49534 not only did we play the race card we dealt it from the bottom of the deck
49535 totally makes the vapid celebrity for being a celebrity point

49556 estimates are for 15 cents a share starbucks will miss that
49557 consolidated net revenues increased 9 percent to 2 6 billion for the third quarter of 2008 compared to 2 4 billion for the third quarter of 2007 for the 13 week period ended june 29 2008 starbucks reported a net loss of 6 7 million compared to net income of 158 3 million for the same period a year ago earnings per share eps for the quarter was 0 01 compared to eps of 0 21 per share earned in the prior year period the company estimates that costs associated with the ongoing implementation of its transformation agenda impacted third quarter 2008 eps by approximately 0 17 per share primarily for restructuring charges associated with the u s company operated store closures announced on july 1 2008 totaling 167 7 million pre tax or 0 14 per share after tax
49558 the combination of all these actions is estimated to result in a pre tax benefit of approximately 200 million to 210 million in fiscal 2009 which equates to approximately 0 17 to 0 18 of eps the beneficial impact estimated here excludes the related carry over of the lease termination and severance costs from the store closure actions
49559 of note many of the companys operating expenses are fixed in nature as a result the softness in u s revenues during the third quarter fiscal 2008 impacted nearly all consolidated and u s segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales
49560 starbucks now expects full year fiscal 2008 non gaap eps to be in the mid seventy cent range which excludes the 0 19 year to date impact from restructuring and other transformation costs as well as additional costs to be incurred in the fourth quarter related to executing on recently announced decisions full year fiscal 2008 eps on a gaap basis will be impacted by the remaining restructuring charges that are expected to be spread across the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and the first half of fiscal 2009 the timing of which is dependent on lease termination negotiations with third parties in line with this revised view starbucks anticipates total net revenue growth of approximately 11 percent in fiscal year 2008 these targets reflect the companys current assumption that fourth quarter company operated comparable store sales trends will remain relatively stable with the third quarter
49561 the companys lower than expected revenue growth was driven by continued slow traffic trends in the u s which resulted in a mid single digit decline in u s comparable store sales and was a slight deterioration from the second quarter

49771 there is an enormous difference a literally life and death difference between individual bank failures and a systemic banking failure i do not believe we are facing a systemic banking failure but we are facing more individual bank failures beginning in december 2007 the federal reserve system has sold treasury debt whenever it has increased its purchase of questionable assets that it has bought from banks and large financial institutions it has unloaded about 40 of its holdings of liquid treasury debt this has kept it from inflating the money supply at a dramatic rate at some point it will run out of treasury debt to sell to the general public in order to offset the increase of its purchase of questionable assets held by the financial system at that point the great inflation will begin this could be a year away this could be a month away all we know is this when the federal reserve system runs out of treasury debt to sell its purchase of all assets will be inflationary the banking system as a whole is protected what is not protected is the purchasing power of the dollar

49775 what do you intend to ask and learn from us for we are ready to die rather than transgress the laws of our fathers

49777 will you eat rather than have your body punished limb by limb
49778 you accursed wretch you dismiss us from this present life but the king of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life because we have died for his laws
49779 i got these from heaven and because of his laws i disdain them and from him i hope to get them back again
49780 one cannot but choose to die at the hands of men and to cherish the hope that god gives of being raised again by him but for you there will be no resurrection to life
49781 because you have authority among men mortal though you are you do what you please but do not think that god has forsaken our people keep on and see how his mighty power will torture you and your descendants
49782 do not deceive yourself in vain for we are suffering these things on our own account because of our sins against our own god therefore astounding things have happened but do not think that you will go unpunished for having tried to fight against god
49783 i do not know how you came into being in my womb it was not i who gave you life and breath nor i who set in order the elements within each of you therefore the creator of the world who shaped the beginning of man and devised the origin of all things will in his mercy give life and breath back to you again since you now forget yourselves for the sake of his laws
49784 my son have pity on me i carried you nine months in my womb and nursed you for three years and have reared you and brought you up to this point in your life and have taken care of you i beseech you my child to look at the heaven and the earth and see everything that is in them and recognize that god did not make them out of things that existed thus also mankind comes into being do not fear this butcher but prove worthy of your brothers accept death so that in gods mercy i may get you back again with your brothers
49785 what are you waiting for i will not obey the kings command but i obey the command of the law that was given to our fathers through moses but you who have contrived all sorts of evil against the hebrews will certainly not escape the hands of god for we are suffering because of our own sins and if our living lord is angry for a little while to rebuke and discipline us he will again be reconciled with his own servants but you unholy wretch you most defiled of all men do not be elated in vain and puffed up by uncertain hopes when you raise your hand against the children of heaven you have not yet escaped the judgment of the almighty all seeing god for our brothers after enduring a brief suffering have drunk of everflowing life under gods covenant but you by the judgment of god will receive just punishment for your arrogance i like my brothers give up body and life for the laws of our fathers appealing to god to show mercy soon to our nation and by afflictions and plagues to make you confess that he alone is god and through me and my brothers to bring to an end the wrath of the almighty which has justly fallen on our whole nation

49790 many people are of the assumption that aircraft lavatories dump overboard when they are flushed this is not the case lavatory waste is contained on the aircraft in a holding tank until the aircraft lands when the aircraft is safely on the ground only ground crew personnel may operate the valve to dump the waste tank while in flight it is physically impossible for the pilots to dump the waste water because the valve is usually located on the exterior of the aircraft

49803 i knew the people of iowa wouldnt vote based on race
49804 its not just that the faa fisa amendment act gives immunity to the telcoms it also shields elected officials from past present and possibly even future lawbreaking activities it in essence paves the way for the rule of men to take precedence over the rule of law
49805 little children cannot distinguish between symbols and reality which is why they have a hard time with the idea that names are arbitrary obama seems to have the same problem with this kind of magical thinking which puts him on a par with most preschoolers
49806 berstein reports on cnn no rollcall vote no name in nomination no convention participation beyond the tuesday night speech

49814 myiq thats one of the nightmares of this election the dems are about to nominate a man who really and truly is everything the republicans have been smearing us about for years he really is a snob an elitist a tax and spend out of touch an empty suit with no realistic ideas weak on foreign policy etc they were wrong on one thing hes no liberal but he tries to pretend he is so ironically well um theyll get hit with that too

49816 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
49817 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
49818 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
49819 took everybody by surprise because the african union is a partner in the darfur issue
49820 ah yes new york thats a very interesting place do you know about new yorkers who keep talking about the fact that they want to leave but never do
49821 oh i dont think its that way at all i think new york is the new model for the new concentration camp where the camp has been built by the inmates themselves and the inmates are the guards and they have this pride in the thing theyve built and so they exist in a state of schizophrenia where they are both guards and prisoners and as a result they no longer have having been lobotomized the capacity to leave the prison theyve made or to even see it as a prison

49827 is an equitable doctrine designed to prevent unwarranted extension of the claims beyond a fair scope of the patentees invention
49828 the use of o40 in an amount sufficient to cause the formation of micelles and thereby provide robust stability to the formulation by preventing interactions between kt and bac
49829 is irrelevant because both formulations are encompassed by the claims of the 493 patent
49830 principles of fairness should prevent application of claim preclusion given the change in the law of obviousness following the supreme courts opinion in
49831 in order for the parties to present expert testimony and to allow the court to make credibility determinations with respect to fact witnesses
49832 there are no credibility determinations to be made here the prosecution record speaks for itself moreover experts engaging in hindsight cannot change the facts and circumstances of the patent application process that occurred two decades ago

49841 basic premise of double patenting is that the same invention cannot be patented twice
49842 although there are differences between the 812 patent and the 086 patent those differences are insufficient to support the patentability of the 812 patent in light of the 086 patent
49843 a dual problem is presented in that the terminal disclaimer was not only filed at or near the conclusion of trial in this action but it was also filed after the expiration of the earlier 086 patent
49844 the federal circuit has at least suggested in dicta that for a terminal disclaimer to be effective the earlier filed patent must not have expired at the time of the filing of the disclaimer
49845 because neither case involved a terminal disclaimer in the context of a section 156 patent term extension

49968 if you have a couple of players who are struggling you owe it to the rest of the team and to yourselves to try to get as good as you possibly can
49969 remember we didnt have the prototypical guy out there in the first place
49970 he said i dont know that youre going to see that guy from seattle
49971 its so difficult to go up against a doctor here
49972 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
49973 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
49974 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
49975 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
49976 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
49977 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
49978 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
49979 you have value on the ground more than you spent
49980 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
49981 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
49982 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
49983 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
49984 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
49985 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
49986 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
49987 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
49988 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
49989 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
49990 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
49991 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
49992 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
49993 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
49994 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
49995 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
49996 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
49997 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
49998 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
49999 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
